The term KGB is used both generally to denote the Soviet

foundation as the Cheka in 1917 and, more specifically, to 
refer to State Security after 1954 when it took its final 
name. 



THE TRANSLITERATION OF 
RUSSIAN NAMES 


We have followed a simplified version of the method 
used by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names and BBC 
Monitering Service. Simplifications include the 
substitution of “y” for “iy” in surnames (Trotsky rather 
than Trotskiy) and of “i” for “iy” in first names (Yuri 
rather than Yuriy). The “y” between the letters “i” and/or 
“e” is omitted (for example, Andreev and Dmitrievich — 
not Andreyev and Dmitriyevich), as is the apostrophe 
used to signify a soft sign. 

In cases where a mildly deviant English version of a 
well-known Russian name has become firmly established, 
we have retained that version, for example: Beria, 
Evdokia (Petrova), Izvestia, Joseph (Stalin), Khrushchev, 
Nureyev and the names of Tsars. 



FOREWORD 


I have written this book in consultation with Vasili 
Mitrokhin, based on the extensive top secret material 
(described in Chapter 1) which he has smuggled out from 
the KGB foreign intelligence archive. For the past quarter 
of a century, Mitrokhin has passionately wanted this 
material, which for twelve years he risked his life to 
assemble, to see the light of day. He wished to reveal 
“how thin the thread of peace actually was during the 
Cold War.” From that passion this book has been bom. I 
have felt it my duty to ensure that this material, which 
offers detailed and often unique insights into the workings 
of the Soviet State and the history of the Soviet Union, 
achieves the level of public awareness and recognition 
that it deserves. 

Like all archives, those of the KGB require 
interpretation in the light of previous research and related 
documents. The end notes and bibliography provide full 
details of the additional sources used to place Mitrokhin’ s 
revelations in historical context. These sources also 
provide overwhelming corroborative evidence for his 
genuineness as a source. 

Codenames (also known as “worknames” in the case of 
KGB officers) appear in the text in capitals. Many KGB 
codenames were used more than once. In such cases, the 



text and index make clear which individual is referred to. 
It is also important to note that, although certain 
individuals were targeted by the KGB, and may have been 
given codenames, this does not mean that the persons 
named were conscious or witting agents or sources — or 
even that they were aware that they were being targeted 
for recruitment or political influence operations. 
Similarly, the fact that an individual may have endorsed a 
position that was favorable to the Soviet Union does not 
necessarily mean that this person was working as an 
agent, or agent of influence, for the KGB. The KGB 
frequently gave prominent policymakers codenames in 
order to protect the identity of their targets, and to order 
recruited KGB agents to target such individuals. 

For legal reasons, some of the Soviet agents identified 
in KGB files can be referred to in this book only by their 
codenames. In a limited number of cases, chiefly because 
of the risk of prejudicing a possible prosecution, no 
reference can be made to them at all. These omissions do 
not, so far as I am aware, significantly affect the main 
conclusions of any chapter.

INTRODUCTION TO THE 
PAPERBACK EDITION 


On October 17, 1995, 1 was invited to the post-modem 
London headquarters of the Secret Intelligence Service 
(better known as SIS or MI6) at Vauxhall Cross on the 
banks of the Thames to be briefed on one of the most 
remarkable intelligence coups of the late twentieth 
century. SIS told me how in 1992 it had exfiltrated from 
Russia a retired senior KGB archivist, Vasili Mitrokhin, 
his family and six large cases of top-secret material from 
the KGB’s foreign intelligence archive. Mitrokhin ’s 
staggering feat in noting KGB files almost every working 
day for a period of twelve years and smuggling his notes 
out of its foreign intelligence headquarters at enormous 
personal risk is probably unique in intelligence history. 
When I first saw Mitrokhin’ s archive a few weeks after 
the briefing, both its scope and secrecy took my breath 
away. It contained important new material on KGB 
operations around the world. The only European countries 
absent from the archive were the pocket states of Andorra, 
Monaco and Liechtenstein. (There was, however, some 
interesting material on San Marino.) It was clear that 
Mitrokhin had had access to even the most highly 
classified KGB files - among them those which gave the 



real identities and “legends” of the Soviet “illegals” living 
under deep cover abroad disguised as foreign nationals.- 

Soon after my first examination of the archive, I met 
Vasili Mitrokhin over tea in a conference room at SIS 
headquarters and discussed collaborating with him in a 
history based on his material. Mitrokhin said little about 
himself Indeed it later required some persuasion to 
convince him that it was worth including his own story at 
the beginning of our book. But Mitrokhin was passionate 
about his archive and anxious that as much of it as 
possible be used to expose the record of the KGB. 

Early in 1996 Mitrokhin and his family paid their first 
visit to Cambridge University, where I am Professor of 
Modem and Contemporary History. I met them outside 
the Porters’ Lodge at Corpus Christi College, of which 
I’m a Fellow, and we had lunch together in a private room 
overlooking the medieval Old Court (the oldest complete 
court in Cambridge). After lunch we went to the College 
Hall to look at what is believed to be the only surviving 
portrait of the College’s first spy and greatest writer - the 
Elizabethan dramatist Christopher Marlowe, who had 
been killed in a pub brawl in 1593 at the age of only 
twenty-nine, probably while working for the secret 
service of Queen Elizabeth I. Then we walked along the 
Backs through King’s and Clare colleges to visit Trinity 
and Trinity Hall, the colleges of the KGB’s best-known 
British recmits, the “Magnificent Five,” some of whose 
files Mitrokhin had noted.- Mitrokhin had long ago 


mastered the art of being inconspicuous. The friends and 
colleagues whom we met as we walked round Cambridge 
did not give him a second glance. 

In March 1996 the then Foreign Secretary, Malcolm 
Rifkind, gave approval in principle (later confirmed by 
his successor, Robin Cook) for me to write a book based 
on Mitrokhin’s extraordinary archive.- For the next three 
and a half years, because the archive was still classified, I 
was able to discuss none of it with colleagues in Corpus 
Christi College and the Cambridge History Faculty-or 
even to reveal the nature of the book that I was writing. In 
Britain at least, the secret of the Mitrokhin archive was 
remarkably well kept. Until The Mitrokhin Archive went 
to the publishers, who also successfully avoided leaks, the 
secret was known, outside the intelligence community, 
only to a small number of senior ministers and civil 
servants. Tony Blair was first briefed on Mitrokhin while 
Leader of the Opposition in January 1995. Three years 
later, as Prime Minister, he endorsed the publication 
project.- 

The secret of the Mitrokhin archive was less rigorously 
preserved by some of Britain’s allies. But though there 
were a few partial leaks by foreign governments and 
intelligence agencies which had been given access to parts 
of the archive, none had much resonance in Britain. In 
December 1998, I received out of the blue a phone call 
from a German journalist who had discovered both the 
codename by which Mitrokhin was known in Germany 


and the contents of some fragments of Mitrokhin’s 
German material. He told me he knew I was completing a 
first volume based on the Mitrokhin archive and had 
already planned a second. For the next few months I 
expected the story to break in the British press. Somewhat 
to my surprise, it did not do so. 

On Saturday, September 11, 1999, after three and a half 
years of secrecy and silence. The Mitrokhin Archive 
suddenly became front-page news when serialization 
began in The Times. Between Friday night and Saturday 
morning I moved from a long period in which I had not 
talked at all about The Mitrokhin Archive in public to a 
month in which I seemed to talk about little else. 
Unsurprisingly, the revelations which captured media 
attention were human-interest stories about Soviet spies in 
Britain rather than the more important but less parochial 
disclosures about KGB operations against NATO as a 
whole and against democratic dissent within the Soviet 
Bloc. Hitherto the media stereotype of a major Soviet spy 
in Britain, modeled on Kim Philby and his friends, had 
been of a bright but subversive Cambridge graduate, 
preferably from a good public school and with an exotic 
sex life. In September 1999 the stereotype changed almost 
overnight with Mitrokhin’s unmasking of Melita 
Norwood, an 87-year-old great-grandmother from 
Bexleyheath memorably described by The Times as “The 
Spy Who Came In from the Co-op” (where, for 
ideological reasons, she does most of her shopping), as 



the longest-serving of all Soviet spies in Britain. 

A Times reporter was with Mrs. Norwood early on the 
morning of September 11 as she listened to John 
Humphrys on the Today program first recount some of the 
contents of her KGB file noted by Mitrokhin, then 
interview myself and Ann Widdecombe. “Oh dear!” she 
told the Times reporter. “This is all so different from my 
quiet little life. I thought I’d got away with it. But I’m not 
that surprised it’s finally come out.” Within a few hours, a 
media scrum had gathered expectantly outside Mrs. 
Norwood’s end-of- terrace house, interviewing friends and 
neighbours about how she drank tea from a Che Guevara 
mug, put “Stop Trident” posters in her window, sold 
home-made chutney in aid of Cuban support groups, and 
delivered more than thirty copies of the Morning Star 
every Saturday morning to veterans of the Bexleyheath 
Old Left. Mrs. Norwood behaved with extraordinary 
composure when she emerged later in the day to face the 
media for the first time in her life. The image of the 
greatgranny spy walking down her garden path between 
well-tended rose bushes to make a confession of sorts to a 
large crowd of reporters caught the imagination of 
millions of television viewers and newspaper-readers. 
“I’m 87 and unfortunately my memory is not what it 
was,” Mrs. Norwood began. “I did what I did not to make 
money but to help prevent the defeat of a new system 
which had, at great cost, given ordinary people food and 
fares which they could afford, given them education and a 



health service.” 

As well as being a media sensation, Mrs. Norwood’s 
guarded public confession was a remarkable historical 
document. What had captured her imagination before the 
Second World War, like that of most other Soviet agents 
of the time, was not the brutal reality of Stalin’s Russia 
but the idealistic myth- image of the world’s first worker- 
peasant state which had abolished unemployment and for 
the first time enabled working people to realize their full 
potential - the “new system” nostalgically recalled by 
Mrs. Norwood when she spoke to reporters. In the mid 
1930s that myth-image was so powerful that, for true 
believers who, unlike Melita Simis (as she then was), 
were able to go on pilgrimage to the Soviet Union, it 
survived even the contrary evidence of their own eyes. 
Malcolm Muggeridge, probably the best of the British 
journalists then in Moscow, later wrote of the British 
pilgrims he encountered: 

Their delight in all they saw and were told, and the 
expression they gave to that delight, constitute 
unquestionably one of the wonders of our age. There 
were earnest advocates of the humane killing of 
cattle who looked up at the massive headquarters of 
the OGPU [later the KGB] with tears of gratitude in 
their eyes, earnest advocates of proportional 
representation who eagerly assented when the 
necessity for a Dictatorship of the Proletariat was 



explained to them, earnest clergymen who reverently 
turned the pages of atheistic literature, earnest 
pacifists who watched delightedly tanks rattle across 
Red Square and bombing planes darken the sky, 
earnest town-planning specialists who stood outside 
overcrowded ramshackle tenements and muttered: 

“If only we had something like this in England!” The 
almost unbelievable credulity of these mostly 
university educated tourists astounded even Soviet 
officials used to handling foreign visitors... - 

When Melita Simis became a Soviet agent in 1937, the 
Soviet Union was in the midst of the Great Terror - the 
greatest peacetime persecution in modem European 
history.- Mrs. Norwood, however, still does not seem to 
grasp the depravity of the Stalinist regime into whose 
service she entered. “Old Joe [Stalin],” she acknowledges, 
“wasn’t a hundred percent, but then the people around 
him might have been making things awkward, as folks 
do.” At the end of her press statement, she was asked if 
she had any regrets about her career as a Soviet agent. 
“No,” she replied, then went back inside her house. In 
another interview she declared, “I would do everything 
again. - 

Another former Soviet spy identified in The Mitrokhin 
Archive who made front-page news in Britain was ex- 
Detective Sergeant John Symonds. Like Norwood, 
Symonds gave a number of interviews. Symonds 


confessed to being, as Mitrokhin’s notes reveal, probably 
the first British “Romeo spy” recruited by the KGB. He 
said that he had admitted as much almost twenty years 
earlier to MI5 and Scotland Yard but had been 
disbelieved. Though Mitrokhin’s notes give no statistics 
of the number of women seduced by Symonds during his 
career as a KGB illegal, Symonds claims that there were 
“hundreds” of them. Initially the KGB decided that his 
sexual technique was deficient and, to his delight, sent 
“two extremely beautiful girls” to act as his instructors. 
Symonds ’s recollection of his subsequent career as a 
Romeo spy is rather rosier than suggested by his KGB 
file: 


I just had a nice life. I’d say join the KGB, see the 
world - first class. I went all over the world on these 
jobs and I had a marvellous time. I stayed in the best 
hotels, I visited all the best beaches. I’ve had access 
to beautiful women, unlimited food, champagne, 
caviar, whatever you like, and I had a wonderful 
time. That was my KGB experience. 

“The only people I hurt,” Symonds now claims, “was 
the Metropolitan Police.”- Many of the women he 
seduced on KGB instructions would doubtless disagree. 

Media reaction to Mitrokhin’s revelations was as 
parochial in most other countries as it was in Britain. The 
public appeal of the Russian agents identified by 


Mitrokhin is curiously similar to that of Olympic medal- 
winners. In espionage as in athletics, most of the world’s 
media are interested first and foremost in the exploits of 
their own nationals. The human- interest stories which 
aroused most interest in the United States were probably 
the KGB “active measures” designed to discredit the 
long-serving Director of the FBI, J. Edgar Hoover, and 
the great civil rights leader Martin Luther King. The KGB 
was among the first to spread stories that Hoover was a 
predatory homosexual. King, whom the KGB feared 
might avert the race war it hoped would be ignited by the 
long hot summers which began in 1965, was probably the 
only American to be the target of both KGB and FBI 
active measures. 

The topic in The Mitrokhin Archive (published in the 
USA as The Sword and the Shield) which attracted most 
attention in Congress concerned KGB preparations for 
sabotage operations against American targets during the 
Cold War. On October 26, 1999, I gave televised 
testimony on these preparations to a packed hearing of the 
House of Representatives Armed Services Committee. 
Mitrokhin’ s material identifies the approximate locations 
of a number of the secret sites in the United States 
selected for KGB arms and radio caches for use in 
sabotage operations. On present evidence, it is impossible 
to estimate the number of these caches which were put in 
place. However, the former KGB general Oleg Kalugin, 
who was stationed in New York and Washington during 



the 1960s and early 1970s, has confirmed the existence of 
some KGB arms caches in the United States.- As in 
Europe, some caches were probably booby-trapped and 
may now be in a dangerous condition. For reasons of 
public safety. The Mitrokhin Archive gave no clues to the 
location of any of the American sites selected for KGB 
arms caches. ABC TV News, however, revealed that one 
of the sites is located in the region of Brainerd, 
Minnesota.— Later press reports, citing “congressional 
sources,” claimed that the FBI had carried out a search of 
the Brainerd area.— 

In western Europe, The Mitrokhin Archive generated 
more front-page stories in Italy than it did even in Britain 
- though almost all the stories, unsurprisingly, were on 
Italian topics. In October 1999 an Italian parliamentary 
committee released 645 pages of reports (codenamed 
IMPEDIAN) on the Italians mentioned in the Mitrokhin 
archive which had been supplied several years earlier by 
SIS to Italian intelligence. Most KGB contacts were 
identified in the reports by name as well as codename. 
The Italian Foreign Ministry was said to be investigating 
the cases of thirty employees referred to in Mitrokhin ’s 
notes. Much of the furore aroused by The Mitrokhin 
Archive in Italy, however, consisted of a revival of Cold 
War points-scoring which produced more political heat 
than historical light. Opponents of the government headed 
by the former Communist Massimo D’Alema seized on 


the references to Armando Cossutta, leader of the 
Communist PDCI which was represented in D’Alema’s 
coalition government. The Left retaliated by pointing to 
the identification in an IMPEDIAN report of a senator of 
the right-wing Forza Italia. The debate became further 
confused by conspiracy theorists on both right and left. A 
cartoon in La Repubblica, which D’Alema denounced as 
libellous, showed him blanking out a series of 
(presumably left-wing) names from the IMPEDIAN 
reports before their release. L 'Unitd, by contrast, claimed 
that left-wing ministers were increasingly convinced that
the reports were the result of a plot by MI5 (which it 
apparently confused with SIS): “What has arrived is not a 
dossier from the KGB but one about the KGB constructed 
by British counter-espionage agents based on the 
confession of an ex-agent, if there is one, and ‘Mitrokhin’ 
is just a codename for an MI5 operation.”— 

The political controversy provoked in Britain by the 
publication of The Mitrokhin Archive centred chiefly on 
the behaviour of ministers and the intelligence 
community. Why, it was asked, had Melita Norwood not 
been prosecuted when her treachery had been known at 
least since Mitrokhin’s defection in 1992? And why had 
ministers not been better briefed about her and other 
traitors identified in the Mitrokhin archive by the 
intelligence and security agencies? It emerged, to my 
surprise, that I had known about the Norwood case for 
considerably longer than either the Home Secretary or the 


Prime Minister. Jack Straw was informed in December 
1998 that Mitrokhin’s information might lead to the 
prosecution of “an 86-year-old woman who spied for the 
KGB forty years ago,” but was not told her identity until 
some months later. Tony Blair was not briefed about Mrs. 
Norwood until shortly before her name appeared on the 
front page of The Times.— 

The failure to prosecute Mrs. Norwood combined with 
the delays in briefing ministers aroused deep suspicion in 
some of the media. The Express denounced “an appalling 
culture of cover-ups and incompetence in Britain’s secret 
services.” The Guardian suspected an MI5 plot: 

We need to know whether Melita Norwood made 
a deal with the security services. Remember Blunt.— 
Was the decision not to prosecute her based on 
compassion, or a desire to cover up security service 
incompetence? 

Less than a decade earlier there would have been no 
mechanism for investigating these charges capable of 
inspiring public and parliamentary confidence. Until 1992 
successive British governments refused even to admit 
SIS’s existence on the extraordinary, though traditional, 
grounds that such an admission would put national 
security at risk. Had SIS still been officially taboo seven 
years later, no official inquiry could possibly have 
produced a credible public report on the handling of the 


Mitrokhin archive. In 1999, however, there was an 
obvious body to conduct an inquiry: the Intelligence and 
Security Committee (ISC), established under the 
Intelligence Services Act of 1994 to examine “the 
expenditure, administration and policy” of the intelligence 
and security agencies. 

Since it began work in 1994, the ISC has been a largely 
unsung success story.— Though not technically a 
parliamentary committee, since it reports to Parliament 
only through the Prime Minister, eight of its nine 
members are MPs. (The ninth is a member of the House 
of Lords.) Under the chairmanship of the former 
Conservative Defense Secretary, Tom King, its 
membership spans the political spectrum. Its founder 
members included Dale Campbell-Savours, previously a 
leading Labour critic of the intelligence community, who 
still serves on it. Largely because its members have failed 
either to divide on party lines and fall out among 
themselves or to find evidence of major intelligence 
abuses, the ISC has attracted relatively little media 
attention. Its generally positive reports on the 
performance of the intelligence community, however, 
have inevitably been dismissed by some conspiracy 
theorists as evidence of a cover-up. 

On Monday, September 13, 1999, only two days after 
The Times had begun serialization of The Mitrokhin 
Archive, Jack Straw announced in a statement to the 
Commons that the ISC had been asked to conduct an 


inquiry into “the policies and procedures adopted within 
the Security and Intelligence Agencies for the handling of 
the information supplied by Mr Mitrokhin.” Over the next 
nine months the ISC heard evidence from Jack Straw, 
Robin Cook and four former Conservative ministers, from 
the heads and other senior officers of MI5 and SIS, from 
the previous head of MI5, and from the Cabinet Secretary, 
Permanent Under Secretaries at the Home and Foreign 
Offices and other officials. Among the final witnesses 
were Mitrokhin and myself, who gave evidence to the ISC 
in the Cabinet Office at 70 Whitehall one after the other 
on the morning of March 8, 2000. While writing The 
Mitrokhin Archive, I had wrongly assumed that the 
Committee had been informed about the project. Some of 
the confusion which followed publication might well have 
been avoided if the ISC had been properly briefed well 
beforehand. 

The ISC report in June 2000 identified a series of 
administrative errors which, as usual in Whitehall, had 
more to do with cock-up than with conspiracy. The first 
“serious failure” identified by the ISC was the failure of 
the Security Service to refer the case of Mrs. Norwood to 
the Law Officers in 1993: 

This failure... resulted in the decision whether or 
not to prosecute Mrs. Norwood effectively being 
taken by the Security Service. The Committee is 
concerned that the Service used public interest 



reasons to justify taking no further action against 
Mrs. Norwood, when this was for the Law Officers 
to decide. We also believe that the failure of the 
Security Service to interview Mrs. Norwood at this 
time prevented her possible prosecution. 

For the next five years, owing to “a further serious 
failure by the Security Service,” the Norwood case 
“slipped out of sight.”— MI5 may not deserve a great deal 
of sympathy for its oversight, but it does deserve some. 
The first priority of any security service are actual, 
followed by potential, threats. Among the mass of 
material provided by Mitrokhin in 1992, the case of the 
eighty-year-old Mrs. Norwood, who had last been in 
contact with the KGB over a decade earlier and no longer 
posed any conceivable danger to national security, must 
have seemed a very low priority - particularly given the 
strain on MI5’s resources caused by cutbacks at the end of 
the Cold War and the threat from Irish terrorist groups. 

Arguably, however, MI5 underestimated Mrs. 
Norwood’s past importance. In evidence to the ISC, the 
Security Service concluded that her “value as an atom spy 
to the scientists who constructed the Soviet bomb must 
have been, at most, marginal.”— That was not the view of 
the NKGB (as the KGB was then known) in the final 
months of the Second World War. In March 1945 it 
described the atomic intelligence she had provided as “of 
great interest and a valuable contribution to the 


development of work in this field.”— Though Mrs. 
Norwood was not, of course, an atom spy in the same 
class as Ted Hall and Klaus Fuchs, both of whom 
provided intelligence from inside the main nuclear 
laboratory at Los Alamos, the NKGB and the Soviet 
scientists with whom it was in close touch plainly 
regarded her intelligence as somewhat better than 
“marginal.” The intelligence she was able to provide on 
uranium fuel cladding and post-irradiation corrosion 
resistance was probably applicable to weapons 
development as well as to the construction of nuclear 
reactors.— Until the final months of the War, the NKGB 
rated the atomic intelligence obtained in Britain almost as 
highly as that from the United States.— 

As Jack Straw told the Commons when announcing the 
ISC inquiry, “There is no reason to doubt... that the KGB 
regarded Mrs. Norwood as an important spy.” Nor is there 
reason to doubt that she was both the KGB’s longest- 
serving British agent and its most important female 
British spy. From early in her career, the KGB had high 
expectations of her. It maintained contact with her in 
1938-39 at a time when the shortage of foreign 
intelligence officers, many of whom were executed during 
the Terror, led it to lose touch with many other agents - 
including some of the Magnificent Five. Since the 
publication of The Mitrokhin Archive, Viktor Oshchenko, 
a former senior officer in the KGB scientific and 


technological intelligence (S&T) directorate, has kindly 
given me his recollections of the Norwood case. While 
stationed at the London residency in 1975, Oshchenko 
recruited Michael Smith, the KGB’s most important 
British S&T agent during the later Cold War.— He 
remembers Mrs. Norwood’s career as a Soviet agent as “a 
legendary case in the annals of the KGB - an important, 
determined and very valuable agent,” and was deeply 
impressed both by her ideological commitment and by her 
remarkable access to her boss’s papers. Among the 
intelligence which Oshchenko believes Mrs. Norwood 
supplied were “valuable papers relating to the materials 
involved in missile production.”— Details of the use made 
of Mrs. Norwood’s intelligence within the Soviet Union, 
however, remain scarce. Mitrokhin’s notes from her file, 
though giving precise information on Mrs. Norwood’s 
controllers and other operational matters, give little 
indication of the doubtless complex intelligence she 
supplied in the course of her long career as a Soviet agent. 
It is highly unlikely that the SVR will reveal any details 
of this intelligence until after Mrs. Norwood’s death. 

As well as criticizing MI5 for allowing the Norwood 
case to “slip out of sight,” the ISC also considered it “a 
serious failure of the Security Service not to refer Mr. 
Symonds’ case to the Law Officers in mid- 1993.” This 
too was plainly the result of cock-up rather than 
conspiracy - probably somewhere in MI5’s middle 
management. Even the Director-General of the Security 


Service from 1992 to 1996, Stella Rimington, was not 
informed by her staff of either the Norwood or the 
Symonds case, and was thus unable to brief Michael 
Howard, Home Secretary in the Major government, and 
his Permanent Under Secretary. Further confusion arose 
as a result of the fact that the “interdepartmental working 
group” in Whitehall responsible for monitoring the 
progress of the publication project was itself “unaware of 
the significance of [Mitrokhin’s] UK material until late 
1998.”— My own direct contact with the working group 
was limited to an enjoyable lunch with its Chairman 
shortly before Christmas 1998. I was asked, when giving 
evidence to the ISC, whether, while writing The 
Mitrokhin Archive, I would have liked greater contact 
with the group. I would indeed. 

The ISC’s Mitrokhin inquiry found much to praise as 
well as criticize: 

Carrying the initial contact with Mr. Mitrokhin 
right through to his and his family’s successful 
exfiltration together with all his material represents a 
major achievement by SIS. In addition the 
management of the material and its dissemination, as 
appropriate, to foreign liaison [intelligence] services 
was well handled. The Committee wish to pay 
tribute to this outstanding piece of intelligence 
work.— 


I was heartened by the ISC’s endorsement of the 1996 
decision to authorize me to write The Mitrokhin Archive 
in collaboration with Mitrokhin, as well as by the 
Committee’s conclusion (which I hope it is not too 
immodest to quote) that the book is “of tremendous value, 
as it gives a real insight into the KGB’s work and the 
persecution of the dissidents.”— The ISC’s greatest praise 
was, quite rightly, reserved for Vasili Mitrokhin: 

The Committee believes that he is a man of 
remarkable commitment and courage, who risked 
imprisonment or death in his determination that the 
truth should be told about the real nature of the KGB 
and their activities, which he believed were betraying 
the interests of his own country and people. He 
succeeded in this, and we wish to record formally 
our admiration for his achievement. 

The ISC report regrets that “poor media handling 
[presumably by Whitehall] of the publication of The 
Mitrokhin Archive, which allowed the emphasis to fall on 
the UK spies, detracted from the brave work of Mr. 
Mitrokhin and the importance of the revelations about the 
KGB’s work he wanted to expose.”— In the initial media 
coverage, there was little mention of the fact that vastly 
more of the book is devoted to the KGB’s war against the 
dissidents and its attempts to stifle dissent throughout the 
Soviet Bloc than to the careers of Melita Norwood and 


John Symonds. 

The chief problem in understanding both Mitrokhin and 
his archive, which was evident in much of the media 
coverage, is that neither is truly comprehensible in 
Western terms. The very notion of the hero, familiar to all 
other cultures and all previous Western generations, 
arouses greater scepticism in the early twenty- first century 
West than at any other time or place in recorded history. 
For those whose imaginations have been corroded by the 
cynicism of the age, the idea that Mitrokhin was willing 
to risk his life for twenty years for a cause in which he 
passionately believed is almost too difficult to grasp. 
Almost equally hard to comprehend is Mitrokhin’ s 
willingness to devote himself throughout that period to 
compiling and preserving a secret archive which he knew 
might never see the light of day. For any Western author 
it is almost impossible to understand how a writer could 
devote all his or her energy and creative talent for many 
years to secret writing which might never be publicly 
revealed. Yet, as Chapter 1 seeks to show, some of the 
greatest Russian writers of the Soviet era did precisely 
that.— No biography of any Western writer contains any 
death-bed scene comparable to the description by the 
widow of Mikhail Bulgakov of how she helped him out of 
bed for the last time so that he could satisfy himself 
before he died that his great, unpublished masterpiece. 
The Master and Margarita, arguably the greatest novel of 
the twentieth century, was still in its hiding place. The 


Master and Margarita survived to be published a quarter 
of a century later. It is a sobering thought, however, that 
for every forbidden masterpiece of the Soviet era which 
survives, there must be a larger number which have failed 
to survive or which, even now, are mouldering in their 
forgotten hiding places - as the Mitrokhin archive might 
well have done if Mitrokhin and SIS had not succeeded in 
removing it to Britain. 

The Mitrokhin archive is no more comprehensible in 
purely Western terms than Mitrokhin himself. The 
commonest error in interpreting the KGB is to suppose 
that it was roughly equivalent to its main Western rivals. 
There were, of course, similarities in the operational 
techniques employed by intelligence agencies in East and 
West, as well as in the importance which each side 
attached to the other as an intelligence target. The 
fundamental difference between the Soviet one-party state 
and the Western democracies, however, was reflected in 
fundamental differences between their intelligence 
communities. 

The differences were greatest in the Stalinist era. At the 
outbreak of the Second World War, Stalin regarded the 
NKVD’s pursuit in Mexico of the great, though harmless, 
heretic, Leon Trotsky, as a higher priority than collecting 
intelligence on Adolf Hitler. In the middle of the War, the 
paranoid strain which regularly distorted Soviet 
intelligence assessment persuaded Soviet intelligence 
chiefs - and no doubt Stalin himself - that the 



Magnificent Five, probably its ablest group of foreign 
agents, were part of a gigantic British intelligence 
deception. During his final years Stalin was sometimes 
obsessed with the hunting down of often imaginary 
Titoists and Zionists. His chief foreign policy objective at 
the end of his life may well have been the plan for an 
MGB (later KGB) illegal to assassinate Marshal Tito, 
who had succeeded Trotsky as the leading heretic of the 
Soviet Bloc. Stalin once called Lavrenti Beria, the most 
powerful of his intelligence chiefs, “my Himmler.” But 
there was no Western intelligence chief with whom Beria 
- or Himmler, the head of the SS - could be credibly 
compared. 

Even after Stalin’s death and Beria’ s execution in 1953, 
there remained basic differences between intelligence 
priorities in East and West. Perhaps the simplest way of 
judging whether any intelligence report is of critical 
importance is to ask the question: If it arrives in the 
middle of the night would you wake the relevant 
government minister? The answer to that question in 
Moscow was often quite different from that in Western 
capitals. On October 27, 1978, for example, the KGB 
resident in Oslo, Leonid Makarov, rang Mikhail Suslov, 
the member of the Politburo chiefly responsible for 
ideological purity, in the early hours. Why? Not to tell 
him that some great international crisis was about to break 
but to report that the Russian dissident Yuri Orlov had 
failed to win the Nobel Peace Prize. The Oslo residency 



was warmly congratulated for its supposed “operational 
effectiveness” in achieving this entirely predictable 
result.— It is simply not possible to imagine any Western 
minister being woken for any comparable reason. 

The KGB’s domestic obsession with the detection and 
suppression of “ideological subversion” spilled over into 
its foreign operations. It sought to impress the Party 
leadership by its zeal in discrediting dissidents abroad as 
well as at home. In the summer of 1978 the KGB First 
Chief (Foreign Intelligence) and Fifth (Ideological 
Subversion) Directorates jointly arranged the secret 
screening in Moscow to an audience of KGB and Party 
notables of the commencement address by the dissident 
writer Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn at Harvard University. The 
purpose of this extraordinary (by Western standards) 
evening was to seek to demonstrate that, thanks to the 
efforts of the KGB, Solzhenitsyn was now a largely 
discredited figure in the United States.— The KGB’s 
mission to discredit dissidents who had emigrated to the 
West extended even to dissident ballet dancers, musicians 
and chess players. 

For Western media used to interpreting the secret Cold 
War in terms of spy versus spy, Mitrokhin’s material on 
the KGB’s war against ideological subversion, unlike the 
revelations about individual spies, had little interest. 
There was, predictably, greater interest in this material in 
the countries of the former Soviet Bloc - reflected, for 
example, in the number of translations of The Mitrokhin 


Archive into Eastern European languages. The priority 
given by the KGB to maintaining the ideological 
orthodoxy of the Soviet Bloc was reflected by the fact that 
it deployed more of its elite group of illegals to 
Czechoslovakia during the Prague Spring of 1968 than, so 
far as is known, were ever used in any operation against a 
Western target. 

The Cold War chapters of The Mitrokhin Archive give 
equal weight to KGB operations against the United States 
and to those against ideological subversion. Mitrokhin 
smuggled out of the KGB foreign intelligence 
headquarters important material on operations against 
some of the leaders of the struggle for democracy within 
the Soviet Bloc whose extraordinary moral courage 
eventually prevailed over the immense coercive force of 
the KGB and its allies. Two examples stand out. The first 
is the great Russian dissident and nuclear scientist Andrei 
Sakharov, dubbed “Public Enemy Number One” by Yuri 
Andropov (successively KGB Chairman and Soviet 
leader), who survived persecution and internal exile by 
the KGB to become, in Gorbachev’s words, 
“unquestionably the most outstanding personality” at the 
1989 Congress of People’s Soviets. One of the most 
striking visual images of the crumbling of the Soviet 
system, which deserves to be as well known as the 
destruction of the Berlin Wall, is of Gorbachev and other 
members of the Politburo standing bareheaded by 
Sakharov’s open coffin after his sudden death in 



December 1989. 

The second outstanding case is that of Cardinal Karol 
Wojtyla, Archbishop of Krakow, whom the KGB seems 
to have identified in the early 1970s as its most dangerous 
opponent in the Soviet Bloc. Wojtyla, however, was 
protected by his moral authority and eminence. The KGB, 
like the Polish SB, shrank from the immense public 
outcry which his arrest would provoke. Seen in hindsight, 
Wojtyla’ s election in 1978 as Pope John Paul II marked 
the beginning of the end of the Soviet Bloc. Though the 
Polish problem was, with difficulty, contained for the next 
decade, it could not be resolved. 

The organization which has studied The Mitrokhin 
Archive with the closest attention since its publication is 
the SVR, which is deeply concerned by its contents. No 
intelligence agency can expect either to recruit new agents 
or to maintain the loyalty of its existing agents unless it 
can convince them that it can keep their secrets 
indefinitely. The SVR is now ill-placed to do so. Thanks 
to Mitrokhin, no one who spied for the Soviet Union at 
any period between the October Revolution and the eve of 
the Gorbachev era can now be confident that his or her 
secrets are still secure. Mitrokhin’ s material also contains 
information on Cold War operations conducted by the 
current head of the SVR, Vyacheslav Trubnikov, and 
other former senior KGB officers. Volume Two will 
contain a chapter on KGB activities in India, where 
Trubnikov made his reputation. If the past secrets of the 



SVR leadership have proved insecure, SVR agents may 
well conclude that theirs are also. 

From the moment the Mitrokhin archive arrived in 
Britain, SIS realized that its contents were “of exceptional 
counter-intelligence significance, not only illuminating 
past KGB activity against Western countries but also 
promising to nullify many of Russia’s current assets.” The 
CIA similarly found the archive “the biggest Cl [counter- 
intelligence] bonanza of the post-war period.” The FBI 
agreed. As the ISC report reveals, other Western 
intelligence agencies have also been “extremely grateful” 
for the numerous Cl leads provided by the Mitrokhin 
archive.— 

Some insight into the turmoil inside the SVR which 
must have been provoked by the publication of The 
Mitrokhin Archive is provided by the file (noted by 
Mitrokhin) on the book on the KGB published by the 
American journalist John Barron a quarter of a century 
ago. KGB headquarters ordered no fewer than 370 reports 
in an attempt to assess the damage to its interests caused 
by various sections of Barron’s book.— Mitrokhin’ s 
revelations have doubtless led to even more damage 
assessments than Barron’s. There is already unattributable 
evidence of efforts by the SVR to ensure that no archivist 
ever again has the unrestricted access to files enjoyed by 
Mitrokhin. 

Like the KGB First Chief Directorate, the SVR 
contains an “active measures” section. Department MS, 


specializing in disinformation, which was inevitably 
instructed to try to undermine the credibility of The 
Mitrokhin Archive?^ On two occasions since the 
publication of the book, it has sent apparent Russian 
defectors to Western intelligence agencies, each with the 
same story about The Mitrokhin Archive. The SVR, 
claimed the “defectors,” had decided on a massive clear- 
out of redundant and retired agents which it had inherited 
from the KGB, and had therefore chosen a retired KGB 
archivist - Vasili Mitrokhin - to transmit their names to 
the West.— This poorly conceived active measure proved 
counter-productive for two reasons. First, a series of 
Western intelligence agencies had already been able to 
establish that Mitrokhin ’s material was far too valuable to 
them for the SVR to have willingly made it available. 
Secondly, both the bogus “defectors” were quickly and 
conclusively exposed as SVR plants. The whole episode 
has merely served to underline the SVR’s deep anxiety at 
the damage to its agent operations caused by Mitrokhin’ s 
material. Its mood will not have been lightened by the 
knowledge that there are many more revelations still to 
come in Volume Two. Mitrokhin’ s ambition - unchanged 
for almost thirty years - remains to publish as much as 
possible of the top-secret material which he risked his life 
to collect. 


NOTES 


1 By the time I gained access to the archive, the greater 
part had been translated and carefully checked by SIS 
officers working in close collaboration with Mitrokhin. 
The Security Service and US intelligence officers also 
assisted in the translation. The translated archive was 
made available to me in an SIS office both in hard copy 
and on a computer database with sophisticated indexing 
and search software. While I was writing the book, 
Mitrokhin worked three days a week with an SIS officer 
completing the translation and checking process.

14 In 1963, after a long investigation had failed to find 
enough usable evidence to secure a conviction, the Soviet 


spy Sir Anthony Blunt had been offered immunity from 
prosecution in return for a full confession (not a bargain 
he seems to have completely honoured). It was later 
alleged, on no adequate evidence, that the real reason for 
the decision not to prosecute had been an establishment or 
MI5 coverup. 

15 In stating this conclusion, I should perhaps declare an 
interest. Since the late 1970s I had argued the case for the 
establishment of a parliamentary intelligence committee 
with roughly the role of the present Intelligence and 
Security Committee. (See, for example, the introduction 
to Andrew and Dilks [eds.]. Missing Dimension, and the 
conclusion to Andrew, Secret Service.) The proposal was 
initially given a frosty reception in Whitehall.

18 See below, p. 168. It is difficult to see how Mrs. 
Norwood could have provided atomic intelligence of such 
“great value” in March 1945 if, as claimed by Phillip 
Knightley, she did not return to work in the British Non- 
Ferrous Metals Research Association (BN-FMRA) after 
extended maternity leave until 1946 (Knightley, 
“Norwood: the spy who never was,” New Statesman, 
December 13, 1999). MI5 evidence to the ISC confirms 
that in 1945 Mrs. Norwood was secretary to the Chairman 
of the BN-FMRA (Intelligence and Security Committee, 


The Mitrokhin Inquiry Report, p. 67). 

19 This is the view of a government scientist who prefers 
not to be identified. Precise details of the atomic 
intelligence provided by Mrs. Norwood are unavailable. 
Not until they have been carefully analyzed and compared 
with the other atomic intelligence obtained by Soviet 
intelligence will it be possible to form a final judgement 
on the importance of her role as an atom spy. Atomic 
intelligence provided by Mrs. Norwood after 1945 was 
irrelevant to the construction of the Soviet bomb which, 
thanks chiefly to Hall and Fuchs, was an exact replica of 
the American - not the British - bomb. It remained, 
however, of some significance. Probably the most 
important secret in post-war Britain - a secret so sensitive 
that Prime Minister Clement Attlee withheld it from most 
of his cabinet - concerned the construction of the British 
atomic bomb. Mrs. Norwood’s intelligence must have 
provided some insight into the highly classified progress 
of British atomic scientists. (See below, pp. 518-19.) 

20 According to a file noted by Mitrokhin (vol. 7, ch. 2, 
item 19), up to November 1944 the NKGB obtained 1,167 
documents on “nuclear secrets” from the USA and UK. 

Of these 88 from the USA and 79 from the UK were rated 
as “very valuable.” Mitrokhin’ s notes contain no similar 
statistics for the period after November 1944. Further 
atomic intelligence was received from the GRU.

32 The KGB had similarly sought to discredit Andrew 
and Gordievsky, KGB: The Inside Story, after its 
publication in 1990, by claiming that its best-publicized 
revelation - the identification of John Cairncross as the 
“Fifth Man” and the first agent to provide warning of 
plans to build the atomic bomb - was wrong. The SVR 
now acknowledges that the identification was correct on 
both counts. 

33 In devising this ill-advised active measure. Department 
MS may have been encouraged by the fact that two 
somewhat similar suggestions had surfaced independently 


in the Western media. A writer in Le Monde had 
suggested that “...The Mitrokhin archive operation was 
organized in Moscow either by an undisciplined Stalinist 
faction in the KGB or by the provisional leadership of the 
[intelligence] agencies between November 1991 and 
February 1992.” (“Voyages en memoire sovietique,” Le 
Monde, November 5, 1999.) In her review of The 
Mitrokhin Archive in The Times Literary Supplement 
(November 26, 1999), Dr. Amy Knight also could not 
“help but wonder whether [Mitrokhin] had a little help 
from his former employers in making known the KGB’s 
archival secrets.” “This,” she added, “is by no means a 
farfetched suggestion.” Dr. Knight’s earlier review of my 
book with Oleg Gordlevsky, KGB: The Inside Story, had 
included the eccentric suggestion that I might not have 
written the lengthy introduction {TLS, December 7, 1990). 
My own review of Dr. Knight’s book. Spies Without 
Cloaks, makes clear my respect for her research on 
Russian intelligence. There is, however, occasionally a 
mild element of conspiracy theory in her work - as 
evidenced, for example, by her suggestion in Spies 
Without Cloaks that Gorbachev was complicit in the 
attempted coup against him in August 1991. 



ONE 


THE MITROKHIN ARCHIVE 


This book is based on unprecedented and unrestricted 
access to one of the world’s most secret and closely 
guarded archives — that of the foreign intelligence arm of 
the KGB, the First Chief Directorate (FCD). Hitherto the 
present Russian foreign intelligence service, the SVR 
(Sluzhba Vneshnei Razvedki), has been supremely 
confident that a book such as this could not be written. 
When the German magazine Focus reported in December 
1996 that a former KGB officer had defected to Britain 
with “the names of hundreds of Russian spies,” Tatyana 
Samolis, spokeswoman for the SVR, instantly ridiculed 
the whole story as “absolute nonsense.” “Hundreds of 
people! That just doesn’t happen!” she declared. “Any 
defector could get the name of one, two, perhaps three 
agents — but not hundreds!”^ 

The facts, however, are far more sensational even than 
the story dismissed as impossible by the SVR. The KGB 
defector had brought with him to Britain details not of a 
few hundred but of thousands of Soviet agents and 
intelligence officers in all parts of the globe, some of them 



“illegals” living under deep cover abroad, disguised as 
foreign citizens. No one who spied for the Soviet Union at 
any period between the October Revolution and the eve of 
the Gorbachev era can now be confident that his or her 
secrets are still secure. When the British Secret 
Intelligence Service (SIS) exfiltrated the defector and his 
family from Russia in 1992, it also brought out six cases 
containing the copious notes he had taken almost daily for 
twelve years, before his retirement in 1984, on top secret 
KGB files going as far back as 1918. The contents of the 
cases have since been described by the American FBI as 
“the most complete and extensive intelligence ever 
received from any source.” 

The KGB officer who assembled this extraordinary 
archive, Vasili Nikitich Mitrokhin, is now a British 
citizen. Bom in central Russia in 1922, he began his 
career as a Soviet foreign intelligence officer in 1948, at a 
time when the foreign intelligence arms of the MGB (the 
future KGB) and the GRU (Soviet military intelligence) 
were temporarily combined in the Committee of 
Information.^ By the time Mitrokhin was sent on his first 
foreign posting in 1952,^ the Committee had disintegrated 
and the MGB had resumed its traditional rivalry with the 
GRU. His first five years in intelligence were spent in the 
paranoid atmosphere generated by the final phase of 
Stalin’s dictatorship, when the intelligence agencies were 
ordered to conduct witch-hunts throughout the Soviet 
Bloc against mostly imaginary Titoist and Zionist 



conspiracies. 

In January 1953 the MGB was officially accused of 
“lack of vigilance” in hunting down the conspirators. The 
Soviet news agency Tass made the sensational 
announcement that for the past few years world Zionism 
and Western intelligence agencies had been conspiring 
with “a terrorist group” of Jewish doctors “to wipe out the 
leadership of the Soviet Union.” During the final two 
months of Stalin’s rule, the MGB struggled to 
demonstrate its heightened vigilance by pursuing the 
perpetrators of this non-existent plot. Its anti-Zionist 
campaign was, in reality, little more than a thinly 
disguised anti-Semitic pogrom. Shortly before Stalin’s 
sudden death in March 1953, Mitrokhin was ordered to 
investigate the alleged Zionist connections of the Pravda 
correspondent in Paris, Yuri Zhukov, who had come 
under suspicion because of his wife’s Jewish origins. 
Mitrokhin had the impression that Stalin’s brutal security 
supremo, Lavrenti Pavlovich Beria, was planning to 
implicate Zhukov in the supposed Jewish doctors’ plot. A 
few weeks after Stalin’s funeral, however, Beria suddenly 
announced that the plot had never existed, and exonerated 
the alleged conspirators. 

By the summer of 1953 most of Beria’ s colleagues in 
the Presidium were united in their fear of another 
conspiracy — that he might be planning a coup d'etat to 
step into Stalin’s shoes. While visiting a foreign capital in 
July, Mitrokhin received a top secret telegram with 



instructions to decipher it himself, and was astonished to 
discover that Beria had been charged with “criminal anti- 
Party and anti-state activities.” Only later did Mitrokhin 
learn that Beria had been arrested at a special meeting of 
the Presidium on June 26 after a plot organized by his 
chief rival, Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev. From his 
prison cell, Beria wrote begging letters to his former 
colleagues, pleading pathetically for them to spare his life 
and “find the smallest job for me”: 

You will see that in two or three years I’ll have 
straightened out fine and will still be useful to you... 

I ask the comrades to forgive me for writing 
somewhat disjointedly and badly because of my 
condition, and also because of the poor lighting and 
not having my pince-nez. 

No longer in awe of him, the comrades simply mocked 
his loss of nerve. 

On December 24 it was announced that Beria had been 
executed after trial by the Supreme Court. Since neither 
his responsibility for mass murder in the Stalin era nor his 
own record as a serial rapist of under-age girls could be 
publicly mentioned for fear of bringing the Communist 
regime into disrepute, he was declared guilty instead of a 
surreal plot “to revive capitalism and to restore the rule of 
the bourgeoisie” in association with British and other 
Western intelligence services. Beria thus became. 



following Yagoda and Yezhov in the 1930s, the third 
Soviet security chief to be shot for crimes which included 
serving as an (imaginary) British secret agent. In true 
Stalinist tradition, subscribers to the Great Soviet 
Encyclopedia were advised to use “a small knife or razor 
blade” to remove the entry on Beria, and then to insert a 
replacement article on the Bering Sea.^ 

The first official repudiation of Stalinism was 
Khrushchev’s now-celebrated secret speech to a closed 
session of the Twentieth Congress of the Communist 
Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) in February 1956. 
Stalin’s “cult of personality,” Khrushchev declared, had 
been responsible for “a whole series of exceedingly 
serious and grave perversions of Party principles, of Party 
democracy, of revolutionary legality.” The speech was 
reported to the KGB Party organization in a secret letter 
from the Central Committee. The section to which 
Mitrokhin belonged took two days to debate its contents. 
He still vividly recalls the conclusion of the section’s 
chairman, Vladimir Vasilyevich Zhenikhov (later KGB 
resident in Finland): “Stalin was a bandit!” Some Party 
members were too shocked — or cautious — to say 
anything. Others agreed with Zhenikhov. None dared ask 
the question which Mitrokhin was convinced was in all 
their minds: “Where was Khrushchev while all these 
crimes were taking place?” 

In the aftermath of the secret speech Mitrokhin became 
too outspoken for his own good. Though his criticisms of 



the way the KGB had been run were mild by Western 
standards, late in 1956 Mitrokhin was moved from 
operations to the FCD archives, where his main job was 
answering queries from other departments and provincial 
KGBs.^ Mitrokhin discovered that Beria’s personal 
archive had been destroyed on Khrushchev’s orders so as 
to leave no trace of the compromising material he had 
collected on his former colleagues. Ivan Aleksandrovich 
Serov, chairman of the KGB from 1954 to 1958, dutifully 
reported to Khrushchev that the files had contained much 
“provocative and libelous” material.^ 

Mitrokhin was an avid reader of the Russian writers 
who had fallen out of favor in the final years of Stalinist 
rule and began to be published again during the mid- 
1950s. The first great literary event in Moscow after 
Stalin’s death was the publication in 1954, for the first 
time since 1945, of new poems by Boris Pasternak, the 
last leading Russian author to have begun his career 
before the Revolution. Published in a literary magazine 
under the title “Poems from the Novel Doctor Zhivago T 
they were accompanied by a brief description of the epic 
but still unfinished work in which they were to appear. 
However, the completed text of Doctor Zhivago, which 
followed the meandering life of its enigmatic hero from 
the final phase of Tsarist rule to the early years of the 
Soviet regime, was judged far too subversive for 
publication and was officially rejected in 1956. In the 
novel, when Zhivago hears the news of the Bolshevik 



Revolution, “He was shaken and overwhelmed by the 
greatness of the moment, and thought of its significance 
for the centuries to come.” But Pasternak goes on to 
convey an unmistakable sense of the spiritual emptiness 
of the regime which emerged from it. Lenin is “vengeance 
incarnate” and Stalin a “pockmarked Caligula.” 

Pasternak became the first Soviet author since the 
1920s to circumvent the banning of his work in Russia by 
publishing it abroad. As he handed the typescript of 
Doctor Zhivago to a representative of his Italian 
publisher, Giangiacomo Feltrinelli, he told him with a 
melancholy laugh: “You are hereby invited to watch me 
face the firing squad!” Soon afterwards, acting on official 
instructions, Pasternak sent a telegram to Feltrinelli 
insisting that his novel be withdrawn from publication; 
privately, however, he wrote a letter telling him to go 
ahead. Published first in Italian in November 1957, 
Doctor Zhivago became a bestseller in twenty-four 
languages. Some Western critics hailed it as the greatest 
Russian novel since Tolstoy’s Resurrection, published in 
1899. Official outrage in Moscow at Doctor Zhivago'^ 
success was compounded by the award to Pasternak of the 
1958 Nobel Prize for Literature. In a cable to the Swedish 
Academy, Pasternak declared himself “immensely 
thankful, touched, proud, astonished, abashed.” The 
newspaper of the Soviet Writers’ Union, the 
Literaturnaya Gazeta, however, denounced him as “a 
literary Judas who betrayed his people for thirty pieces of 



silver — the Nobel Prize.” Under immense official 
pressure, Pasternak cabled Stockholm withdrawing his 
acceptance of the prize “in view of the significance given 
to this award in the society to which I belong.”^ 

Though Pasternak was not one of his own favorite 
authors, Mitrokhin saw the official condemnation of 
Doctor Zhivago as typifying Khrushchev’s cultural 
barbarism. “The development of literature and art in a 
socialist society,” Khrushchev boorishly insisted, 
“proceeds... as directed by the Party.” Mitrokhin was so 
outraged by the neo- Stalinist denunciations of Pasternak 
by Moscow’s literary establishment that in October 1958 
he sent an anonymous letter of protest to the 
Literaturnaya Gazeta. Though he wrote the letter with his 
left hand in order to disguise his handwriting, he remained 
anxious for some time that his identity might be 
discovered. Mitrokhin knew from KGB files the immense 
resources which were frequently deployed to track down 
anonymous letter- writers. He was even worried that, by 
licking the gum on the back of the envelope before 
sealing it, he had made it possible for his saliva to be 
identified by a KGB laboratory. The whole episode 
strengthened his resentment at Khrushchev’s failure to 
follow his secret speech of 1956 by a thoroughgoing 
program of de-Stalinization. Khrushchev, he suspected, 
had personally ordered Pasternak’s persecution as a 
warning to all those inclined to challenge his authority. 

As yet, however, Mitrokhin pinned his faith not on the 



overthrow of the Soviet regime but on the emergence of a 
new leader less tainted than Khrushchev by his Stalinist 
past. When, late in 1958, Serov was replaced as KGB 
chairman by one of his leading critics, Aleksandr 
Nikolayevich Shelepin, Mitrokhin believed that the new 
leader had emerged. Aged only forty, Shelepin had made 
his reputation as a guerrilla commander during the Second 
World War. As head of the Communist Youth League 
(Komsomol) from 1952 to 1958, he had mobilized 
thousands of young people from Khrushchev’s “Virgin 
Lands” campaign to turn vast areas of steppe into arable 
farmland. Though many of the new collective farms were 
later ruined by soil erosion, in the short term the 
campaign seemed a spectacular success. Soviet newsreels 
showed endless lines of combine-harvesters as they 
advanced through prairies rippling with grain and 
stretching as far as the eye could see. 

As Mitrokhin had hoped, Shelepin rapidly established 
himself as a new broom within the KGB, replacing many 
veteran Stalinists with bright young graduates from 
Komsomol. Mitrokhin was impressed by the way that 
when Shelepin gave televised speeches, he looked briefly 
at his notes, then spoke directly to the viewer — instead of 
woodenly reading from a prepared text like most Soviet 
leaders. Shelepin sought to give the KGB a new public 
image. “Violations of socialist legality,” he claimed in 
1961, “have been completely eliminated... The Chekists 
[KGB officers] can look the Party and the Soviet people 



in the eye with a clear conscience.” Mitrokhin also 
remembers Shelepin for an act of personal kindness to a 
close relative. 

Like Beria before him and Andropov after him, 
Shelepin’ s ambitions stretched far beyond the 
chairmanship of the KGB. As a twenty-year-old 
university student, he was once asked what he wanted to 
become. According to the Russian historian Roy 
Medvedev, he instantly replied, “A chief! Shelepin saw 
the KGB as a stepping stone in a career which he intended 
to take him to the post of First Secretary of the CPSU. In 
December 1961 he left the KGB but continued to oversee 
its work as chairman of the powerful new Committee of 
Party and State Control. The new KGB chairman was 
Shelepin’ s youthful but less dynamic protege, thirty- 
seven-year-old Vladimir Yefimovich Semichastny. On 
Khrushchev’s instructions, Semichastny resumed the 
work of pruning the archives of material which too 
vividly recalled the Presidium’s Stalinist past, ordering 
the destruction of nine volumes of files on the liquidation 
of Central Committee members, senior intelligence 
officers and foreign Communists living in Moscow during 
the Stalin era.^ 

Mitrokhin continued to see Shelepin as a future First 
Secretary, and was not surprised when he became one of 
the leaders of the coup which toppled Khrushchev in 
1964. Memories of Beria, however, were still too fresh in 
the minds of most of the Presidium for them to be 



prepared to accept a security chief as Party leader. For 
most of his colleagues, Leonid Ilich Brezhnev, who had 
succeeded Khrushchev as First (later General) Secretary, 
was a far more reassuring figure — affable, lightweight 
and patient in reconciling opposing factions, though 
skillful in outmaneuvering his political rivals. By 1967 
Brezhnev felt strong enough to sack the unpopular 
Semichastny and sideline the still-ambitious Shelepin, 
who was demoted from heading the Committee of Party 
and State Control to become chairman of the 
comparatively uninfluential Trade Union Council. On 
arriving in his spacious new office, Shelepin found that 
his predecessor, Viktor Grishin, had what Medvedev later 
euphemistically described as “a specially equipped 
massage parlor” in an adjoining room. Shelepin took 
revenge for his demotion by circulating stories about 
Grishin’s sexual exploits around Moscow. 

The main beneficiary of the downfall of Semichastny 
and the sidelining of Shelepin was Yuri Vladimirovich 
Andropov, who became chairman of the KGB. Andropov 
had what some of his staff called a “Hungarian complex.” 
As Soviet ambassador in Budapest during the Hungarian 
Uprising in 1956, he had watched in horror from the 
windows of his embassy as officers of the hated 
Hungarian security service were strung up from 
lampposts. Andropov remained haunted for the rest of his 
life by the speed with which an apparently all-powerful 
Communist one-party state had begun to topple. When 



other Communist regimes later seemed at risk — in Prague 
in 1968, in Kabul in 1979, in Warsaw in 1981 — he was 
convinced that, as in Budapest in 1956, only armed force 
could ensure their survival. Since leaving Hungary in 
1957 Andropov had been head of the Central Committee 
Department responsible for relations with Communist 
parties in the Soviet Bloc. His appointment in 1967 as the 
first senior Party official brought in to head the KGB was 
intended by Brezhnev to secure political control of the 
security and intelligence systems. Andropov went on to 
become the longest-serving and most politically astute of 
all KGB chiefs, crowning his fifteen years as chairman by 
succeeding Brezhnev as General Secretary in 1982. 

THE FIRST GREAT crisis of Andropov’s years at the 
KGB was the attempt by the Czechoslovak reformers of 
the Prague Spring to create what the Kremlin saw as an 
unacceptably unorthodox “socialism with a human face.” 
Like Khrushchev’s Secret Speech, the invasion of 
Czechoslovakia by the forces of the Warsaw Pact in 
August 1968 was an important staging post in what 
Mitrokhin calls his “intellectual odyssey.” Stationed in 
East Germany during the Prague Spring, Mitrokhin was 
able to listen to reports from Czechoslovakia on the 
Russian-language services of the BBC World Service, 
Radio Liberty, Deutsche Welle and the Canadian 
Broadcasting Company, but had no one with whom he felt 
able to share his sympathy for the Prague reforms. One 



episode about a month before Soviet tanks entered Prague 
left a particular impression on him. An FCD Department 

V (“special tasks”) officer, Colonel Viktor Ryabov, said 
to Mitrokhin that he was “just off to Sweden for a few 
days,” but made clear by his expression that Sweden was 
not his real destination. A few days after Ryabov’s return, 
he told Mitrokhin there would be an interesting article in 
the following day’s Pravda, implying that it was 
connected with his mission. When Mitrokhin read the 
report the next day that an “imperialist arms dump” had 
been discovered in Czechoslovakia, he realized at once 
that it had been planted by Ryabov and other Department 

V officers to discredit the reformers. 

Soon after the crushing of the Prague Spring, Mitrokhin 
heard a speech given by Andropov in the KGB’s East 
German headquarters at Karlshorst in the Berlin suburbs. 
Like Shelepin, Andropov spoke directly to the audience, 
rather than — like most Soviet officials — sticking to a 
prepared platitudinous text. With an ascetic appearance, 
silver hair swept back over a large forehead, steel-rimmed 
glasses and an intellectual manner, Andropov seemed far 
removed from Stalinist thugs such as Beria and Serov. His 
explanation for the invasion of Czechoslovakia was far 
more sophisticated than that given to the Soviet public. It 
had, he insisted, been the only way to preserve Soviet 
security and the new European order which had emerged 
from the Great Patriotic War. That objective political 
necessity, Andropov claimed, was accepted even by such 



unorthodox figures as the great physicist Pyotr Kapitza, 
who had initially shown some sympathy for the Prague 
revisionists. Mitrokhin drew quite different conclusions 
from the Warsaw Pact invasion. The destruction of 
Czechoslovak “socialism with a human face” proved, he 
believed, that the Soviet system was unreformable. He 
still vividly recalls a curiously mythological image, which 
henceforth he saw increasingly in his mind’s eye, of the 
Russian people in thrall to “a three-headed hydra”: the 
Communist Party, the privileged nomenklatura and the 
KGB. 

After his return to Moscow from East Germany, 
Mitrokhin continued to listen to Western broadcasts, 
although, because of Soviet jamming, he had frequently to 
switch wavelengths in order to find an audible station. 
Often he ended up with only fragments of news stories. 
Among the news which made the greatest impression on 
him were items on the Chronicle of Current Events, a 
samizdat journal first produced by Soviet dissidents in 
1968 to circulate news on the struggle against abuses of 
human rights. The Chronicle carried on its masthead the 
guarantee of freedom of expression in the United Nations 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, daily abused in 
the Soviet Union. 

As the struggle against “ideological subversion” 
intensified, Mitrokhin saw numerous examples of the way 
in which the KGB manipulated, virtually at will, the 
Soviet justice system. He later copied down the 



sycophantic congratulations sent to Andropov by A. F. 
Gorkhin, chairman of the Soviet Supreme Court, on the 
fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the Cheka in 
December 1967: 

The Soviet Courts and the USSR Committee of State 
Security [KGB] are of the same age. But this is not 
the main thing which brings us together; the main 
thing is the identity of our tasks ... 

We are glad to note that the State Security 
agencies and the Courts solve all their complicated 
tasks in a spirit of mutual understanding and sound 
professional relations. 

Mitrokhin saw mounting evidence both in the classified 
in-house journal, KGB Sbornik, and in FCD files of 
Andropov’s personal obsession with the destruction of 
dissent in all its forms and his insistence that the struggle 
for human rights was part of a wide-ranging imperialist 
plot to undermine the foundations of the Soviet state. In 
1968 Andropov issued KGB Chairman’s Order No. 0051, 
“On the tasks of State security agencies in combating 
ideological sabotage by the adversary,” calling for greater 
aggression in the struggle against both dissidents at home 
and their imperialist supporters. One example of this 
greater aggression which left Mitrokhin, as an ardent 
admirer of the Kirov Ballet, with a sense of personal 
outrage was the plan which he discovered in FCD files to 



maim the ballet’s star defector, Rudolf Nureyev.^^ 

By the beginning of the 1970s Mitrokhin’s political 
views were deeply influenced by the dissident struggle, 
which he was able to follow both in KGB records and 
Western broadcasts. “I was a loner,” he recalls, “but I now 
knew that I was not alone.” Though Mitrokhin never had 
any thought of aligning himself openly with the human 
rights movement, the example of the Chronicle of Current 
Events and other samizdat productions helped to inspire 
him with the idea of producing a classified variant of the 
dissidents’ attempts to document the iniquities of the 
Soviet system. Gradually the project began to form in his 
mind of compiling his own private record of the foreign 
operations of the KGB. 

Mitrokhin’s opportunity came in June 1972 when the 
First Chief (Foreign Intelligence) Directorate left its 
overcrowded central Moscow offices in the KGB 
headquarters at the Lubyanka (once the pre-Revolutionary 
home of the Rossiya Insurance Company) and moved to a 
new building south-east of Moscow at Yasenevo, half a 
mile beyond the outer ringroad. Designed by a Finnish 
architect, the main Y-shaped seven-story office building 
was flanked on one side by an assembly hall and library, 
on the other by a polyclinic, sports complex and 
swimming pool, with pleasant views over hills covered 
with birch trees, green pastures, and — in summer — fields 
of wheat and rye. To the other KGB directorates, most of 
which worked in cramped conditions in central Moscow, 



Yasenevo was known — ^with more envy than 

condescension — as “The Woods.” 

For the next ten years, working from private offices 
both in the Lubyanka and at Yasenevo, Mitrokhin was 
alone responsible for checking and sealing the 
approximately 300,000 files in the FCD archive prior to 
their transfer to the new headquarters. While supervising 
the checking of files, the compilation of inventories and 
the writing of index cards, Mitrokhin was able to inspect 
what files he wished in one or other of his offices. Few 
KGB officers apart from Mitrokhin have ever spent as 
much time reading, let alone noting, foreign intelligence 
files. Outside the FCD archives, only the most senior 
officers shared his unrestricted access, and none had the 
time to read more than a fraction of the material noted by 
him. 

Mitrokhin ’s usual weekly routine was to spend each 
Monday, Tuesday and Friday in his Yasenevo office. On 
Wednesdays he went to the Lubyanka to work on the 
FCD’s most secret files, those of Directorate S which ran 
illegals — KGB officers and agents, most of Soviet 
nationality, working under deep cover abroad disguised as 
foreign citizens. Once reviewed by Mitrokhin, each batch 
of files was placed in sealed containers which were 
transported to Yasenevo on Thursday mornings, 
accompanied by Mitrokhin who checked them on 
arrival. Unlike the other departments, who moved to the 
new FCD headquarters in 1972, Directorate S remained 



based in the Lubyanka for a further decade. 

Mitrokhin thus found himself spending more time 
dealing with the files of Directorate S, the most secret in 
the FCD, than with those of any other section of Soviet 
foreign intelligence. The illegals retained a curious 
mystique within the KGB. Before being posted abroad, 
every illegal officer was required to swear a solemn, if 
somewhat melodramatic, oath: 

Deeply valuing the trust placed upon me by the Party 
and the fatherland, and imbued with a sense of 
intense gratitude for the decision to send me to the 
sharp edge of the struggle for the interest of my 
people... as a worthy son of the homeland, I would 
rather perish than betray the secrets entrusted to me 
or put into the hand of the adversary materials which 
could cause political harm to the interests of the 
State. With every heartbeat, with every day that 
passes, I swear to serve the Party, the homeland, and 
the Soviet people. 

The files showed that before the Second World War the 
greatest foreign successes had been achieved by a 
legendary group of intelligence officers, often referred to 
as the “Great Illegals.” After the Second World War, the 
KGB had tried to recreate its pre-war triumphs by 
establishing an elaborate network of “illegal residencies” 
alongside the “legal residencies” which operated under 



diplomatic or other official cover in foreign capitals. 

The records of Directorate S revealed some remarkable 
individual achievements. KGB illegals successfully 
established bogus identities as foreign nationals in a great 
variety of professions ranging from Costa Rican 
ambassador to piano tuner to the Governor of New York. 
Even in the Gorbachev era, KGB propaganda continued 
to depict the Soviet illegal as the supreme embodiment of 
the chivalric ideal in the service of secret intelligence. The 
retired British KGB agent George Blake wrote in 1990: 

Only a man who believes very strongly in an ideal 
and serves a great cause will agree to embark on 
such a career, though the word “calling” is perhaps 
appropriate here. Only an intelligence service which 
works for a great cause can ask for such a sacrifice 
from its officers. That is why, as far as I know, at 
any rate in peacetime, only the Soviet intelligence 
service has “illegal residents. 

The SVR continues the KGB tradition of illegal 
hagiography. In July 1995, a month after the death of the 
best-known American-bom illegal, Morris Cohen, 
President Yeltsin conferred on him the posthumous title 
of Hero of the Russian Federation. 

The files of Directorate S noted by Mitrokhin reveal a 
quite different kind of illegal. Alongside the committed 
FCD officers who maintained their cover and professional 



discipline throughout their postings, there were others 
who could not cope when confronted by the contrast 
between the Soviet propaganda image of capitalist 
exploitation and the reality of life in the West. An even 
darker secret of the Directorate S records was that one of 
the principal uses of the illegals during the last quarter of 
a century of the Soviet Union was to search out and 
compromise dissidents in the other countries of the 
Warsaw Pact. The squalid struggle against “ideological 
subversion” was as much a responsibility of Directorate S 
as of the rest of the FCD. 

MITROKHIN WAS UNDERSTANDABLY cautious as 
he set out in 1972 to compile his forbidden FCD archive. 
For a few weeks he tried to commit names, codenames 
and key facts from the files to memory and transcribe 
them each evening when he returned home. Abandoning 
that process as too slow and cumbersome, he began to 
take notes in minuscule handwriting on scraps of paper 
which he crumpled up and threw into his wastepaper 
basket. Each evening, he retrieved his notes from the 
wastepaper and smuggled them out of Yasenevo 
concealed in his shoes. Gradually Mitrokhin became more 
confident as he satisfied himself that the Yasenevo 
security guards confined themselves to occasional 
inspections of bags and briefcases without attempting 
body searches. After a few months he started taking notes 
on ordinary sheets of office paper which he took out of 



his office in his jacket and trouser pockets. 

Not once in the twelve years which Mitrokhin spent 
noting the FCD archives was he stopped and searched. 
There were, however, some desperately anxious 
moments. From time to time he realized that, like other 
FCD officers, he was being tailed — probably by teams 
from the Seventh (Surveillance) or Second Chief 
(Counter-intelligence) Directorates. On one occasion 
while he was being followed, he visited the Dynamo 
Football Club sports shop and, to his horror, found 
himself standing next to two English visitors whom his 
watchers might suspect were spies with whom he had 
arranged a rendezvous. If he was searched, his notes on 
top secret files would be instantly discovered. Mitrokhin 
quickly moved on to other sports shops, hoping to 
convince his watchers that he was on a genuine shopping 
expedition. As he approached his apartment block, 
however, he noticed two men standing near the door to 
his ninth-floor flat. By the time he arrived, they had 
disappeared. FCD officers had standing instructions to 
report suspicious incidents such as this, but Mitrokhin did 
not do so for fear of prompting an investigation which 
would draw attention to the fact that he had been seen 
standing next to English visitors. 

Each night when he returned to his Moscow flat, 
Mitrokhin hid his notes beneath his mattress. On 
weekends he took them to a family dacha thirty-six 
kilometers from Moscow and typed up as many as 



possible, though the notes became so numerous that 
Mitrokhin was forced to leave some of them in 
handwritten form. He hid the first batches of typescripts 
and notes in a milk-chum which he buried below the 
floor. The dacha was built on raised foundations, 
leaving just enough room for Mitrokhin to crawl beneath 
the floorboards and dig a hole with a short-handled spade. 
He frequently found himself crawling through dog and cat 
feces and sometimes disturbed rats while he was digging, 
but he consoled himself with the thought that burglars 
were unlikely to follow him. When the milk-chum was 
full, he began concealing his notes and typescripts in a tin 
clothes-boiler. Eventually his archive also filled two tin 
tmnks and two aluminum cases, all of them buried 
beneath the dacha.^^ 

Mitrokhin’ s most anxious moment came when he 
arrived at his weekend dacha to find a stranger hiding in 
the attic. He was instantly reminded of the incident a few 
years earlier, in August 1971, when a friend of the writer 
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn had called unexpectedly at his 
dacha while Solzhenitsyn was away and surprised two 
KGB officers in the attic who were probably searching for 
subversive manuscripts. Other KGB men had quickly 
arrived on the scene and Solzhenitsyn’s friend had been 
badly beaten. Andropov cynically ordered Solzhenitsyn to 
be “informed that the participation of the KGB in this 
incident is a figment of his imagination.”^^ The incident 



was still fresh in Mitrokhin’s mind when he arrived at the 
dacha because he had recently noted files which recorded 
minutely detailed plans for the persecution of 
Solzhenitsyn and the “active measures” by which the 
KGB hoped to discredit him in the Western press. To his 
immense relief, however, the intruder in the attic turned 
out to be a homeless squatter. 

During summer holidays Mitrokhin worked on batches 
of his notes at a second family dacha near Penza, carrying 
them in an old haversack and dressing in peasant clothes 
in order not to attract attention. In the summer of 1918 
Penza, 630 kilometers southeast of Moscow, had been the 
site of one of the first peasant risings against Bolshevik 
rule. Lenin blamed the revolt on the kulaks (better-off 
peasants) and furiously instructed the local Party leaders 
to hang in public at least one hundred of them so that “for 
hundreds of kilometers around the people may see and 
tremble... By the 1970s, however, Penza’s counter- 
revolutionary past was long forgotten, and Lenin’s 
bloodthirsty orders for mass executions were kept from 
public view in the secret section of the Lenin archive. 

One of the most striking characteristics of the best 
literature produced under the Soviet regime is how much 
of it was written in secret. “To plunge underground,” 
wrote Solzhenitsyn, “to make it your concern not to win 
the world’s recognition — Heaven forbid! — ^but on the 
contrary to shun it: this variant of the writer’s lot is 
peculiarly our own, purely Russian, Russian and 



Soviet! Between the wars Mikhail Bulgakov had spent 
twelve years writing The Master and Margarita, one of 
the greatest novels of the twentieth century, knowing that 
it could not be published in his lifetime and fearing that it 
might never appear at all. His widow later recalled how, 
just before his death in 1940, Bulgakov “made me get out 
of bed and then, leaning on my arm, he walked through 
all the rooms, barefoot and in his dressing gown, to make 
sure that the manuscript of The Master was still there” in 
its hiding place.^^ Though Bulgakov’s great work 
survived, it was not published until a quarter of a century 
after his death. As late as 1978, it was denounced in a 
KGB memorandum to Andropov as “a dangerous weapon 
in the hands of [Western] ideological centers engaged in 
ideological sabotage against the Soviet Union. 

When Solzhenitsyn began writing in the 1950s, he told 
himself he had “entered into the inheritance of every 
modem writer intent on the tmth”: 

I must write simply to ensure that it was not 
forgotten, that posterity might some day come to 
know of it. Publication in my own lifetime I must 
shut out of my mind, out of my dreams. 

Just as Mitrokhin’s first notes were hidden in a milk- 
chum beneath his dacha, so Solzhenitsyn’s earliest 
writings, in minuscule handwriting, were squeezed into an 
empty champagne bottle and buried in his garden.^^ After 



the brief thaw in the early years of “de-Stalinization” 
which made possible the publication of Solzhenitsyn’s 
story of life in the gulag, One Day in the Life of Ivan 
Denisovich, he waged a timeconsuming struggle to try to 
prevent the KGB from seizing his other manuscripts until 
he was finally forced into exile in 1974.^^ It did not occur 
to Mitrokhin to compare himself with such literary giants 
as Bulgakov and Solzhenitsyn. But, like them, he began 
assembling his archive “to ensure that the truth was not 
forgotten, that posterity might some day come to know of 
it.” 

THE KGB FILES which had the greatest emotional 
impact on Mitrokhin were those on the war in 
Afghanistan. On December 28, 1979 Babrak Karmal, the 
new Afghan leader chosen by Moscow to request 
“fraternal assistance” by the Red Army which had already 
invaded his country, announced over Kabul Radio that his 
predecessor, Hafizullah Amin, an “agent of American 
imperialism,” had been tried by a “revolutionary tribunal” 
and sentenced to death. Mitrokhin quickly discovered 
from the files on the war which flooded into the archives 
that Amin had in reality been assassinated, together with 
his family and entourage, in an assault on the Kabul 
presidential palace by KGB special forces disguised in 
Afghan uniforms. 

The female clerks who filed KGB reports on the war in 
the archives after they had been circulated to the Politburo 



and other sections of the Soviet hierarchy had so much 
material to deal with that they sometimes submitted to 
Mitrokhin thirty files at a time for his approval. The 
horrors recorded in the files were carefully concealed 
from the Soviet people. The Soviet media preserved a 
conspiracy of silence about the systematic destruction of 
thousands of Afghan villages, reduced to forlorn groups 
of uninhabited, roofless mud-brick houses; the flight of 
four million refugees; and the death of a million Afghans 
in a war which Gorbachev later described as a “mistake.” 
The coffins of the 15,000 Red Army troops killed in the 
conflict were unloaded silently at Soviet airfields, with 
none of the military pomp and solemn music which 
traditionally awaited fallen heroes returning to the 
Motherland. Funerals were held in secret, and families 
told simply that their loved ones had died “fulfilling their 
internationalist duty.” Some were buried in plots near the 
graves of Mitrokhin ’s parents in the cemetery at 
Kuzminsky Monastery. No reference to Afghanistan was 
allowed on their tombstones. During the Afghan War 
Mitrokhin heard the first open criticism of Soviet policy 
by his more outspoken colleagues at Yasenevo. “Doesn’t 
the war make you ashamed to be Russian?” an FCD 
colonel asked him one day. “Ashamed to be Soviet, you 
mean!” Mitrokhin blurted out. 

When Mitrokhin retired in 1984, he was still 
preoccupied with the Afghan War. He spent the first year 
and a half of his retirement sorting through his notes. 



extracting the material on Afghanistan, and assembling it 
in a large volume with a linking narrative. Despite 
Gorbachev’s call for glasnost after he became Party 
leader in 1985, Mitrokhin did not believe the Soviet 
system would ever allow the truth about the war to be 
told. Increasingly, however, he began to think of ways of 
transporting his archive to the West and publishing it 
there. 

One novel method suggested itself on May 28, 1987, 
when a single-engine Cessna piloted by a nineteen-year- 
old West German, Matthias Rust, crossed the Finnish 
border into Soviet airspace and flew undetected for 450 
miles before landing in Red Square. After an hour of 
confusion, during which Kremlin security guards 
wondered whether Rust was an actor in a film, he was 
taken away to the KGB’s Lefortovo Prison. Mitrokhin 
briefly considered but quickly abandoned the idea of 
using a microlite from a KGB sports club to fly with his 
archive in the opposite direction to Finland. 

The most practical of the various schemes considered 
by Mitrokhin before the collapse of the Soviet Union was 
to get a position on the local Party committee which 
issued permits for foreign travel, obtain permits for 
himself and his family, then book reservations on a cruise 
from Leningrad to Odessa in the Black Sea. At one of the 
cruise’s West European ports of call, Mitrokhin would 
make contact with the authorities and arrange to leave his 
archive in a dead letter-box near Moscow for collection 



by a Western intelligence agency. He eventually 
abandoned the idea because of the difficulty of separating 
himself from the Soviet tour group and the ever-watchful 
group leaders for long enough to tell his story and arrange 
the hand-over. 

As the Berlin Wall came down in November 1989 and 
the Soviet Bloc began to disintegrate, Mitrokhin told 
himself to be patient and wait for his opportunity. In the 
meantime he carried on typing up his handwritten notes in 
his Moscow flat and at the two family dachas, assembling 
some of them in volumes covering the FCD’s chief target 
countries — first and foremost the United States, known in 
KGB jargon as the “Main Adversary.” He shared the 
relief of most Muscovites at the failure of the hardline 
coup in August 1991 to depose Gorbachev and reestablish 
the one-party Soviet state. It came as no surprise to 
Mitrokhin that the chief ringleader in the failed coup was 
Vladimir Aleksandrovich Kryuchkov, head of the FCD 
from 1974 to 1988 and chairman of the KGB from 1988 
until the coup. 

Though Kryuchkov proved better at public relations 
than most previous KGB chairmen, he had long 
represented much of what Mitrokhin most detested in the 
FCD. As a young diplomat at the Soviet embassy in 
Budapest, Kryuchkov had caught the eye of the 
ambassador, Yuri Andropov, by his uncompromising 
opposition to the “counter-revolutionary” Hungarian 
Uprising of 1956. When Andropov became KGB 



chairman in 1967, Kryuchkov became head of his 
personal secretariat and a loyal supporter of his obsessive 
campaign against “ideological subversion” in all its 
forms. The files seen by Mitrokhin showed that, as head 
of the FCD, Kryuchkov collaborated closely with the 
KGB Fifth (Ideological Subversion) Directorate in the 
war against dissidents at home and abroad.^^ He had 
made a senior member of the Fifth Directorate, 1. A. 
Markelov, one of the deputy heads of the FCD with 
responsibility for coordinating the struggle against 
ideological subversion.^^ The failed coup of August 1991 
marked an appropriately discreditable end to Kryuchkov’s 
KGB career. Instead of shoring up the Soviet Union and 
the one-party state, it served only to hasten their collapse. 

On October 11, 1991, the State Council of the 
disintegrating Soviet Union abolished the KGB in its 
existing form. The former FCD was reconstituted as the 
SVR, the foreign intelligence service of the Russian 
Federation, independent of the internal security service. 
Instead of repudiating its Soviet past, however, the SVR 
saw itself as the heir of the old FCD. Mitrokhin had seen 
the FCD file on the SVR’s newly appointed head. 
Academician Yevgeni Maksimovich Primakov, 
previously Director of the Institute of World Economics 
and International Relations and one of Gorbachev’s 
leading foreign policy advisers. The file identified 
Primakov as a KGB co-optee, codenamed MAKSIM, who 
had been sent on frequent intelligence missions to the 



United States and the Middle East.^^ Primakov went on to 
become Boris Yeltsin’s Foreign Minister in 1996 and 
Prime Minister in 1998. 


IN THE FINAL months of 1991, the breakup of the 
Soviet Union and the relative weakness of frontier 
controls at the new borders of the Russian Federation at 
last opened the way to the West for Mitrokhin and his 
archive. In March 1992 he boarded an overnight train in 
Moscow bound for the capital of one of the newly 
independent Baltic republics. With him he took a case 
on wheels, containing bread, sausages and drink for his 
journey on top, clothes underneath, and — at the bottom — 
samples of his notes. The next day he arrived 
unannounced at the British embassy in the Baltic capital 
and asked to speak to “someone in authority.” Hitherto 
Mitrokhin had had an image of the British as rather 
formal and “a bit of a mystery.” But the young female 
diplomat who received him at the embassy struck him as 
“young, attractive and sympathetic,” as well as fluent in 
Russian. Mitrokhin told her he had brought with him 
important material from KGB files. While he rummaged 
at the bottom of his bag to extract his notes from beneath 
the sausages and clothes, the diplomat ordered tea. As 
Mitrokhin drank his first cup of English tea, she read 
some of his notes, then questioned him about them. 
Mitrokhin told her they were only part of a large personal 
archive which included material on KGB operations in 



Britain. He agreed to return to the embassy a month later 
to meet representatives from the Secret Intelligence 
Service. 

Emboldened by the ease with which he had crossed the 
Russian frontier in March, Mitrokhin brought with him on 
his next trip to the Baltic capital 2,000 typed pages which 
he had removed from the hiding place beneath his dacha 
near Moscow. Arriving at the British embassy on the 
morning of April 9, he identified himself to the SIS 
officers by producing his passport. Communist Party card 
and KGB pension certificate, handed over his bulky 
typescript and spent a day answering questions about 
himself, his archive and how he had compiled it. 
Mitrokhin accepted an invitation to return to the embassy 
about two months later to discuss arrangements for a visit 
to Britain. Early in May the SIS Moscow station reported 
to London that Mitrokhin planned to leave Moscow on an 
overnight train on June 10. On June 11 he arrived in the 
Baltic capital carrying a rucksack containing more 
material from his archive. Most of his meeting with SIS 
officers was spent discussing plans for him to be 
debriefed in Britain during the following autumn. 

On September 7, escorted by SIS, Mitrokhin arrived in 
England for the first time. After the near chaos of post- 
Communist Moscow, London made an extraordinary 
impression on him — “the model of what a capital city 
should be.” At the time, even the heavy traffic, dotted 
with the black cabs and red doubledecker buses he had 



seen only in photographs, seemed but proof of the 
capital’s prosperity. While being debriefed at anonymous 
safe houses in London and the countryside, Mitrokhin 
took the final decision to leave Russia for Britain, and 
agreed with SIS on arrangements to exfiltrate himself, his 
family and his archive. On October 13 he was infiltrated 
back into Russia to make final arrangements for his 
departure. 

On November 7, 1992, the seventy-fifth anniversary of 
the Bolshevik Revolution, Mitrokhin arrived with his 
family in the Baltic capital where he had first made 
contact with SIS. A few days later they arrived in London 
to begin a new life in Britain. It was a bittersweet 
moment. Mitrokhin was safe and secure for the first time 
since he had begun assembling his secret archive eighteen 
years previously, but at the same time he felt a sense of 
bereavement at separation from a homeland he knew he 
would probably never see again. The bereavement has 
passed, though his attachment to Russia remains. 
Mitrokhin is now a British citizen. Using his senior 
citizen’s railcard to travel the length and breadth of the 
country, he has seen more of Britain than most who were 
bom here. Since 1992 he has spent several days a week 
working on his archive, typing up the remaining 
handwritten notes, and responding to questions about his 
archive from intelligence services from five continents. 
Late in 1995 he had his first meeting with Christopher 
Andrew to discuss the preparation of this book. Though 



The Sword and the Shield could not have been written in 
Russia, Mitrokhin remains as convinced as he was in 
1972 that the secret history of the KGB is a central part of 
the Soviet past which the Russian people have the right to 
know. He also believes that the KGB’s worldwide foreign 
operations form an essential, though often neglected, part 
of the history of twentieth-century international relations. 

NO WORD LEAKED out in the British media about 
either Mitrokhin or his archive. Because material from the 
archive was passed to so many other intelligence and 
security services, however, there were, unsurprisingly, 
some partial leaks abroad. The first, slightly garbled 
reference to Mitrokhin ’s archive occurred in the United 
States nine months after his defection. In August 1993 the 
well-known Washington investigative journalist Ronald 
Kessler published a bestselling book on the FBI based in 
part on sources inside the Bureau. Among his revelations 
was a brief reference to a sensational “probe by the FBI 
into information from a former KGB employee who had 
had access to KGB files”: 

According to his account, the KGB had had many 
hundreds of Americans and possibly more than a 
thousand spying for them in recent years. So specific 
was the information that the FBI was quickly able to 
establish the source’s credibility... By the summer of 
1993, the FBI had mobilized agents in most major 



cities to pursue the cases. A top secret meeting was 
called at Quantico [the FBI National Academy] to 
plot strategy. 

Kessler did not name any of the “many hundreds of 
Americans” identified by the defector. An unnamed “US 
intelligence official” interviewed by the Washington Post 
“confirmed that the FBI had received specific information 
that has led to a ‘significant’ ongoing investigation into 
past KGB activities in the United States,” but declined to 
be drawn in on “how many people are implicated. 
Time reported that “sources familiar with the case” of the 
KGB defector had identified him as a former employee of 
the First Chief Directorate, but had described Kessler’s 
figures for the number of “recenf’ Soviet spies in the 
United States as “highly exaggerated.”^^ 

Mitrokhin’s notes do indeed contain the names of 
“many hundreds” of KGB officers, agents and contacts in 
the United States active at various periods since the 
1920s. Kessler, however, wrongly suggested that this 
number applied to “recent years” rather than to the whole 
history of Soviet espionage in the United States. Though 
his figures were publicly disputed, the suggestion that the 
KGB defector had gone to the United States rather than to 
Britain went unchallenged.^^ When no further information 
on the unidentified defector was forthcoming, media 
interest in the story quickly died away. 



There was no further leak from Mitrokhin’s archive for 
over three years. In October 1996, however, reports in the 
French press alleged that Charles Hemu, Defence 
Minister from 1981 to 1985, had worked for Soviet Bloc 
intelligence services from 1953 until at least 1963, and 
that, when informed by the French security service, the 
DST, President Francois Mitterrand had hushed the 
scandal up.^^ Le Monde reported that from 1993 onwards 
British intelligence had passed on to the DST “a list of 
about 300 names of diplomats and officials of the Quai 
d’Orsay alleged to have worked for Soviet Bloc 
intelligence.”^^ In reality, French diplomats and Foreign 
Ministry officials made up only a minority of the names 
in Mitrokhin’s notes supplied by the SIS to the DST. 
Charles Hemu was not among them.^^ None of the media 
reports on either side of the Channel related the SIS lists 
of Soviet agents in France to Kessler’s earlier story of a 
defector with extensive access to KGB files. 

In December 1996 the German weekly Focus reported 
that, according to “reliable sources,” SIS had also 
provided the BfV, the German security service, with the 
names of several hundred German politicians, 
businessmen, lawyers and police officers who had been 
involved with the KGB. On this occasion the SIS source 
was identified as a Russian defector who had had 
extensive access to the KGB archives. A later article in 
Focus reported: 



The Federal Prosecutor has been examining 
numerous detailed new leads to a hitherto 
undiscovered agent network of the former Soviet 
secret service, the KGB, in Germany. The 
researchers in Karlsruhe are primarily concentrating 
on Moscow sources who were taken on by the 
successors to the KGB and have probably been 
reactivated since the end of the Cold War. 

The basis for the research is extensive information 
on agents which a Russian defector smuggled into 
London from the Moscow secret service. After 
intensive analysis, the British secret service passed 
all information on KGB connections in Germany to 
the BfV in Cologne in early 1996.^^ 

In July 1997 another leak from Mitrokhin’s archive 
occurred in Austria. Press reports quoted a KGB 
document giving directions for locating a secret arms 
dump of mines, explosives and detonators, codenamed 
GROT, hidden in a dead letter-box near Salzburg in 1963, 
which had been intended for use in sabotage operations: 

Leave the town of Salzburg by the Schallmoser 
Haupstrasse leading to Highway No. 158. At a 
distance of 8 km from the town limit, in the direction 
of Bad Ischl-Graz, there is a large stone bridge 
across a narrow valley. Before reaching this bridge, 
leave the federal highway by turning right on to a 



local road which follows the valley in the direction 
of Ebenau; then go on 200 meters to the end of the 
metal parapet, which stands on the left-hand side of 
the road. On reaching the end of the parapet, turn left 
at once and follow a village road leading in the 
opposite direction. The DLB is located about 50 
meters (60 paces) from the turn-off point leading 
from the main road on to the village road ...^^ 

Though the Austrian press did not mention it, the 
document came from Mitrokhin’s archive, which also 
revealed that in 1964 road repair works had covered the 
entrance to the DLB, raised the ground level, and changed 
the layout of the surrounding area. The KGB had decided 
not to try to recover and relocate the GROT arms dump. 
Attempts by the Austrian authorities to find the dump in 
1997 also failed.^^ Mitrokhin’s notes reveal that similar 
KGB arms and radio caches, some of them booby- 
trapped, are scattered around much of Europe and North 
America.^^ 

The press leak which came closest to revealing the 
existence of Mitrokhin’s archive was a further article in 
the German weekly Focus, in June 1998. Focus reported 
that a colonel in the FCD registry with access to “all the 
files on Moscow’s agents” had smuggled handwritten 
copies of them out of KGB headquarters to his dacha near 
Moscow. In 1992 he had defected to Britain and, 
according to Focus, SIS agents had brought the 



“explosive” notes hidden in the dacha back to London.^^ 
Four years later, in an operation codenamed WEEKEND, 
SIS had allegedly briefed the BfV on the German material 
in the archive. According to Focus, “The defector has 
presented the BfV with hundreds of leads to Moscow’s 
spy network in the Federal Republic of Germany.” A 
“high-ranking BfV official” was said to have commented, 
“We were quite shocked at how much [the defector] 
knew. Moscow clearly possesses tons of blackmail 
material.” The BfV was reported to have received new 
leads on fifty espionage cases and to have begun twelve 
new investigations.^^ 

The Focus article, however, inspired widespread 
skepticism — ^partly because the story of a top secret KGB 
archive exfiltrated from a Russian dacha seemed 
inherently improbable, partly because the only detailed 
example given by Focus of the intelligence it contained 
was the sensational allegation that the former Chancellor, 
Willy Brandt, “the icon of Germany’s Social Democrats,” 
had been a Soviet spy during the Second World War. The 
Brandt story was instantly dismissed as “completely 
absurd” by Yuri Kobaladze, head of the SVR press 
bureau. When asked why in this instance the SVR was 
abandoning its usual practice of not commenting on 
individuals alleged to be Russian spies, Kobaladze 
replied: 


It would naturally be very flattering to have such a 



high-ranking politician on our list of credits, but in 
the interests of preserving historical truth we felt it 
necessary to reject this fiction, which could be 
misused for political purposes. 

Kobaladze also dismissed the story of the secret archive 
in a KGB colonel’s dacha as a myth. The source of the 
Brandt story, he insisted, could only be a former KGB 
major in the Oslo residency, Mikhail Butkov, who had 
defected to Britain in 1991.^^ 

Though wrong about the secret archive, Kobaladze was 
right to reject the allegation that Brandt had been a Soviet 
spy. Mitrokhin’s notes reveal that the KGB archives do 
indeed contain a file on Brandt (codenamed 
POLYARNIK), which shows that while in Stockholm 
during the Second World War he passed on information 
to the NKVD residency. But, as the file makes clear, 
Brandt was also in touch with British and American 
intelligence officers — as well as with the Norwegian 
former secretary of Leon Trotsky, regarded by the NKVD 
as the greatest traitor in Soviet history. Brandt’s 
overriding motive was to provide any information to all 
three members of the wartime Grand Alliance which 
might hasten the defeat of Adolf Hitler. In the case of the 
Soviet Union, he calculated — accurately — that his best 
channel of communication with Moscow was via the 
Stockholm residency. The real embarrassment in the 
POLYARNIK file concerns the role not of Brandt but of 



the KGB. In 1962, almost certainly with Khrushchev’s 
personal approval, the KGB embarked on an operation to 
blackmail Brandt by threatening to use the evidence of his 
wartime dealings with the Stockholm residency to “cause 
unpleasantness” unless he agreed to cooperate. The 
attempted blackmail failed.^^ 

LIKE THE BFV and Austrian counter intelligence, a 
number of other security services and intelligence 
agencies around the world from Scandinavia to Japan 
have been pursuing leads from Mitrokhin’s archive for 
several years — usually unnoticed by the media. Most of 
the leads have been used for counterintelligence purposes 
— to help resolve unsolved cases and neutralize SVR 
operations begun in the KGB era — rather than to mount 
prosecutions. There have, however, been a number of 
convictions which derive from Mitrokhin’s evidence. 

On one occasion, Mitrokhin himself was almost called 
to give evidence in court. The case concerned Robert 
Lipka, an army clerk assigned in the mid-1960s to the 
National Security Agency (NS A, the US SIGINT service), 
whom Mitrokhin had identified as a KGB agent.^^ In May 
1993 FBI agent Dmitri Drouj insky contacted Lipka, 
posing as “Sergei Nikitin,” a GRU officer based in 
Washington. Lipka complained that he was still owed 
money for his espionage over a quarter of a century 
earlier, and was given a total of $10,000 by “Nikitin” over 
the next few months. He appeared confident that he could 



no longer be prosecuted. “The statute of limitations,” he 
told “Nikitin,” “has run out.” “Nikitin” corrected him: “In 
American law the statute of limitations for espionage 
never runs out.” Lipka replied that, whatever the legal 
position, he “would never admit to anything.” After a 
lengthy FBI investigation, Lipka was arrested in February 
1996 at his home in Millersville, Pennsylvania, and 
charged with handing classified documents to the Soviet 
Union.^^ 

Since Lipka denied all charges against him, Mitrokhin 
expected to give evidence at his trial in the U.S. District 
Court, Philadelphia, in May 1997. But, in what the 
Philadelphia Inquirer termed “a surprising turnaround” in 
the courtroom, Lipka “exploded into tears as he confessed 
that he had handed over classified information to KGB 
agents.” Lipka had been persuaded by his lawyer, Ronald 
F. Kidd, to accept a prosecution offer of a plea bargain 
which would limit his sentence to eighteen years’ 
imprisonment with time off for good behavior, rather than 
continue to plead not guilty and face the prospect of 
spending the rest of his life in jail. Though Mitrokhin ’s 
name was never mentioned in court, it was the evidence 
he had obtained from KGB files which seems to have 
prompted Lipka’ s change of heart. “We saw how 
significant the evidence was,” his lawyer told reporters. 
“But the government also realized they couldn’t go 
through a full trial and not have the mystery witness 
exposed.” The “mystery witness” was Mitrokhin. After 



Lipka’s confession, U.S. Assistant Attorney Barbara J. 
Cohan admitted, “We had a very sensitive witness who, if 
he had had to testify, would have had to testify behind a 
screen and under an assumed name, and now we don’t 
have to surface him at all.”^^ “I feel like Rip Van Spy,” 
said Lipka when he was sentenced in September 1997. “I 
thought I had put this to bed many years ago and I never 
dreamed it would turn out like this.” As well as being 
sentenced to eighteen years’ imprisonment and fined 
10,000 dollars, Lipka was ordered to repay the further 
10,000 dollars from FBI funds given him by “Nikitin.”^^ 

There are many other “Rip Van Spies” whose 
memories of Cold War espionage are likely to be 
reawakened by Mitrokhin’s archive. Some will recognize 
themselves in the pages which follow. About a dozen 
important cases which are still being actively pursued — 
including several in leading NATO countries — cannot be 
referred to for legal reasons until they come to court. Only 
a small minority of the Soviet agents whose codenames 
appear in this volume, however, are likely to be 
prosecuted. But, as the SVR embarks on the biggest and 
most complex damage assessment in Russian intelligence 
history, it has to face the unsettling possibility that some 
of the spies identified by Mitrokhin have since been 
turned into double agents. 

After each of the revelations from Mitrokhin’s archive 
mentioned above, the SVR undoubtedly conducted the 
usual damage assessment exercise in an attempt to 



determine the source and seriousness of the leak. Its 
official statement in 1996 (effectively reaffirmed as 
recently as June 1998), which dismissed as “absolute 
nonsense” the suggestion that the names of several 
hundred Soviet agents could possibly have been given by 
a defector to any Western intelligence agency, 
demonstrates that the conclusions of these exercises were 
very wide of the mark. Not until the publication of this 
book was announced in 1999 did the SVR seem to begin 
to grasp the massive hemorrhage of intelligence which 
had occurred. 

SOME OF THE files noted by Mitrokhin give a vivid 
indication of the ferocity with which the Centre (KGB 
headquarters) has traditionally responded to intelligence 
leaks about its past foreign operations. The publication in 
1974 of John Barron’s KGB: The Secret Work of Soviet 
Secret Agents based on information from Soviet 
defectors and Western intelligence agencies, generated no 
fewer than 370 KGB damage assessments and other 
reports. The resident in Washington, Mikhail Korney evich 
Polonik (codenamed ARDOV), was instructed to obtain 
all available information on Barron, then a senior editor at 
Reader's Digest, and to suggest ways “to compromise 
him.”^^ Most of the “active measures” used by the KGB 
in its attempts to discredit Barron made much of his 
Jewish origins, but its fabricated claims that he was part 
of a Zionist conspiracy (a favorite theme in Soviet 



disinformation) appear to have had little resonance 
outside the Middle East.^^ 

The active measures employed against some of the 
journalists who wrote articles based on Barron’s book 
were more imaginative. Doctored versions of blank 
“information cards” from the Austrian Stapo (security 
police) registry previously obtained by KGB agents were 
used to compromise Austrian journalists judged to have 
used material from KGB: The Secret Work of Soviet 
Secret Agents to undermine the “peaceloving” policies of 
the USSR. Fabricated entries on the cards prepared by 
Service A, the FCD active measures specialists, purported 
to show that the Stapo believed the journalists concerned 
to be hand-in-glove with the CIA. Photocopies of the 
cards were then circulated among the Austrian media. The 
files noted by Mitrokhin list other KGB countermeasures 
against Barron’s book in countries as far afield as Turkey, 
Cyprus, Fibya, Febanon, Egypt, Iran, Kuwait, Somalia, 
Uganda, India, Sri Fanka and Afghanistan.^^ 

The other study of the KGB which did the most to 
arouse the ire of the Centre was the history published in 
1990 by Christopher Andrew and Oleg Gordlevsky, KGB: 
The Inside Story of Its Foreign Operations from Lenin to 
Gorbachev, which drew on KGB documents and other 
information obtained by Gordlevsky while working as a 
British agent inside the KGB from 1974 to 1985.^^ The 
Centre predictably responded with active measures 



against both the book and its authors. (Some indication 
of its continuing hostility to Gordievsky is provided by 
the fact that, at the time of this writing, he is still under 
sentence of death in Moscow.) There was, however, one 
important new element in the reaction of the KGB, and of 
its chairman Kryuchkov in particular, to the publication of 
the history by Andrew and Gordievsky. In a top secret 
“Chairman’s Order” of September 1990 emphasizing the 
importance of influence operations and other active 
measures (“one of the most important functions of the 
KGB’s foreign intelligence service”), Kryuchkov 
instructed that “wider use should be made of archive 
material” to publicize a “positive” image of the KGB and 
“its more celebrated cases. 

The first approach to a Western writer offering material 
from KGB archives intended to create this “positive” 
image was to the mercurial John Costello, a freelance 
British historian who combined flair for research with a 
penchant for conspiracy theory. In 1991 Costello 
published a book on the mysterious flight to Britain fifty 
years previously of Hitler’s deputy Fiihrer, Rudolf Hess, 
which drew on KGB records selected by the SVR as well 
as Western sources, and argued (implausibly, in the view 
of most experts on the period) that the key to the whole 
affair was a plot by British intelligence.^^ Two years later, 
in collaboration with the SVR consultant (and former 
FCD officer) Oleg Tsarev, Costello published a somewhat 



less controversial biography of the inter-war Soviet 
intelligence officer Aleksandr Orlov which was described 
on the dustjacket as “The first book from the KGB 
archives — the KGB secrets the British government 
doesn’t want you to read.” The book began with tributes 
to the disgraced former chairman of the KGB, Vladimir 
Kryuchkov, and the last head of the FCD, Leonid 
Vladimirovich Shebarshin, for initiating the project. 
Costello added a note of “personal gratitude” to the SVR 
“for the ongoing support that they have given to this 
project which has established a new precedent for 
openness and objectivity in the study of intelligence 
history, not only in Russia, but the rest of the world. 

The Costello-Tsarev combination set the pattern for 
other collaborations between Russian authors selected or 
approved by the SVR and Western writers (who have 
included both well-known historians and a senior retired 
CIA officer): a project initially sponsored, but later 
abandoned, by Crown Books in the United States. For 
each volume in the series, which covers topics from the 
inter- war period to the early Cold War, the SVR has given 
the authors exclusive access to copies of previously top 
secret documents selected by it from KGB archives. All 
the books published so far have contained interesting and 
sometimes important new material; several are also 
impressive for the quality of their historical analysis. 
Their main weakness, for which the authors cannot be 
blamed, is that the choice of KGB documents on which 



they are based has been made not by them but by the 

SVR.63 

The choice is sometimes highly selective. During the 
1990s, for example, the SVR has made available to 
Russian and Western authors four successive tranches 
from the bulky file of the KGB’s most famous British 
agent, Kim Philby.^^ In order to preserve both Philby’s 
heroic image and the reputation of Russian foreign 
intelligence, however, the SVR has been careful not to 
release the record of Philby’s final weeks as head of the 
SIS station in the United States (the climax of his career 
as a Soviet spy), when money and instructions intended 
for Philby were mislaid, and he fell out with his 
incompetent controller who was subsequently recalled to 
Moscow in disgrace. Mitrokhin’s notes on those parts of 
the Philby file still considered by the SVR unsuitable for 
public consumption reveal this farcical episode for the 
first time.^^ 

The SVR has publicly denied even the existence of 
some of the files which it finds embarrassing. While 
writing a history of KGB-CIA rivalry in Berlin before the 
construction of the Wall, based partly on documents 
selected by the SVR, the Russian and American authors 
(one of them a former deputy head of the FCD) asked to 
see the file of the KGB agent Aleksandr Grigoryevich 
Kopatzky (alias Igor Orlov). The SVR replied that it had 
no record of any agent of that name. Its only record of 



“Igor Orlov” was, it claimed, of a visit made by him to the 
Soviet embassy in Washington in 1965, when he 
complained of FBI harassment and enquired about asylum 
in the USSR.^^ Though still officially an unperson in the 
SVR version of Russian intelligence history, Kopatzky 
was in reality one of the KGB’s most highly rated agents. 
His supposedly non-existent KGB file, noted by 
Mitrokhin, reveals that he had no fewer than twenty-three 
controllers.^^ 

As well as initiating an unprecedented series of 
collaborative histories for publication in the West, the 
SVR has produced a number of less sophisticated works 
for the Russian market. In 1995, to mark the seventy-fifth 
anniversary of the foundation of the Soviet foreign 
intelligence service, of which it sees itself as the heir, the 
SVR published a volume on the careers of seventy-five 
intelligence officers — all, it appears, sans peur et sans 
reproche — which differs little from the uncritical 
hagiographies of the KGB era.^^ In 1995 the SVR also 
began the publication of a multi-volume official history of 
KGB foreign operations which by 1997 had reached the 
beginning of the Great Patriotic War.^^ Though a mine of 
mostly reliable factual information, it too presents a 
selective and sanitized view of Soviet intelligence history. 
It also preserves, in a mercifully diluted form, some of the 
traditional conspiracy theories of the KGB. The literary 
editor of the official history, Lolly Zamoysky, was 



formerly a senior FCD analyst, well known within the 
Centre and foreign residencies for his belief in a global 
Masonic-Zionist plot7^ In 1989 he published a volume 
grandly entitled Behind the Fagade of the Masonic 
Temple, which blamed the Freemasons for, inter alia, the 
outbreak of the Cold War 

The underlying rationale for the SVR’s selection of 
topics and documents for histories of past operations is to 
present Soviet foreign intelligence as a dedicated and 
highly professional service, performing much the same 
functions as its Western counterparts but, more often than 
not, winning the contest against them.^^ Even under 
Stalin, foreign intelligence is presented as the victim 
rather than the perpetrator of the Terror^^ — despite the 
fact that during the later 1930s hunting down “enemies of 
the people” abroad became its main priority Similarly, 
the SVR seeks to distance the foreign intelligence 
operations of the FCD during the Cold War from the 
abuse of human rights by the domestic KGB. In reality, 
however, the struggle against “ideological subversion” 
both at home and abroad was carefully coordinated. The 
KGB took a central role in the suppression of the 
Hungarian Uprising in 1956, the crushing of the Prague 
Spring in 1968, the invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, and 
the pressure on the Polish regime to destroy Solidarity in 
1981. Closely linked to the persecution of dissidents 
within the Soviet Union were the FCD’s PROGRESS 



operations against dissidents in the rest of the Soviet Bloc 
and its constant harassment of those who had taken refuge 
in the West7^ By the mid-1970s the BCD’s war against 
ideological subversion extended even to operations 
against Western Communist leaders who were judged to 
have deviated from Moscow’s rigid Party line7^ 

On these and many other operations, Mitrokhin’s 
archive contains much material from KGB files which the 
SVR is still anxious to keep from public view. Unlike the 
documents selected for declassification by the SVR, none 
of which are more recent than the early 1960s, his archive 
covers almost the whole of the Cold War. Most of it is 
still highly classified in Moscow. The originals of some of 
the most important documents noted or transcribed by 
Mitrokhin may no longer exist. In 1989 most of the huge 
multi-volume file on the dissident Andrei Sakharov, 
earlier branded “Public Enemy Number One” by 
Andropov, was destroyed. Soon afterwards, Kryuchkov 
announced that all files on other dissidents charged under 
the infamous Article 70 of the criminal code (anti-Soviet 
agitation and propaganda) were being shredded. In a 
number of cases, Mitrokhin’s notes on them may now be 
all that survives. 

Vasili Mitrokhin has thus made it possible to extend 
what John Costello praised in 1993 as the “new precedent 
for openness and objectivity in the study of intelligence 
history” set by Kryuchkov and his SVR successors far 



beyond the limits any of them could have envisaged. 



TWO 


FROM LENIN’S CHEKA TO STALIN’S 

OGPU 


For most of Mitrokhin’s career in the KGB, the history of 
its domestic operations was something of an 
embarrassment even to its own historians. During the late 
1930s the KGB (then known as the NKVD) had been the 
chief instrument of Stalin’s Great Terror, the greatest 
peacetime persecution in European history. The KGB 
officers club in the Lubyanka, its Moscow headquarters, 
lacked even the usual boardroom photographs of past 
chairmen; most were more suited to a chamber of horrors 
than to a hall of fame. Three had been shot after being 
found guilty of horrific crimes (some real, others 
imaginary): Genrikh Yagoda in 1938, Nikolai Yezhov in 
1940 and Lavrenti Beria in 1953. A fourth — Ivan Serov — 
blew his brains out in 1963. KGB historians in the post- 
Stalin era tended to take refuge from the blood-stained 
reality of their Stalinist past and homicidal former 
chairmen by returning to an earlier, mostly mythical, 
Leninist golden age of revolutionary purity. 



The KGB traced its origins to the foundation on 
December 20, 1917, six weeks after the Bolshevik 
Revolution, of the Cheka, the first Soviet security and 
intelligence agency. Throughout Mitrokhin’s career, KGB 
officers styled themselves Chekists (Chekisty) and were 
paid their salaries not on the first but on the twentieth of 
each month (“Chekists’ Day”) in honor of the Cheka’s 
birthday. The KGB also adopted the Cheka symbols of 
the sword and the shield: the shield to defend the 
revolution, the sword to smite its foes. Outside the 
Lubyanka, the KGB’s Moscow headquarters, stood a 
huge statue of the Polish-bom head of the Cheka, Feliks 
Dzerzhinsky, venerated in countless official 
hagiographies as the selfless, incormptible “Knight of the 
Revolution” who slew the dragon of counter-revolution 
which threatened the young Soviet state. He had been a 
professional revolutionary for over twenty years before 
the Revolution, spending eleven of those years in Tsarist 
prisons, penal servitude or exile. KGB training manuals 
quoted his description of the Chekist as a man with “a 
warm heart, a cool head and clean hands.” Like Lenin, he 
was an incormptible workaholic, prepared to sacrifice 
both himself and others in the defense of the Revolution. ^ 
In the headquarters of the KGB First Chief (Foreign 
Intelligence) Directorate at Yasenevo, the main object of 
veneration was a large bust of Dzerzhinsky on a marble 
pedestal constantly surrounded by fresh flowers. 

The KGB’s effusive public tributes to its saintly 



founding father concealed the degree to which 
Dzerzhinsky derived his intelligence tradecraft from the 
Cheka’s much smaller Tsarist predecessor, the Okhrana. 
The Bolsheviks had extensive first-hand experience of the 
Okhrana’ s expertise in the use of penetration agents and 
agents provocateurs. In July 1913 Lenin had discussed 
the difficult problem of Okhrana penetration with two of 
his chief lieutenants, Lev Kamenev and Grigori Zinovyev, 
and the leader of the Bolshevik deputies in the Duma, 
Roman Malinovsky. All were agreed that there must be an 
unidentified Okhrana agent in close contact with the 
Bolshevik deputies. The agent was in even closer contact 
than Lenin realized. It was Roman Malinovsky. After 
Okhrana files later revealed his identity, he was shot in 
the Kremlin gardens on the first anniversary of the 
Bolshevik Revolution.^ 

The Cheka’s success in penetrating its opponents 
derived in large part from its imitation of the techniques 
employed by Malinovsky and other Tsarist agents. Dmitri 
Gavrilovich Yevseyev, the author of two of the Cheka’s 
earliest operational manuals, Basic Tenets of Intelligence 
and Brief Instructions for the Cheka on How to Conduct 
Intelligence, based his writings on detailed study of 
Okhrana tradecraft. Though the Cheka was “an organ for 
building the dictatorship of the proletariat,” Yevseyev 
insisted — like Dzerzhinsky — that it must not hesitate to 
learn from the experience of “bourgeois” intelligence 
agencies.^ 



The Cheka’s early priorities were overwhelmingly 
domestic. Dzerzhinsky described it as “an organ for the 
revolutionary settlement of accounts with 
counterrevolutionaries,” ^ a label increasingly applied to 
all the Bolsheviks’ opponents and “class enemies.” 
Within days of its foundation, however, the Cheka had 
also taken its first tentative steps in foreign intelligence 
collection. The career of the first agent sent on a mission 
abroad, Aleksei Frolovich Filippov, was sadly at variance 
with the heroic image which KGB historians struggled to 
maintain in their descriptions of the Leninist era. Bom in 
1870 and trained as a lawyer, Filippov had made a career 
before the Revolution as a newspaper publisher. At the 
end of 1917 he was recmited by Dzerzhinsky to go on 
intelligence assignments to Finland under cover as a 
journalist and businessman. Before departing on his first 
mission in January 1918, Filippov gave a written 
undertaking “on a voluntary basis, without receiving 
payment, to pass on all the information which I hear in 
industrial, banking and particularly in conservative 
[nationalist] circles.”^ 

On January 4 Lenin publicly recognized the 
independence of Finland, formerly part of the Tsarist 
Empire, then immediately set about trying to subvert it. A 
putsch at the end of the month by Finnish Communists, 
supported by the Russian military and naval garrison in 
Helsinki, seized control of the capital and much of 
southern Finland. The Communists were quickly 



challenged by a defense corps of Finnish nationalists led 
by the former Tsarist officer General Karl Mannerheim.^ 
Filippov’s main Cheka assignment was to report on 
Mannerheim, his dealings with the Germans, and the 
mood of the sailors who had supported the putsch. Early 
in April 1918, however, German forces intervened in 
Finland, and by the end of the month both the Communist 
putsch and Filippov’s brief career as the first Soviet 
foreign agent were at an end.^ 

DURING THE CIVIL war, which began in May 1918 and 
continued for two and a half years, the Bolshevik regime 
had to fight for its survival against powerful but divided 
White Russian armies. Behind all the forces arraigned 
against them, the Bolshevik leaders saw a vast conspiracy 
orchestrated by Western capitalism. “What we are 
facing,” declared Lenin in July, “is a systematic, 
methodical and evidently long-planned military and 
financial counter-revolutionary campaign against the 
Soviet Republic, which all the representatives of Anglo- 
French imperialism have been preparing for months.”^ In 
reality, though the young Soviet regime had many 
enemies both at home and abroad, there was no carefully 
planned, well coordinated imperialist plot to bring it 
down. The illusion that such a plot existed, however, 
helped to shape the Cheka’s early operations against its 
imperialist foes. 

In the course of the civil war, the Cheka claimed to 



have uncovered and defeated a series of major 
conspiracies by Western governments and their 
intelligence agencies to overthrow the Bolshevik regime. 
The first such conspiracy in the summer of 1918 was the 
“envoys’ plot,” also known as the “Lockhart plot” (after 
its instigator, Robert Bruce Lockhart, a junior British 
diplomat). According to a KGB history published in 1979, 
“One could say without exaggeration that the shattering 
blow dealt by the Chekists to the conspirators was 
equivalent to victory in a major military battle.”^ That is 
what the Cheka had claimed in 1918 and what most of 
Mitrokhin’s colleagues continued to believe over half a 
century later. In reality, however, the “envoys’ plot” was 
mounted not by a coalition of capitalist governments but 
by a group of politically naive Western diplomats and 
adventurous secret agents who were left largely to their 
own devices during the chaotic early months of the 
Bolshevik regime and became involved in farcically inept 
attempts to overthrow it. The best-known of the secret 
agents was Sidney Reilly of the British Secret Intelligence 
Service (then known as Mile), whose exploits oscillated 
between high adventure and low farce, and whose 
increasing tendency to fantasy later led to his exclusion 
from SIS. Reilly announced his arrival in Moscow on 
May 7, 1918 in bizarre but characteristic fashion by 
marching up to the Kremlin gates, announcing that he was 
an emissary from the British prime minister, Lloyd 
George (who had probably never heard of him), and 



unsuccessfully demanding to see Lenin. 

By far the most sophisticated part of the “envoys’ plot” 
was devised not by the envoys themselves or their secret 
agents but by the Cheka, possibly at Lenin’s suggestion, 
as a trap for Western conspirators. In August 1918 the 
Cheka officer Yan Buikis, posing as an anti-Bolshevik 
conspirator named Shmidkhen, succeeded in persuading 
Lockhart, Reilly and the French consul-general that 
Colonel Eduard Berzin, commander of a Latvian regiment 
in the Kremlin (in reality a Cheka agent provocateur), 
was ready to lead an anti-Bolshevik rising. To finance 
Berzin’s proposed coup, Reilly gave him 1,200,000 
roubles which Berzin promptly passed on to the Cheka. 
Reilly’s schemes for the coup varied. At one point he 
imagined himself leading a detachment of Latvian troops 
on to the stage of the Bolshoi Theatre during the Congress 
of Soviets, seizing Lenin, Trotsky and other Bolshevik 
leaders, and shooting them on the spot. ^ ^ However, Reilly 
was also attracted by an alternative scheme not to execute 
Lenin and Trotsky, but instead to remove their trousers, 
parade them in their underpants through the streets of 
Moscow, and so “hold them up to ridicule before the 
world.”^^ 

Reilly’s fantasies however were overtaken by events. 
On August 30 the head of the Petrograd Cheka, Moisei 
Solomonovich Uritsky, was assassinated by a former 
member of the moderate Workers’ Popular Socialist 



Party, Leonid Kannegiser.^^ In an unrelated attack on the 
same day, Lenin was shot and seriously wounded by the 
Socialist Revolutionary, Fanya (Dora) Kaplan. “I shot 
Lenin because I believe him to be a traitor [to 
Socialism],” Kaplan told her Cheka interrogators.^^ In the 
aftermath of both shootings, Dzerzhinsky decided to wind 
up the “envoys’ plot,” which the Cheka itself had been 
largely responsible for orchestrating. On September 2 it 
was announced that the Cheka had “liquidated... the 
conspiracy organized by Anglo-French diplomats... to 
organize the capture of the Council of People’s 
Commissars and the proclamation of military dictatorship 
in Moscow; this was to be done by bribing Soviet troops.” 
Predictably, the statement made no mention of the fact 
that the plan to bribe Soviet troops and stage a military 
coup had been devised by the Cheka itself and that the 
diplomats had been drawn into the conspiracy by agents 
provocateurs relying on Okhrana tradecraft. On 
September 5 Dzerzhinsky and Zinovyev, the Petrograd 
Party boss, issued a further statement declaring that the 
Anglo-French conspirators had been the “organizers” of 
the attempt on Lenin’s life and the “real murderers” of 
Uritsky. Dzerzhinsky did not, however, reveal Reilly’s 
plan to remove Lenin’s and Trotsky’s trousers. Though 
happy to publicize, or invent. Western involvement in 
assassination plots against Lenin, the Cheka dared not 
disclose a plot to hold him up to ridicule. 



The attempt on Lenin’s life, the killing of Uritsky and 
the announcement of the “liquidation” of “the envoys’ 
plot” were quickly followed by the declaration of the Red 
Terror. With the Bolsheviks engaged in a bitter civil war 
against their White enemies, the Cheka set out to terrorize 
the regime’s opponents. Lenin himself, only three weeks 
before the attempt on his own life, had written to the 
Bolsheviks in Penza, and probably elsewhere, urging 
them to organize public executions to make the people 
“tremble” “for hundreds of kilometers around.” While 
still recovering from his wounds, he instructed, “It is 
necessary secretly — and urgently — to prepare the terror.” 

On October 15 Uritsky ’s successor in Petrograd, Gleb 
Ivanovich Boky, proudly reported to Moscow that 800 
alleged counterrevolutionaries had been shot and another 
6,229 imprisoned. Among those arrested, and probably 
executed, in Petrograd was the Cheka’s first foreign 
agent, Alexei Filippov. His liquidation was due, in all 
probability, not to the failure of his Finnish missions but 
to his “bourgeois” origins, which marked him down as an 
enemy of the people in the paranoid atmosphere of the 
Red Terror. Twenty years later Boky was himself to fall 
victim to the even greater paranoia of Stalin’s Terror. 

Berzin and Buikis, the Cheka agents provocateurs who 
had helped orchestrate the “envoys’ plot,” subsequently 
became victims of their own deception. Berzin’s career 
initially prospered. He was awarded the Order of the Red 



Banner for his role as agent provocateur, joined the 
Cheka and later became head of a forced labor camp in 
the Kolyma goldfields which had one of the highest death 
rates in Stalin’s gulag. In 1937, however, he was arrested 
and shot as an enemy of the people. The exact charges 
leveled against Berzin are not known, but it is likely that 
they included accusations that he had actually 
collaborated with Western plotters in 1918. In the 
somewhat paranoid Stalinist interpretation of the “envoys’ 
plot,” his collaborator Buikis (alias “Shmidkhen”) was 
portrayed as a covert counter-revolutionary rather than a 
Cheka officer carrying out his orders. That remained the 
accepted interpretation even in classified KGB histories 
during Mitrokhin’s early career. Buikis survived the 
Terror only by concealing his identity. Not until the mid- 
1960s did research in the KGB archives reestablish 
“Shmidkhen’s” true identity and his real role in 1918.^^ 
Throughout Mitrokhin’s career, KGB historians 
continued to interpret all plots and attacks against the 
young Soviet regime as “manifestations of a unified 
conspiracy” by its class enemies at home and the 
“imperialist powers” abroad.^ ^ The reality was very 
different. Had there been “a unified conspiracy,” the 
regime would surely have lost the civil war. If two or 
three divisions of Western troops had landed in the Gulf 
of Finland in 1919, they could probably have forced their 
way to Moscow and overthrown the Bolsheviks. But in 



the aftermath of the First World War not even two or 
three divisions could be found. Those American, British, 
French and Japanese troops who intervened against the 
Red Army served mainly to discredit the White cause and 
thus actually to assist the Bolsheviks. They were too few 
to affect the military outcome of the civil war but quite 
sufficient to allow the Bolsheviks to brand their 
opponents as the tools of Western imperialism. Most 
Bolsheviks were, in any case, sincerely convinced that 
during the civil war they had faced a determined 
onslaught from the full might of Western capitalism. That 
illusion continued to color Soviet attitudes to the West 
throughout, and even beyond, the Stalin era. 

THE CHEKA’S INTELLIGENCE operations both at 
home and abroad were profoundly influenced not merely 
by the legacy of the Okhrana but also by the Bolsheviks’ 
own pre-Revolutionary experience as a largely illegal 
clandestine underground. Many of the Bolshevik 
leadership had become so used to living under false 
identities before 1917 that they retained their aliases even 
after the Revolution: among them the Russian nobleman 
Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov,^^ who kept the pseudonym 
Lenin, and the Georgian Joseph Vissarionovich 
Dzhugashvili, who continued to be known as Stalin. Both 
Lenin and Stalin retained many of the habits of mind 
developed during their underground existence. On highly 
sensitive matters Lenin would insist no copy be made of 



his instructions and that the original either be returned to 
him for destruction or destroyed by the recipient. Happily 
for the historian, his instructions were not always carried 
out.^^ 

Stalin continued to doctor his own pre-Revolutionary 
record during the 1920s, changing even the day and year 
of his birth; the correct date (December 6, 1878) was not 
made public until 1996.^^ During a visit to the secret 
section of the Moscow Main Archives Directorate 
(Glavarkhiv), Mitrokhin was once shown an Okhrana file 
on Dzhugashvili. The file cover and title followed 
standard Okhrana format, but, on looking inside, 
Mitrokhin discovered that the contents had been entirely 
removed. The probability is that the Okhrana had 
compromising materials on the young Dzhugashvili, and 
that at the first opportunity Stalin arranged for the file to 
be gutted. In typical Soviet bureaucratic fashion, however, 
the cover was preserved since the existence of the file was 
indelibly recorded in the secret registers. Mitrokhin 
suspects that whoever emptied the file, presumably on 
Stalin’s instructions, was later eliminated to preserve the 
dark secret of its missing contents. What Stalin was 
most anxious to destroy may well have been evidence that 
he had been an Okhrana informer. Though it falls well 
short of conclusive proof, a possible trace of that evidence 
still survives. According to reports from an Okhrana agent 
discovered in the State Archive of the Russian Federation, 



Baku Bolsheviks before the First World War “confronted 
Dzhugashvili- Stalin with the accusation that he was a 
provocateur and an agent of the Security Police. And that 
he had embezzled Party funds. 

From almost the beginning of the civil war in 1918, in 
keeping with the Bolshevik tradition of operating under 
false identities, the Cheka began sending officers and 
agents under various disguises and pseudonyms behind 
enemy lines to gather intelligence. By June 1919 the 
number of these “illegals” was sufficiently large to 
require the foundation of an illegals operations 
department (later to become Directorate S of the KGB 
First Chief Directorate).^^ KGB classified histories note 
that henceforth “illegal” operations became “an 
inseparable part of foreign intelligence.” On December 
20, 1920, the third anniversary of the Cheka’s foundation, 
a new foreign department (Innostranyi Otdel or INO) was 
set up to direct all operations beyond Soviet borders. 
During the early years of Soviet Russia, when the 
Communist regime remained an international pariah, it 
had few official missions abroad capable of providing 
official cover for “legal” intelligence stations 
(“residencies” in Cheka jargon) and thus relied chiefly on 
illegals. As diplomatic and trade missions were 
established in foreign capitals, each was given a “legal 
residency” headed by a “residenf’ whose identity was 
officially communicated only to the ambassador or head 
of the mission. Illegals, sometimes grouped in “illegal 



residencies,” operated without the benefit of diplomatic or 
official cover and reported directly to INO in Moscow.^^ 

During the civil war of 1918-20, foreign intelligence 
collection was of minor importance by comparison with 
the Cheka’s role in assisting the victory of the Red Army 
over its White enemies. Like the KGB later, the Cheka 
liked to quantify its successes. In the autumn of 1919, 
probably the turning point in the civil war, it proudly 
claimed that during the first nineteen months of its 
existence it had discovered and neutralized “412 
underground anti-Soviet organizations.”^^ The Cheka’s 
most effective method of dealing with opposition was 
terror. Though its liking of quantification did not extend 
to calculating the number of its victims, it is clear that the 
Cheka enormously outstripped the Okhrana in both the 
scale and the ferocity of its onslaught on political 
opposition. In 1901, 4,113 Russians were in internal exile 
for political crimes, of whom only 180 were on hard 
labor. Executions for political crimes were limited to 
those involved in actual or attempted assassinations. 
During the civil war, by contrast, Cheka executions 
probably numbered as many as 250,000, and may well 
have exceeded the number of deaths in battle. 

At the time of the October Revolution, it had never 
occurred to Lenin that he and the Bolshevik leadership 
would be responsible for the rebirth of the Okhrana in a 
new and far more terrible form. In The State and 



Revolution, which he had almost completed in the 
summer of 1917, he had claimed that there would be no 
need for a police force, let alone a political police, after 
the Revolution. Though it would be necessary to arrange 
for “the suppression of the minority of exploiters by the 
majority of wage slaves of yesterday,” such suppression 
would be “comparatively easy.” The “proletarian 
dictatorship” which would preside over the rapid 
destruction of the bourgeois order would require a 
minimum of rules, regulation and bureaucracy. Lenin had 
never foreseen the possibility of mass opposition to a 
revolution carried out in the name of the people.^ ^ But, 
once in power, he used whatever methods were necessary 
to retain it, claiming always that the Bolsheviks were 
defending “the people’s power” and refusing to accept the 
reality that he had made himself the infallible leader 
(Vozhd) of the world’s first one-party state. 

APPROPRIATELY, THE MEMORIAL erected next to 
the Lubyanka in the closing years of the Soviet era to 
commemorate “the victims of totalitarian repression” 
consists of a large block of granite taken not from Stalin’s 
gulag but from a concentration camp established by Lenin 
on the shores of the White Sea in the autumn of 1918. 
Many Chekists regarded brutality against their class 
enemies as a revolutionary virtue. According to a report 
from the Cheka in Morshansk: 



He who fights for a better future will be merciless 
towards his enemies. He who seeks to protect poor 
people will harden his heart against pity and will 
become cruel. 

Even at a time when the Soviet regime was fighting for its 
survival during the civil war, many of its own supporters 
were sickened by the scale of the Cheka’s brutality. A 
number of Cheka interrogators, some only in their teens,^^ 
employed tortures of scarcely believable barbarity. In 
Kharkhov the skin was peeled off victims’ hands to 
produce “gloves” of human skin; in Voronezh naked 
prisoners were rolled around in barrels studded with nails; 
in Poltava priests were impaled; in Odessa, captured 
White officers were tied to planks and fed slowly into 
furnaces; in Kiev cages of rats were fixed to prisoners’ 
bodies and heated until the rats gnawed their way into the 
victims’ intestines. 

Though Lenin did not approve of such sadism, he was 
content to leave “excesses” to be corrected by 
Dzerzhinsky. Brushing aside complaints of Cheka 
brutality, he paid fulsome tribute to its role in helping to 
win the civil war. The Cheka, he claimed, had proved a 
“devastating weapon against countless conspiracies and 
countless attempts against Soviet power by people who 
are infinitely stronger than us”: 


Gentlemen capitalists of Russia and abroad! We 



know that it is not possible for you to love this 
establishment. Indeed, it is not! [The Cheka] has 
been able to counter your intrigues and your 
machinations as no one else could have done when 
you were smothering us, when you had surrounded 
us with invaders, and when you were organizing 
internal conspiracies and would stop at no crime in 
order to wreck our peaceful work.^^ 

Some of the most secret documents in Dzerzhinsky’s 
archive carry a note that only ten copies were to be made: 
one for Lenin, the rest for Cheka department chiefs. 
Lenin’s absorption in the affairs of the Cheka extended 
even to operational detail. He sent Dzerzhinsky advice on 
how to carry out searches and conduct surveillance, and 
instructed him that arrests were best carried out at night. 
Lenin also took a somewhat naive interest in the 
application of new technology to the hunt for 
counterrevolutionaries, telling Dzerzhinsky to construct a 
large electromagnet capable of detecting hidden weapons 
in house-to-house searches. Though the experiment was 
tried and failed, Dzerzhinsky had some difficulty in 
persuading Lenin that, “Magnets are not much use in 
searches. 

Far more important than Lenin’s sometimes eccentric 
interest in intelligence techniques and technology was his 
belief in the central importance of the Cheka to the 



defense of the Bolshevik one-party state against 
imperialism and counter-revolution. The extent of Lenin’s 
and Dzerzhinsky’s fear of imperialist subversion is well 
illustrated by their deep suspicion of the aid which they 
felt forced to accept in August 1921 from the American 
Relief Association (ARA) to feed millions of starving 
Soviet citizens. Lenin was convinced that the ARA was a 
front for United States intelligence, and ordered the 
closest surveillance of all its members. Once the ARA 
began work, he was equally convinced that it was using 
food as an instrument of subversion. He complained to 
Dzerzhinsky’s deputy, Iosif Stanislavovich Unshlikht, 
that foreign agents were “engaged in massive bribery oj 
hungry and tattered Chekists [Lenin’s emphasis]. The 
danger here is extremely great.” Lenin insisted that urgent 
steps be taken to “feed and clothe the Chekists” in order 
to remove them from imperialist temptation. 

Though the United States still had no peacetime 
espionage agency, the Cheka reported that over 200 of the 
300 ARA staff, who were devoting all their energies to 
dealing with one of the most terrible famines in modem 
European history, were in reality undercover intelligence 
officers who “could become first-class instmctors for a 
counter-revolutionary uprising.” The Cheka also alleged 
that the ARA was building up a large food supply in 
Vienna so that “in the event of a coup [it] could provide 
immediate support to the White government. Lenin 
was far more exercised by the ARA’s non-existent 



intelligence operations than by the approximately five 
million Russians and Ukrainians who starved to death. 
Without the massive aid program of the ARA, which in 
1922 was feeding up to eleven million people a day, the 
famine would have been far worse. Even after the ARA 
had departed, however, Soviet intelligence remained 
convinced that it had been, first and foremost, an 
espionage rather than a humanitarian agency. A quarter of 
a century later, all surviving Russian employees of ARA 
were made to sign confessions that they had been 
American spies. 

The priorities of Soviet intelligence under Lenin, and 
still more under Stalin, continued to be shaped by greatly 
exaggerated beliefs in an unrelenting conspiracy by 
Western governments and their intelligence agencies. To 
understand Soviet intelligence operations between the 
wars, it is frequently necessary to enter a world of smoke 
and mirrors where the target is as much the product of 
Bolshevik delusions as of real counter-revolutionary 
conspiracy. The Soviet propensity to conspiracy theory 
derived both from the nature of the one-party state and 
from its Marxist-Leninist ideology. All authoritarian 
regimes, since they regard opposition as fundamentally 
illegitimate, tend to see their opponents as engaged in 
subversive conspiracy. Bolshevik ideology further 
dictated that capitalist regimes could not fail to be plotting 
the overthrow of the world’s first and only worker- 
peasant state. If they were not visibly preparing an armed 



invasion, then their intelligence agencies must necessarily 
be secretly conspiring to subvert Soviet Russia from 
within. 


INO’S FIRST TWO heads served between them for a 
total of barely eighteen months. The first foreign 
intelligence chief to make his mark was Mikhail 
Abramovich Trilisser, appointed as head of INO in 1922 
— ^undoubtedly with Lenin’s personal approval. Trilisser 
was a Russian Jew who had become a professional 
revolutionary in 1901 at the age of only eighteen. Like 
Dzerzhinsky, he had spent much of his early career in 
exile or in Tsarist prisons. Before the First World War, he 
had specialized in tracking down police spies among 
Bolshevik emigres. While serving with the Cheka in 
1918, he was reputed to have been caught by “bandits” 
and hung from a tree, but to have been cut down just in 
time by Red forces who successfully revived him. Unlike 
any of his successors, Trilisser sometimes traveled abroad 
to meet INO agents. At least until Lenin was 
incapacitated by his third stroke in March 1923, he 
continued to take an active, though sometimes ill- 
informed, interest, in INO reports. He noted, for example, 
that somewhat inaccurate information received in 1922 
from one of the Cheka’s few early British sources, the 
journalist Arthur Ransome (later famous as a children’s 
novelist), was “very important and, probably, 
fundamentally true.”^^ 



The early priorities of INO foreign operations, 
approved by Lenin, were: 

the identification, on the territory of each state, of 

counter-revolutionary groups operating against the 

Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic; 

the thorough study of all organizations engaged in 

espionage against our country; 

the elucidation of the political course of each state 

and its economic situation; 

the acquisition of documentary material on all the 
above requirements.^^ 

The “counter-revolutionary groups” which were of most 
immediate concern to Lenin and the Cheka after the civil 
war were the remnants of the defeated White armies and 
the Ukrainian nationalists. After the last White forces left 
Russian soil late in 1920, they stood no realistic chance of 
mounting another serious challenge to Bolshevik rule. 
That, however, was not Lenin’s view. “A beaten army,” 
he declared, “learns much.” He estimated that there were 
one and a half to two million anti-Bolshevik Russian 
emigres: 

We can observe them all working together 
irrespective of their former political parties... They 
are skillfully taking advantage of every opportunity 
in order, in one way or another, to attack Soviet 



Russia and smash her to pieces ... These counter- 
revolutionary emigres are very well informed, 
excellently organized and good strategists.^^ 

In the early and mid- 1920s INO’s chief target thus 
became the emigre White Guards, based mainly in Berlin, 
Paris and Warsaw, who continued to plot — far less 
effectively than Lenin supposed — the overthrow of the 
Bolshevik regime. 

The other “counter-revolutionary” threat which most 
concerned Lenin and the Bolshevik leadership came from 
Ukrainian nationalists, who had fought both Red and 
White forces in an attempt to win their independence. In 
the winter of 1920 and the spring of 1921 the entire 
Ukrainian countryside was in revolt against Bolshevik 
rule. Even after the brutal “pacification” of Ukraine by the 
Red Army and the Cheka, partisan groups who had taken 
refuge in Poland and Romania continued to make cross- 
border raids.^^ In the spring of 1922 the Ukrainian GPU 
received intelligence reports that Simon Petlyura’s 
Ukrainian govemment-in-exile had established a “partisan 
headquarters” under General Yurko Tutyunnik which was 
sending secret emissaries to the Ukraine to establish a 
nationalist underground.^^ 

The GPU was ordered not merely to collect intelligence 
on the emigre White Guards and Ukrainian nationalists 
but also to penetrate and destabilize them.^^ Its strategy 



was the same against both opponents — to establish bogus 
anti-Bolshevik undergrounds under GPU control which 
could be used to lure General Tutyunnik and the leading 
White generals back across the frontier. 

The first step in enticing Tutyunnik back to Ukraine (an 
operation codenamed CASE 39) was the capture of 
Zayamy, one of his “special duties” officers, who was 
caught crossing the frontier in 1922. Zayamy was 
successfully turned back by the GPU and sent to 
Tutyunnik’ s headquarters with bogus reports that an 
underground Supreme Military Council (Vysshaya 
Voyskovaya Rada or VVR) had been established in 
Ukraine and was anxious to set up an operational 
headquarters under Tutyunnik’ s leadership to wage war 
against the Bolsheviks. Tutyunnik was too cautious to 
return immediately but sent several emissaries who 
attended stage-managed meetings of the VVR, at which 
GPU officers disguised as Ukrainian nationalists reported 
the rapid growth of underground opposition to Bolshevik 
mle and agreed on the urgent need for Tutyunnik’ s 
leadership. Like Zayamy, one of the emissaries, Pyotr 
Stakhov, a close associate of Tutyunnik, was recmited by 
the GPU and used as a double agent. 

Attempts to persuade Tutyunnik himself to return to 
Ukraine finally succeeded on June 26, 1923.^^ Tutyunnik, 
with his bodyguard and aides, arrived at a remote hamlet 
on the Romanian bank of the river Dniester, where 
Zayamy met him with the news that the VVR and Pyotr 



Stakhov were waiting on the other side. At 1 1 p.m. a light 
from the Ukrainian bank signaled that it was safe for 
Tutyunnik and his entourage to cross the river. Still 
cautious, Tutyunnik sent his bodyguard to make sure that 
no trap had been laid for him. Stakhov returned with the 
bodyguard to reassure him. According to an OGPU 
report, Tutyunnik told him, “Pyotr, I know you and you 
know me. We won’t fool each other. The VVR is a 
fiction, isn’t it?” “That is impossible,” Stakhov replied. “I 
know them all, particularly those who are with me 
[today]. You know you can rely on me...” Tutyunnik got 
into the boat with Stakhov and crossed the Dniester. Once 
he was in the hands of the OGPU, letters written by 
Tutyunnik or in his name were sent to prominent 
Ukrainian nationalists abroad saying that their struggle 
was hopeless and that he had aligned himself irrevocably 
with the Soviet cause. He was executed six years later.^^ 

OPERATIONS AGAINST THE White Guards resembled 
those against Ukrainian nationalists. In 1922 the Berlin 
residency recruited the former Tsarist General Zelenin as 
a penetration agent within the emigre community. A later 
OGPU report claimed, possibly with some exaggeration, 
that Zelenin had engineered “a huge schism within the 
ranks of the Whites” and had caused a large number of 
officers to break away from Baron Peter Wrangel, the last 
of the White generals to be defeated in the civil war. 
Other OGPU moles praised for their work in disrupting 



the White Guards included General Zaitsev, former chief 
of staff to the Cossack Ataman A. 1. Dutov, and the ex- 
Tsarist General Yakhontov, who emigrated to the United 
States.^ ^ 

The OGPU’s greatest successes against the White 
Guards, however, were two elaborate deception 
operations, codenamed SINDIKAT (“Syndicate”) and 
TREST (“Trusf ’), both of which made imaginative use of 
agents provocateurs.^^ SINDIKAT was targeted against 
the man believed to be the most dangerous of all the 
White Guards: Boris Savinkov, a former Socialist 
Revolutionary terrorist who had served as deputy minister 
of war in the provisional government overthrown in the 
Bolshevik Revolution. Winston Churchill, among others, 
was captivated by his anti-Bolshevik fervor. “When all is 
said and done,” Churchill wrote later, “and with all the 
stains and tarnishes there be, few men tried more, gave 
more, dared more and suffered more for the Russian 
people.” During the Russo-Polish War of 1920, Savinkov 
was largely responsible for recruiting the Russian 
People’s Army which fought under Polish command 
against the Red Army. Early in 1921 he founded a new 
organization in Warsaw dedicated to the overthrow of the 
Bolshevik regime: the People’s Union for Defence of 
Country and Freedom (NSZRiS), which ran an agent 
network inside Soviet Russia to collect intelligence on the 
Bolsheviks and plan uprisings against the regime. 

The first stage of the operation against Savinkov, 



SINDIKAT-1, successfully neutralized the NSZRiS agent 
network with the help of a Cheka mole within his 
organization. Forty-four leading members of the NSZRiS 
were paraded at a show trial in Moscow in August 1921.^^ 
SINDIKAT-2 was aimed at luring Savinkov back to 
Russia to star in a further show trial and complete the 
demoralization of his emigre supporters. Classified KGB 
histories give the main credit for the operation to the head 
of the OGPU counter-intelligence department, Artur 
Khristyanovich Artuzov (later head of INO), the Russian 
son of an immigrant Swiss-Italian cheesemaker, assisted 
by Andrei Pavlovich Fyodorov and Grigori Sergeyevich 
Syroyezhkin.^^ Though SINDIKAT-2 made skillful use of 
agents provocateurs, however, KGB records fail to 
acknowledge how much they were assisted by Savinkov’ s 
own increasing tendency to fantasize. During a visit to 
London late in 1921 he claimed improbably that the head 
of the Russian trade delegation had suggested that he join 
the Soviet government. Savinkov also alleged that Lloyd 
George and his family had welcomed him at Chequers by 
singing “God Save the Tsar”; in reality, the song was a 
hymn sung in Welsh by a Welsh choir at a pre-Christmas 
celebration. In July 1923 Fedorov, posing as a member of 
an anti-Bolshevik underground, visited Savinkov in Paris, 
where he had installed his headquarters after the collapse 
of the NSZRiS, and persuaded him to send his aide. 
Colonel Sergei Pavlovsky, back to Russia with Fedorov 
for secret talks with the non-existent underground. Once 



in Moscow, Pavlovsky was turned in by the OGPU and 
used to lure Savinkov himself to Russia for further talks. 
On August 15 Savinkov crossed the Russian border with 
some of his supporters and walked straight into an OGPU 
trap. Under OGPU interrogation Savinkov’ s resistance 
swiftly collapsed. At a show trial on August 27 Savinkov 
made an abject confession of his counter-revolutionary 
sins: 


I unconditionally recognize Soviet power and no 
other. To every Russian who loves his country I, 
who have traversed the entire road of this bloody, 
heavy struggle against you, I who refuted you as no 
one else did, I tell you that if you are a Russian, if 
you love your people, you will bow down to worker- 
peasant power and recognize it without any 
reservations.^^ 

The deception of Savinkov continued even after he was 
sentenced to fifteen years in jail. He failed to realize that 
his cellmate, V. I. Speransky, was an OGPU officer, later 
promoted for his success in gaining Savinkov’ s 
confidence and surreptitiously debriefing him over a 
period of eight months. Savinkov did not long survive 
Speransky ’s final report on him. KGB files appear to 
contain no contemporary record of how he met his death. 
According to the SVR’s implausible current version of 
events, Savinkov fell or jumped from an upper-story 



window after a congenial “drinking bout with a group of 
Chekists” — despite a heroic attempt to save him by 
Grigori Syroyezhkin.^^ It seems more likely that 
Syroyezhkin pushed him to his death.^^ 

Even more successful than SINDIKAT was operation 
TREST, the cover name given to a fictitious monarchist 
underground, the Monarchist Association of Central 
Russia (MOR), first invented by Artuzov in 1921 and 
used as the basis of a six-year deception.^^ By 1923 the 
OGPU officer Aleksandr Yakushev, posing as a secret 
MOR member able to travel abroad in his official capacity 
as a Soviet foreign trade representative, had won the 
confidence during visits to Paris of both Grand Duke 
Nikolai Nikolayevich, cousin of the late Tsar Nicholas II, 
and General Aleksandr Kutepov of the [White] Russian 
Combined Services Union (ROVS). The leading victim of 
the deception, however, was the former SIS agent Sidney 
Reilly, an even greater fantasist than Savinkov. Reilly had 
become a tragicomic figure whose hold on reality was 
increasingly uncertain. According to one of his 
secretaries, Eleanor Toye, “Reilly used to suffer from 
severe mental crises amounting to delusion. Once he 
thought he was Jesus Christ.” The OGPU, however, failed 
to grasp that Reilly was now of little significance, 
regarding him instead as a British masterspy and one of 
its most dangerous opponents. On September 26, 1925 it 
succeeded in luring him, like Savinkov a year before. 



across the Russian frontier to a meeting with bogus MOR 
conspirators.^^ 

Reilly’s resistance after his arrest did not last much 
longer than Savinkov’s. His KGB file contains a letter, 
probably authentic, to Dzerzhinsky dated October 30, 
1925, in which he promised to reveal all he knew about 
British and American intelligence as well as Russian 
emigres in the West. Six days later Reilly was taken for a 
walk in the woods near Moscow and, without warning, 
shot from behind. According to an OGPU report, he “let 
out a deep breath and fell without a cry.” Among those 
who accompanied him on his final walk in the woods was 
Grigori Syroyezhkin, the probable assassin of Savinkov a 
year earlier. Reilly’s corpse was put on private display in 
the Lubyanka sickbay to allow OGPU officers to 
celebrate their triumph.^ ^ Appropriately for a career in 
which myth and reality had become inextricably 
confused, rumors circulated for many years in the West 
that Reilly had escaped execution and adopted a new 
identity. The TREST deception was finally exposed in 
1927, to the embarrassment of the intelligence services of 
Britain, France, Poland, Finland and the Baltic states who 
had all, in varying degrees, been taken in by it.^^ 

AS WEFF AS engaging in permanent conflict with 
counter-revolution, both real and imagined, Soviet 
intelligence between the wars also became increasingly 



successful in penetrating the main imperialist powers. It 
had two major operational advantages over Western 
intelligence agencies. First, while security in Moscow 
became obsessional, much Western security remained 
feeble. Secondly, the Communist parties and their “fellow 
travelers” in the West gave Soviet intelligence a major 
source of ideological recruits of which it took increasing 
advantage. 

While operation TREST was at its height, INO, the 
OGPU’s foreign intelligence service, succeeded in 
making its first major penetration of the British foreign 
service. The penetration agent was an Italian messenger in 
the British embassy in Rome, Francesco Constantini 
(codenamed DUNCAN), who was recruited in 1924 by 
the OGPU residency with the help of an Italian 
Communist, Alfredo Allegretti, who had worked as a 
Russian embassy clerk before the Revolution. Despite his 
lowly status, Constantini had access to a remarkable range 
of diplomatic secrets. Until the Second World War, the 
Foreign Office did not possess a single security officer, let 
alone a security department. Security in many British 
embassies was remarkably lax. In Rome, according to Sir 
Andrew Noble, who was stationed at the embassy in the 
mid- 1930s, it was “virtually non-existent.” Embassy 
servants had access to the keys to red boxes and filing 
cabinets containing classified documents, as well as — 
probably — the number of the combination lock on the 
embassy safe. Even when two copies of a diplomatic 



cipher were missing in 1925, it did not occur to British 
diplomats that they might have been removed by 
Constantini — as they almost certainly were.^^ 

For more than a decade Francesco Constantini handed 
over a great variety of diplomatic documents and cipher 
material. Probably from an early stage he also involved 
his brother, Secondo, who worked as an embassy servant, 
in the theft of documents. In addition to despatches on 
Anglo-Italian relations exchanged between London and 
the Rome embassy, Constantini was often able to supply 
the “confidential print” of selected documents from the 
Foreign Office and major British missions designed to 
give ambassadors an overview of current foreign policy. 
By January 1925 he was providing, on average, 150 pages 
of classified material a week. Constantini made no secret 
of his motives. The Rome residency reported to the 
Centre, “He collaborates with us exclusively for money, 
and does not conceal the fact. He has set himself the goal 
of becoming a rich man, and that is what he strives for.” 
In 1925 the Centre pronounced Constantini its most 
valuable agent. Convinced of a vast, nonexistent British 
plot to destroy the Soviet state, it counted on agent 
DUNCAN to provide early warning of a British attack, 
and instructed the Rome residency: 

England is now the organizing force behind a 
probable attack on the USSR in the near future. A 
continuous hostile cordon [of states] is being formed 



against us in the West. In the East, in Persia, 
Afghanistan and China we observe a similar picture 
... Your task (and consider it a priority) is to provide 
documentary and agent materials which reveal the 
details of the English plan. 

The Rome residency’s pride in running the OGPU’s 
leading agent is reflected in its flattering descriptions of 
him. Constantini was said to have the face of “an ancient 
Roman,” and to be known to his many female admirers as 
“the handsome one.”^^ By 1928 the OGPU suspected him 
— accurately — of also supplying documents to Italian 
intelligence. Despite suspicions about Constantini ’s 
honesty, however, there was no mistaking the importance 
of the material he supplied. Maksim Litvinov, who by the 
late 1920s was the dominating figure in the People’s 
Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, pronounced it “of great 
use to me.”^^ 

THE OGPU’S FIRST successful penetration of the 
British foreign service was overshadowed in 1927 by an 
embarrassing series of well-publicized intelligence 
failures. The security of the rapidly expanding foreign 
network of OGPU and Fourth Department (Military 
Intelligence) residencies was threatened by the 
vulnerability of early Soviet cipher systems to Western 
cryptanalysts, by the inexperience of some of the first 
generation of INO officers, and by errors in the selection 



and training of foreign Communists as agents. The 
International Liaison Department (OMS) of the 
Communist International provided a ready pool of 
enthusiastic volunteers for Soviet intelligence operations. 
Some, such as the German Richard Sorge, were to be 
numbered among the greatest spies of the century. Others 
ignored orthodox tradecraft and neglected standard 
security procedures. 

In the spring of 1927 there were dramatic revelations of 
Soviet espionage in eight different countries. In March a 
major OGPU spy ring was uncovered in Poland; a Soviet 
trade official was arrested for espionage in Turkey; and 
the Swiss police announced the arrest of two Russian 
spies. In April a police raid on the Soviet consulate in 
Beijing uncovered a mass of incriminating intelligence 
documents; and the French Surete, arrested members of a 
Soviet spy ring in Paris run by Jean Cremet, a leading 
French Communist. In May Austrian foreign ministry 
officials were found passing classified information to the 
OGPU residency, and the British Home Secretary 
indignantly announced to the House of Commons the 
discovery of “one of the most complete and one of the 
most nefarious spy systems that it has ever been my lot to 
meet.”^^ 

Following this last discovery, Britain — still regarded in 
the Soviet Union as the leading world power and its most 
dangerous enemy — formally broke off diplomatic 
relations, and senior ministers read out to the Commons 



decrypted extracts from intercepted Soviet telegrams. To 
tighten the security of Soviet diplomatic and OGPU 
communications after the dramatic revelation of British 
codebreaking successes, the laborious but virtually 
unbreakable “one-time pad” cipher system was 
introduced. As a result, Western cryptanalysts were able 
to decrypt almost no further high-grade Soviet 
communications until after the Second World War.^^ 

THE MOST WORRYSOME as well as the most plentiful 
foreign intelligence in 1927 concerned Japan. Since 1925 
INO had been able to intercept the secret communications 
of both Japan’s military mission and its consulate-general 
in the northeast Chinese city of Harbin. Remarkably, 
instead of using diplomatic bags and their own couriers, 
Japanese official representatives in Harbin corresponded 
with Tokyo via the Chinese postal service. The OGPU 
recruited the Chinese employees who were used to take 
Japanese official despatches to the Harbin post office, and 
sent expert teams of letter-openers to examine and 
photograph the despatches, before sending them on their 
way in new envelopes with copies of Japanese seals. 
Professor Matsokin, a Japanese specialist from 
Moscow,^^ was employed by INO in Harbin to peruse the 
despatches and send translations of the most important 
promptly to the Centre. There was ample evidence in the 
intercepts forwarded to Moscow of designs by the 
Japanese military on China and the Soviet Far East. But 



the most troubling document, intercepted in July 1927, 
was a secret memorandum written by Baron Gi-ishi 
Tanaka, the Japanese prime minister and foreign minister, 
which advocated the conquest of Manchuria and 
Mongolia as a prelude to Japanese domination over the 
whole of China, and predicted that Japan “would once 
again have to cross swords with Russia.”^ ^ 

A second copy of the memorandum was obtained in 
Japanese-occupied Korea by the residency at Seoul, 
headed by Ivan Andreevich Chichayev (later wartime 
resident in London). A Japanese interpreter, codenamed 
ANO, recruited by the INO residency, succeeded in 
extracting the document, along with other secret material, 
from the safe of the Japanese police chief in Seoul. A 
copy of the Tanaka memorandum was later leaked by 
INO to the American press to give the impression that it 
had been obtained by an agent working for the United 
States. As recently as 1997 an SVR official history 
continued to celebrate the simultaneous acquisition of the 
memorandum in Harbin and Seoul as “an absolutely 
unique occurrence in intelligence operations. Though 
somewhat exaggerated, this judgment accurately reflects 
the enormous importance attached at the time to the 
discovery of Tanaka’s prediction of war with Russia. 

The acute anxiety in Moscow caused by the breach of 
diplomatic relations with Britain and the apparent threat 
from Japan was clearly reflected in an alarmist article by 



Stalin, published a few days after he received the Tanaka 
memorandum: 

IT IS HARDLY open to doubt that the chief 
contemporary question is that of the threat of a new 
imperialist war. It is not a question of some 
indefinite and immaterial “danger” of a new war. It 
is a matter of a real and material threat of a new war 
in general, and war against the USSR in particular.^^ 

The fact that Constantini had failed to provide anything 
remotely resembling a British version of the Tanaka 
memorandum did not lead either Stalin or the conspiracy 
theorists of the Centre to conclude that Britain had no 
plans to attack the Soviet Union. They believed instead 
that greater efforts were required to penetrate the secret 
councils of the Western warmongers. Stalin, who had 
emerged as the clear victor in the three-year power 
struggle which followed Lenin’s death, demanded more 
intelligence on the (mostly imaginary) Western plots 
against the Soviet Union which he was sure existed. 

In an effort to make Soviet espionage less detectable 
and more deniable, the main responsibility for intelligence 
collection was shifted from “legal” to “illegal” 
residencies, which operated independently of Soviet 
diplomatic and trade missions. In later years the 
establishment of a new illegal residency became an 
immensely timeconsuming operation which involved 



years of detailed training and the painstaking construction 
of “legends” to give the illegals false identities. The 
largely improvised attempt to expand the illegal network 
rapidly in the late 1920s and early 1930s, without the 
detailed preparation which later became mandatory, 
brought into OGPU foreign operations both 
unconventional talent and a number of confidence 
tricksters. Among the secret scandals discovered by 
Mitrokhin in KGB files was that of the illegal residency 
established in Berlin in 1927 with the Austrian Bertold 
Karl Ilk as resident and Moritz Weinstein as his deputy. A 
later investigation concluded that the Centre should have 
noted the “suspicious speed” with which the Ilk- 
Weinstein residency claimed to be expanding its agent 
network. Within two months it was reporting operations 
in Britain, France and Poland as well as in Germany. Ilk 
refused to provide more than sketchy information on his 
agents’ identity on security grounds. His failure to supply 
detailed biographies was reluctantly accepted by the 
Centre, which was still reeling from the widespread 
unmasking of OGPU networks in the spring of 1927. It 
gradually became clear, however, that the core of the Ilk- 
Weinstein illegal network consisted of their own relatives 
and that some elements of it were pure invention. Its 
agent operations in Britain and France were discovered to 
be “plain bluff,” though an effective way of obtaining 
funds from the Centre for Ilk and Weinstein. The network 
in Germany and Poland, while not wholly fictitious, was 



under surveillance by the local police and security 
services. The Centre closed down the entire residency in 
1933, though without attracting the publicity occasioned 
by the intelligence failures of 1927.^^ 

THE MAIN INFLUENCE on the evolution of the OGPU 
and its successors during the Stalinist era was the change 
in the nature of the Soviet state. Much of what was later 
called “Stalinism” was in reality the creation of Lenin: the 
cult of the infallible leader, the one-party state and a huge 
security service with a ubiquitous system of surveillance 
and a network of concentration camps to terrorize the 
regime’s opponents. But while Lenin’s one-party state left 
room for comradely debate within the ruling party, Stalin 
used the OGPU to stifle that debate, enforce his own 
narrow orthodoxy and pursue vendettas against opponents 
both real and imagined. The most vicious and long-lasting 
of those vendettas was against Leon Trotsky, Lenin’s 
former Commissar for War. 

In its early stages at least, the OGPU’s campaign 
against Trotsky and his supporters was characterized by a 
bizarre combination of brutality and farce. When Trotsky 
refused to recant and admit his “crimes against the Party,” 
he was sent into internal exile at Alma-Ata, a town in a 
remote comer of Kazakhstan on the Chinese border. The 
OGPU detachment which came to his Moscow flat on the 
morning of January 17, 1928 to take him into exile found 
Trotsky still in his pajamas. When he refused to come out. 



the OGPU broke down the door. Trotsky was surprised to 
recognize the officer leading the detachment as one of his 
former bodyguards from the civil war. Overcome with 
emotion at the sight of the ex-Commissar for War, the 
officer broke down and sobbed, “Shoot me. Comrade 
Trotsky, shoot me.” Trotsky calmed him down, told him it 
was his duty to obey orders however reprehensible, and 
adopted a posture of passive resistance while the OGPU 
removed his pajamas, put on his clothes and carried him 
to a car waiting to transport him to the Trans-Siberian 
Express. 

Save for a few hunting trips, Trotsky spent most of his 
time in Alma-Ata at his desk. Between April and October 
1928 he sent his supporters about 550 telegrams and 800 
“political letters,” some of them lengthy polemical tracts. 
During the same period he received 700 telegrams and 
1,000 letters from various parts of the Soviet Union, but 
believed that at least as many more had been confiscated 
en route. Every item in Trotsky’s intercepted 
correspondence was carefully noted by the OGPU, and 
monthly digests of them were sent both to Vyacheslav 
Rudolfovich Menzhinsky (Dzerzhinsky’s successor) and 
to Stalin. Stalin, who never failed to overreact to 
opposition, cannot but have been unfavorably impressed 
by letters which regularly described him and his 
supporters as “degenerates.” 

OGPU reports on Trotsky and his followers were 



written in a tone of selfrighteous outrage. No counter- 
revolutionary group since the October Revolution, it 
declared, had dared to behave “as insolently, boldly and 
defiantly” as the Trotskyists. Even when brought in for 
interrogation, Trotsky’s supporters refused to be 
intimidated by their interrogators. Most declined to reply 
to questions. Instead they submitted impudent written 
protests, such as: “I consider the struggle I am engaged in 
to be a Party matter. I shall explain myself to the Central 
Control Commission, not to the OGPU.” Early in 1928 
the OGPU carried out its first mass arrests of Trotskyists, 
incarcerating several hundred of them in Moscow’s 
Butyrka prison. The Butyrka, however, had not yet 
descended into the brutal squalor for which it became 
infamous during the Great Terror a decade later, nor had 
the spirit of Trotsky’s followers been broken. On their 
first night in prison the Trotskyists staged a riot, kicking 
down doors, breaking windows and chanting politically 
incorrect slogans. “Such,” reported the OGPU 
indignantly, “was the behavior of the embittered enemies 
of the Party and Soviet power. 

The liquidation of the Trotskyist heresy and the 
maintenance of ideological orthodoxy within the 
Communist one-party state required, in Stalin’s view, 
Trotsky’s removal from the Soviet Union. In February 
1929 the great heretic was deported to Turkey and given 
1,500 dollars by an OGPU escort to enable him to “settle 
abroad.”^ ^ With Trotsky out of the country, the tone of 



OGPU reports on the destabilization and liquidation of his 
rapidly dwindling band of increasingly demoralized 
followers became more confident. According to one 
report, “a massive retreat from Trotskyism began in the 
second half of 1929.” Some of those who recanted were 
turned into OGPU agents to inform on their friends. The 
same report boasts of the subtlety of the methods used to 
undermine the credibility of the “counter-revolutionary” 
hard core. Individual Trotskyists were summoned to 
OGPU offices from their workplaces, left standing around 
in the corridors for several hours, then released without 
explanation. On returning to work they could give no 
credible account of what had happened. When the process 
was repeated their workmates became increasingly 
suspicious and tended to believe rumors planted by the 
OGPU that they were employed by them as informers. 
Once the “counter-revolutionaries” were discredited, they 
were then arrested for their political crimes. 

Stalin, however, was far from reassured. He 
increasingly regretted the decision to send Trotsky abroad 
rather than keep him in the Soviet Union, where he could 
have been put under constant surveillance. One episode 
only six months after Trotsky was sent into exile seems to 
have made a particular impression on Stalin. In the 
summer of 1929 Trotsky received a secret visit from a 
sympathizer within the OGPU, Yakov Blyumkin. As a 
young and impetuous Socialist Revolutionary in the 
Cheka in 1918, Blyumkin had assassinated the German 



ambassador in defiance of orders from Dzerzhinsky. With 
Trotsky’s help, however, he had been rehabilitated and 
had risen to become chief illegal resident in the Middle 
East. Blyumkin agreed to transmit a message from 
Trotsky to Karl Radek, one of his most important former 
supporters, and to try to set up lines of communication 
with what Trotsky termed his “cothinkers” in the Soviet 
Union. Trilisser, the head of foreign intelligence, was 
probably alerted to Blyumkin’s visit by an OGPU agent in 
Trotsky’s entourage. He did not, however, order 
Blyumkin’s immediate arrest. Instead he arranged an 
early version of what later became known as a “honey 
trap.” Trilisser instructed an attractive OGPU agent, 
Yelizaveta Yulyevna Gorskaya (better known as “Lisa,” 
or “Vixen”), to “abandon bourgeois prejudices,” seduce 
Blyumkin, discover the full extent of his collaboration 
with Trotsky, and ensure his return to the Soviet Union. 
Once lured back to Moscow, Blyumkin was interrogated, 
tried in secret and shot. According to the later OGPU 
defector Aleksandr Mikhailovich Orlov, Blyumkin’s last 
words before his execution were, “Long live Trotsky!” 
Soon afterwards “Lisa” Gorskaya married the OGPU 
resident in Berlin (and later in New York), Vasili 
Mikhailovich Zarubin. 

As Stalin became increasingly preoccupied during the 
early 1930s with the opposition to him within the 
Communist Party, he began to fear that there were other. 



undiscovered Blyumkins within INO. But Trotsky himself 
had not yet been targeted for assassination. The main 
“enemies of the people” outside the Soviet Union were 
still considered to be the White Guards. General Kutepov, 
the head of the ROVS in Paris, was brave, upright, 
teetotal, politically naive and an easy target for the 
OGPU. His entourage was skillfully penetrated by Soviet 
agents, and agents provocateurs brought him optimistic 
news of a nonexistent anti-Bolshevik underground. “Great 
movements are spreading across Russia!” Kutepov 
declared in November 1929. “Never have so many people 
come from ‘over there’ to see me and ask me to 
collaborate with their clandestine organizations.” Unlike 
Savinkov and Reilly, however, Kutepov resisted attempts 
to lure him back to Russia for meetings with the bogus 
anti-Communist conspirators. With Stalin’s approval, the 
OGPU thus decided to kidnap him instead and bring him 
back for interrogation and execution in Moscow. 

Overall planning of the Kutepov operation was given to 
Yakov Isaakovich (“Yasha”) Serebryansky, head of the 
euphemistically titled “Administration for Special 
Tasks. Before the Second World War, the 
administration functioned as a parallel foreign intelligence 
service, reporting directly to the Centre with special 
responsibility for sabotage, abduction and assassination 
operations on foreign soil.^^ Serebryansky later became a 
severe embarrassment to official historians anxious to 



distance Soviet foreign intelligence from the blood-letting 
of the late 1930s and portray it as a victim rather than a 
perpetrator of the Great Terror. An SVR- sponsored 
history published in 1993 claimed that Serebryansky was 
“not a regular member of State Security,” but “only 
brought in for special jobs. KGB files show that, on the 
contrary, he was a senior OGPU officer whose 
Administration for Special Tasks grew into an elite 
service, more than 200-strong, dedicated to hunting down 
“enemies of the people” on both sides of the Atlantic. 

Detailed preparations for the kidnaping of Kutepov 
were entrusted by Serebryansky to his illegal Paris 
resident, V. I. Speransky, who had taken part in the 
deception of Savinkov six years earlier.^ ^ On the morning 
of Sunday, January 26, 1930 Kutepov was bundled into a 
taxi in the middle of a street in Paris’s fashionable seventh 
arrondissement. Standing nearby was a Communist Paris 
policeman who had been asked to assist by Speransky so 
that any bystander who saw the kidnaping (one did) 
would mistake it for a police arrest. Though the Centre 
commended the kidnaping as “a brilliant operation,” the 
chloroform used to overpower Kutepov proved too much 
for the general’s weak heart. He died aboard a Soviet 
steamer while being taken back to Russia. 

The Kutepov operation was to set an important 
precedent. In the early and mid- 1930s the chief Soviet 
foreign intelligence priority remained intelligence 



collection. During the later years of the decade, however, 
all other operations were to be subordinated to “special 
tasks.” 



THREE 


THE GREAT ILLEGALS 


On January 30, 1930 the Politburo (effectively the ruling 
body of both the Party and the Soviet Union) met to 
review INO operations and ordered it to increase 
intelligence collection in three target areas: Britain, 
France and Germany (the leading European powers); the 
Soviet Union’s western neighbors, Poland, Romania, 
Finland and the Baltic states; and Japan, its main Asian 
rival. ^ The United States, which established diplomatic 
relations with the Soviet Union only in 1933, was not 
mentioned. Though the first Soviet illegal had been sent 
across the Atlantic as early as 1921,^ the USA’s relative 
isolation from world affairs made American intelligence 
collection still a secondary priority.^ 

On Politburo instructions, the main expansion of INO 
operations was achieved through increasing the number of 
illegal residencies, each with up to seven (in a few cases 
as many as nine) illegal officers. By contrast, even in 
Britain and France legal residencies operating under 
diplomatic cover in Soviet embassies had three officers at 
most and sometimes only one. Their main function was to 



provide channels of communications with the Centre and 
other technical support for the more highly regarded 
illegals.^ During the 1920s both legal and illegal 
residencies had had the right to decide what agents to 
recruit and how to recruit them. On succeeding Trilisser 
as head of INO in 1930, however, Artur Artuzov, the hero 
of the SINDIKAT and TREST operations, complained 
that the existing agent network contained “undesirable 
elements.” He decreed that future agent recruitment 
required the authorization of the Centre. Partly because of 
problems of communication, his instructions were not 
always carried out.^ 

The early and mid- 1930s were to be remembered in the 
history of Soviet foreign intelligence as the era of the 
“Great Illegals,” a diverse group of remarkably talented 
individuals who collectively transformed OGPU agent 
recruitment and intelligence collection. Post-war illegals 
had to endure long training periods designed to establish 
their bogus identities, protect their cover and prepare them 
for operations in the West. Their pre-war predecessors 
were successful partly because they had greater freedom 
from bureaucratic routine and more opportunity to use 
their own initiative. But they also had to contend with far 
softer targets than their successors. By the standards of 
the Cold War, most inter- war Western security systems 
were primitive. The individual flair of the Great Illegals 
combined with the relative vulnerability of their targets to 
give some of their operations a much more unorthodox, at 



times even eccentric, character than those of the Cold 
War. 

Some of the ablest of the Great Illegals were not 
Russians at all, but cosmopolitan, multilingual Central 
Europeans who had worked in the Comintern 
underground before joining the OGPU and shared a 
visionary faith in the Communist millennium.^ Arnold 
Deutsch, the chief recruiter of students and young 
graduates at Cambridge University (discussed in chapter 
4), was an Austrian Jew. The most successful of the 
Fourth Department (Military Intelligence) illegals was the 
German Richard Sorge, later described by one of his 
Comintern admirers as a “startlingly good-looking ... 
romantic, idealistic scholar,” who exuded charm. ^ While 
Surge’s main successes were achieved posing as a Nazi 
journalist in Japan, those of the OGPU/NKVD illegals 
mostly took place in Europe. 

Though the Great Illegals are nowadays best 
remembered, particularly in Britain, for their recruitment 
of young, talented, ideological agents, their first major 
successes were the less glamorous but scarcely less 
important acquisition of diplomatic ciphers and 
documents from agents motivated by money and sex 
rather than ideology. Codebreaking is often supposed to 
depend on little more than the cryptanalytic genius of 
brilliant mathematicians, nowadays assisted by huge 
networks of computers. In reality, most major twentieth- 
century codebreaking coups on which information is 



available have been assisted — sometimes crucially — ^by 
agent intelligence on code and cipher systems. Tsarist 
codebreakers had led the world chiefly because of their 
skill in stealing or purchasing the codes and ciphers of 
foreign powers. Ten years before the First World War the 
British ambassador in St. Petersburg, Sir Charles 
Hardinge, discovered that his head Chancery servant had 
been offered the then enormous sum of 1,000 pounds to 
steal the embassy’s main cipher. Though the Okhrana 
failed on this occasion, it succeeded on many others. 
Hardinge was disconcerted to be told by a Russian 
statesman that he “did not mind how much I reported in 
writing what he had told me in conversation, but he 
begged me on no account to telegraph as all our 
[ciphered] telegrams are known!” The Okhrana became 
the first modem intelligence service to make one of its 
major priorities the theft of foreign ciphers to assist its 
codebreakers. In so doing it set an important precedent for 
its Soviet successors.^ 

Research on the making of Stalin’s foreign policy has, 
as yet, barely begun to take account of the large volume 
of Western diplomatic traffic which the Great Illegals and 
the codebreakers were instmmental in providing. 

THE DOCUMENTS OBTAINED from Francesco 
Constantini in the British embassy in Rome from 1924 
onwards included important cipher material.^ KGB 
records, however, give the main credit for the OGPU’s 



early successes in obtaining foreign diplomatic ciphers to 
the most flamboyant of the Great Illegals, Dmitri 
Aleksandrovich Bystroletov, codenamed HANS or 
ANDREI, who operated abroad under a series of aliases, 
including several bogus titles of nobility. His was one of 
the portraits of the leading heroes of foreign intelligence 
later chosen to hang on the walls of the secret “memory 
room” at the KGB First Chief (Foreign Intelligence) 
Directorate in Yasenevo (now the headquarters of the 
SVR). Bystroletov was a strikingly handsome, 
multilingual extrovert, bom in 1901, the illegitimate son 
of a Kuban Cossack mother and — Bystroletov later 
persuaded himself — the celebrated novelist Aleksei 
Tolstoy. 

A hagiography of Bystroletov’ s career published by the 
SVR in 1995 unsurprisingly fails to mention either his 
fantasy about the identity of his father or the fact that one 
of his first claims to fame within the OGPU was the 
seduction of female staff with access to classified 
documents in foreign embassies and ministries: a 
technique later employed on a larger scale by Soviet Bloc 
intelligence agencies in operations such as the “secretaries 
offensive” in West Germany. A report noted by Mitrokhin 
quaintly records that Bystroletov “quickly became on 
close terms with women and shared their beds.” His first 
major conquest for the OGPU occurred in Prague, where 
in 1927 he seduced a 29-year-old woman in the French 



embassy whom the OGPU codenamed LAROCHE. 
Over the next two years LAROCHE gave Bystroletov 
copies of both French diplomatic ciphers and classified 
communications. 

Bystroletov ’s unconventional flamboyance may help to 
explain why he never achieved officer rank in Soviet 
intelligence and remained simply an illegal agent/^ 
attached in the early 1920s and late 1930s to the illegal 
Berlin residency of Boris Bazarov (codenamed KIN).^^ 
Unlike Bystroletov, more conventional OGPU officers 
missed a number of opportunities to recruit agents with 
access to diplomatic ciphers. One such opportunity, which 
later led to a personal rebuke by Stalin to the OGPU 
personnel responsible, occurred in Paris in August 1928. 
A stranger, later identified as the Swiss businessman and 
adventurer Giovanni de Ry (codenamed ROSSI), 
presented himself at the Soviet embassy and asked to see 
the military attache, or the first secretary. According to 
a later account by Bystroletov based on an embassy 
report, de Ry was a short man whose red nose contrasted 
colorfully with his yellow briefcase. He allegedly told 
the OGPU resident, Vladimir Voynovich:^^ 

This briefcase contains the codes and ciphers of 
Italy. You, no doubt, have copies of the ciphered 
telegrams of the local Italian embassy. Take the 
briefcase and check the authenticity of its contents. 



Once you have satisfied yourself that they are 
genuine, photograph them and give me 200,000 
French francs. 

De Ry also offered to provide future Italian diplomatic 
ciphers for a similar sum. Voynovich took the ciphers into 
a back room, where they were photographed by his wife. 
He then returned the originals to de Ry, denounced them 
as forgeries, ordered him out of the embassy and 
threatened to call the police. Though the Centre later 
changed its mind, at the time it commended Voynovich 
for his astuteness in obtaining Italian ciphers at no cost to 
theOGPU.19 

Exactly a year later, in August 1929, there was another, 
similar walk-in at the Paris embassy. On this occasion the 
visitor was a cipher clerk from the Foreign Office 
Communications Department, Ernest Holloway Oldham, 
then accompanying a British trade delegation in Paris. 
Voynovich seems to have tried to repeat the deception 
practiced on de Ry a year earlier. Oldham, however, was 
more cautious than de Ry, brought no cipher material with 
him, tried to prevent his identity being discovered and 
sought to limit his contact with the OGPU to a single 
transaction. He identified himself only as “Charlie,” 
misled Voynovich by claiming to work in the Foreign 
Office printing department, and announced that he could 
obtain a copy of the British diplomatic cipher. Oldham 
asked for 50,000 pounds, Voynovich beat him down to 



10,000 pounds and they agreed on a meeting in Berlin 
early the following year.^^ 

Before that meeting took place, the work of the Paris 
embassy and OGPU residency was disrupted by the 
defection of the Soviet charge d’affaires, Grigori 
Besedovsky, in October 1929. Accused of counter- 
revolutionary “plotting,” Besedovsky made a dramatic 
escape over the embassy wall, pursued by OGPU guards 
who had orders to return him to Moscow for interrogation 
and, almost certainly, execution. Besedovsky ’s memoirs, 
published in 1930, caused outrage in the Centre. They 
denounced Stalin as “the embodiment of the most 
senseless type of oriental despotism,” and revealed a 
number of OGPU secrets: among them the offers of 
Italian and British ciphers to the Paris residency by 
unidentified walk-ins.^ ^ 

These revelations led to Bystroletov’s urgent recall to 
Moscow. At the Lubyanka, Abram Aronovich Slutsky 
(later head of foreign intelligence) showed him a copy of 
Besedovsky’ s memoirs. Opposite the reference to the 
deception of de Ry, the unidentified walk-in who had 
provided Italian ciphers in 1928, the instruction 
“Reopen!” had been penciled in the margin by Stalin 
himself Slutsky instructed Bystroletov to return to Paris 
at once, discover the identity of the walk-in swindled two 
years earlier, renew contact and obtain further ciphers 
from him. “Where can I find him?” Bystroletov asked. 
“That’s your business,” Slutsky replied. “You have six 



months to track him down.”^^ 

Bystroletov ran de Ry to ground in a Geneva bar. 
Believing that, after the fraud practiced on him in Paris 
two years earlier, de Ry might reject an approach from the 
OGPU, Bystroletov decided to use what later became 
known as the “false flag” technique and pretended to be 
working for the Japanese intelligence service. Though de 
Ry was not deceived for long by the “false flag,” he 
agreed to sell further Italian ciphers which he claimed to 
be able to obtain from a corrupt Italian diplomat. Future 
meetings with de Ry usually took place in Berlin, where 
the diplomat was allegedly stationed. KGB records, 
possibly incomplete, show that de Ry was paid at least 
200,000 French francs. 

Bystroletov was also given the task of tracing the 
unidentified British walk-in (Ernest Oldham) who had 
offered to sell Foreign Office ciphers to the Paris 
residency. In April 1930, at the meeting arranged in the 
previous year, Oldham (codenamed ARNO by the OGPU) 
handed over only part of a diplomatic cipher, probably as 
a precaution against being double-crossed, and demanded 
a 6,000-dollar down-payment before providing the rest. 
The OGPU tried to locate him after the meeting but 
discovered that he had given a false address.^^ 

Probably soon after his first meeting with de Ry, 
Bystroletov succeeded in tracking down Oldham in a 
Paris bar, struck up a conversation with him, won his 



confidence and booked into the hotel where he was 
staying. There Bystroletov revealed himself to Oldham 
and his wife Lucy as an impoverished Hungarian 
aristocrat who had fallen, like Oldham, into the clutches 
of Soviet intelligence. With his wife’s approval, Oldham 
agreed to provide Foreign Office ciphers and other 
classified documents to Bystroletov to pass on to the 
OGPU. Oldham was given a first payment of 6,000 
dollars, a second of 5,000 dollars, then 1,000 dollars a 
month. Bystroletov portrayed himself throughout as a 
sympathetic friend, visiting the Oldhams on several 
occasions at their London home in Pembroke Gardens, 
Kensington. Oldham’s documents, however, were handed 
over at meetings in France and Germany. 

Having originally tried to hold the OGPU at arm’s 
length, Oldham became increasingly nervous about the 
risks of working as a Soviet agent. In order to put pressure 
on him, Bystroletov was accompanied to several of their 
meetings by the head of the illegal residency in Berlin, 
Boris Bazarov (codenamed KIN), who posed as a rather 
menacing Italian Communist named da Vinci. With 
Bazarov and Bystroletov playing the hard man/soft man 
routine, Oldham agreed to continue but took increasingly 
to drink. Bystroletov strengthened his hold over Lucy 
Oldham (henceforth codenamed MADAM) by putting his 
relationship with her on what an OGPU report coyly 
describes as “an intimate footing. 

Though Bystroletov successfully deceived the 



Oldhams, he seems to have been unaware that the 
Oldhams were also deceiving him. At their first meeting, 
Oldham explained that he was “a lord, who worked out 
ciphers for the Foreign Office and was a very influential 
person,” rather than, in reality, a minor functionary. At 
later meetings Oldham claimed that he traveled abroad on 
a diplomatic passport illegally provided for him by a 
Foreign Office friend named Kemp whom he alleged, 
almost certainly falsely, was in the Secret Intelligence 
Service. Having helped Bystroletov to acquire a British 
passport in the name of Robert Grenville, Oldham told 
him that the passport had been personally issued by the 
Foreign Secretary, Sir John Simon, who believed it to be 
for a minor British aristocrat of his acquaintance. Lord 
Robert Grenville, then resident in Canada. “I didn’t know 
Lord Robert was here in Britain,” Simon was alleged to 
have remarked to Oldham. Mrs. Oldham also specialized 
in tall stories. She told Bystroletov that she was the sister 
of an army officer named Montgomery who, she claimed, 
held the (non-existent) post of head of the intelligence 
service at the Foreign Office a later note on the KGB 
file, probably dating from the 1940s, identified the 
mysterious and possibly mythical Montgomery as Field 
Marshal Viscount Montgomery of Alamein! Expert 
though Bystroletov proved as an agent controller, his 
ignorance of the ways of the Foreign Office and the 
British establishment made him curiously gullible — 
though perhaps no more so than the Centre, which was 



also taken in.^^ 

De Ry, meanwhile, was providing Bystroletov at 
meetings in Berlin with a mixture of genuine diplomatic 
documents (Italian ciphers probably chief among them) 
and colorful inventions. According to Bystroletov, when 
asked whether some of his material was genuine, he 
replied indignantly, “What kind of question is that? Of 
course they are ... Your Japanese are idiots. Write and tell 
them to start printing American dollars. Instead of paying 
me 200,000 genuine francs, give me a million forged 
dollars and we’ll be quits.” The Centre was taken in by at 
least some of de Ry’s inventions. Possibly to disguise the 
fact that he was also trying to sell Italian ciphers to the 
French and other purchasers, he claimed that Mussolini’s 
son-in-law. Count Galeazzo Ciano di Cortellazzo (later 
Italian foreign minister), had organized “an extensive 
trade in ciphers” and, when a cipher was missing from the 
Berlin embassy, had ordered the liquidation of an 
innocent scapegoat to divert attention from himself. Since 
the OGPU believed that Western intelligence agencies, 
like itself, organized secret assassinations, it had 
surprisingly little difficulty in crediting de Ry’s 
improbable tale.^^ De Ry appears to have tried to deceive 
the OGPU on two other occasions by putting it in contact 
with bogus officials who claimed to have German and 
British diplomatic ciphers for sale. 

The Centre attached great importance, however, to an 



introduction provided by de Ry to his friend the Paris 
businessman Rodolphe Lemoine, an agent and recruiter of 
the French foreign intelligence service, the military 
Deuxieme Bureau. Bom Rudolf Stallmann, the son of a 
wealthy Berlin jeweler, Lemoine had begun working for 
the Deuxieme Bureau in 1918 and acquired French 
citizenship. Intelligence for Lemoine was a passion as 
well as a second career. According to one of his chiefs in 
the Deuxieme Bureau, “He was as hooked on espionage 
as a dmnk is on alcohol.” Lemoine’ s greatest coup was 
the recmitment in 1931 of a German cipher and SIGINT 
clerk, Hans-Thilo Schmidt, whose compulsive 
womanizing had mn him into debt. For the next decade 
Schmidt (codenamed HE and ASCHE by the French) was 
the Deuxieme Bureau’s most important foreign agent.^^ 
Some of the intelligence he provided laid the foundations 
for the breaking of the German Enigma machine cipher by 
British cryptanalysts in the Second World War.^^ 

After Bystroletov had made the initial contact with 
Lemoine (codenamed REX by the Deuxieme Bureau and 
JOSEPH by the OGPU), he was instmcted to hand the 
case over to another, less flamboyant Soviet illegal, 
Ignace Reiss (alias “Ignace Poretsky,” codenamed 
RAYMOND) so that he could concentrate on mnning 
Oldham. At meetings with Lemoine, Reiss posed initially 
as an American military intelligence officer. Lemoine 
appeared anxious to set up an exchange of intelligence on 



Germany and foreign cipher systems, and supplied a 
curious mixture of good and bad intelligence as evidence 
of the Deuxieme Bureau’s willingness to cooperate. An 
Italian cipher which he provided in May 1931 seems to 
have been genuine. In February 1932, however, Lemoine 
reported the sensationally inaccurate news that Hitler 
(who became German chancellor less than a year later) 
had made two secret visits to Paris and was in the pay of 
the Deuxieme Bureau. “We French,” he claimed, “are 
doing everything to hasten his rise to power.” The Centre 
dismissed the report as disinformation, but ordered 
meetings with Lemoine to continue and for him to be 
paid, probably with the intention of laying a trap which 
would end in his recruitment.^^ 

In November 1933 Lemoine brought with him to meet 
Reiss the head of the SIGINT section of the Deuxieme 
Bureau, Gustave Bertrand, codenamed OREL (“Eagle”) 
by the Centre. To try to convince Bertrand that he was an 
American intelligence officer willing to exchange cipher 
material, Reiss offered him Latin American diplomatic 
ciphers. Bertrand, predictably, was more interested in 
European ciphers.^^ Soon after his first meeting with 
Bertrand, Reiss informed Lemoine that he worked not for 
American intelligence but for the OGPU. The Centre 
probably calculated that it had caught Lemoine in a trap, 
forcing him either to admit to his superiors that he had 
been both paid and deceived by the OGPU or to conceal 
that information and risk being blackmailed into working 



for the Soviet Union. The blackmail failed. Lemoine 
had probably realized for some time that Reiss, whom he 
knew as “Walter Scott,” worked for Soviet intelligence. 
Reiss had several further meetings with Lemoine and 
Bertrand, at which they exchanged intelligence on Italian, 
Czechoslovak and Hungarian ciphers. 

WHILE REISS WAS maintaining contact with Lemoine, 
Bystroletov was finding Oldham increasingly desperate to 
extricate himself from the OGPU. By the summer of 1932 
Bystroletov feared that Oldham’s worsening alcoholism 
and carelessness at work would attract the attention of 
MI5. The Centre concluded that Oldham’s increasingly 
erratic behavior also risked exposing Bystroletov to a 
terrible revenge from the supposedly ruthless British 
intelligence services. On September 17, in recognition of 
his bravery in the face of nonexistent British assassination 
squads, it presented him with a rifle carrying the 
inscription “For unstinting struggle against Counter- 
Revolution, from your colleagues in the OGPU.”^^ 

On September 30, 1932, less than a fortnight after 
Bystroletov received his rifle, Oldham resigned from the 
Foreign Office, unable to stand the pressures of his double 
life.^^ To his despair, the OGPU still refused to leave him 
in peace. Over the next year Bystroletov extracted from 
him details of all his former colleagues in the 
Communications Department, hoping to recruit at least 



one of them as Oldham’s successor. As his drinking got 
further out of control, Oldham became convinced that his 
arrest was only a matter of time. His wife told Bystroletov 
that her husband believed that the permanent under- 
secretary at the Foreign Office, Sir Robert Vansittart, had 
personally put him under observation and that British 
intelligence was also on the trail of Bystroletov.^^ Though 
there was probably no substance to these fears, the Centre 
took them seriously. The OGPU trouble-shooter and 
“flying illegal” Teodor Maly reported to the Centre from 
London on July 6 that Bystroletov was in great danger: 

It is possible that ANDREI [Bystroletov] will be 
liquidated by the enemy. None the less I have not 
given an order for his immediate departure. For him 
to depart now would mean the loss of a source of 
such importance [Oldham] that it would weaken our 
defense and increase the power of the enemy. The 
loss of ANDREI is possible today, as is that of other 
colleagues tomorrow. The nature of their work 
makes such risks unavoidable.^^ 

The Centre replied on August 10: 

Please inform ANDREI that we here are fully aware 
of the self-denial, discipline, resourcefulness and 
courage that he has shown in the very difficult and 
dangerous conditions of recent days while working 



with ARNO. 


41 

Bystroletov continued to receive high praise for his skill 
in outwitting a British version of the Serebryansky 
Service which existed only in the conspiratorial 
imagination of the OGPU. 

On September 29, 1933, almost a year to the day after 
his resignation from the Foreign Office, Oldham was 
found unconscious in the gas-filled kitchen of his house in 
Pembroke Gardens, rushed to the hospital and pronounced 
dead on arrival. An inquest found that he had taken his 
life by “coal gas suffocation” while of “unsound mind.”^^ 
The Centre had no doubt that Oldham had been murdered. 
Its report on his death concluded: “In order to avoid a 
scandal the [British] intelligence service had ARNO 
physically eliminated, making his death appear to be 
suicide.” It believed, however, that Bystroletov had 
disguised his identity so successfully that the Foreign 
Office believed Oldham had been working for French 
rather than Soviet intelligence.^^ 

Oldham’s suicide did little if anything to alert the 
Foreign Office to the chronic problems of its own security 
and that of British embassies abroad.^^ Still concerned by 
fears that he was being pursued by a secret British 
assassination squad, however, Bystroletov failed to grasp 
how relatively unprotected a target the Foreign Office 
remained. He concluded that a safer recruiting ground was 



Geneva, where several of Oldham’s former colleagues 
were working as cipher clerks with the British delegation 
to the League of Nations. In December 1933 he made 
contact there with Raymond Oake (codenamed 
SHELLEY), one of the most promising potential recruits 
in the communications department identified by 
Oldham.^^ Oake had good reason to resent his 
underprivileged status. Since joining the Foreign Office in 
1920 he had remained in the lowly rank of “temporary 
clerk” without pension rights. Bystroletov handed over 
the cultivation of Oake to the Dutch artist Henri Christian 
(“Han”) Pieck, who operated as an OGPU illegal 
codenamed COOPER.^^ 

Pieck was almost as flamboyant an extrovert as 
Bystroletov, with a convivial manner which won him a 
wide circle of friends and acquaintances among British 
officials and journalists in Geneva. He invited Oake and 
other cipher clerks to stay at his house in The Hague 
where he lavished charm and hospitality on them while 
assessing them as possible recruits. Oake’s main service 
to Soviet intelligence was to provide an introduction to 
Captain John H. King, who joined the Foreign Office 
communications department as a “temporary clerk” in 
193448 subsequently became a far more important 
agent than Oake himself. Pieck reported that King had 
been bom in Ireland, considered himself Irish rather than 
British and, though anti-Soviet, also “hated the English.” 



Estranged from his wife and with an American mistress to 
support, he found it difficult to live on his modest Foreign 
Office salary. Pieck cultivated King with patience and 
skill. On one occasion he and his wife took King and his 
lover for an expensive touring holiday in Spain, staying at 
the best hotels. Mrs. Pieck complained that the whole 
holiday had been “a real ordeal” and that King and his 
mistress were “incredibly boring. The Piecks’ 
hospitality, however, paid off handsomely. Seven months 
after his first meeting with Pieck, King (henceforth 
codenamed MAG) began to hand over large amounts of 
classified material, including Foreign Office telegrams, 
ciphers and secret daily and weekly summaries of 
diplomatic correspondence.^^ 

AN ANAFYSIS BY the Centre concluded that about 30 
percent of King’s material was the same as that provided 
by Francesco Constantini (DUNCAN), the long-serving 
OGPU agent in the British embassy at Rome.^^ The 
overlap was, almost certainly, regarded as useful for 
checking the authenticity of the documents received from 
both agents. It was a sign of the importance attached to 
Constantini ’s intelligence that Abram Aronovich Slutsky, 
who succeeded Artuzov as head of INO in 1934, decided 
to transfer him from the legal residency in Rome to 
another of the Great Illegals, Moisei Markovich Akselrod 
(codenamed OST or OSTO), one of the leading Soviet 



agent controllers. Bom into a Jewish family in Smolensk 
in 1898, Akselrod had been a member of the Russian 
branch of the Zionist socialist organization Poale Zion, 
until its dissolution in 1922. He then joined the 
Bolsheviks and in 1925 began a career in INO.^^ Like 
most of the Great Illegals, Akselrod was a remarkable 
linguist — fluent in Arabic, English, French, German and 
Italian — and, according to a fellow illegal, a man of 
“extraordinary culture” with “a fine indifference to 
risk.”^^ In 1934 he traveled to Rome on an Austrian 
passport to establish a new illegal residency and act as 
Constantini’s controller. He had his first meeting with 
Constantini in January 1935.^^ 

Few — if any — Soviet controllers ever met an agent as 
frequently as Akselrod saw Constantini. At times they had 
almost daily meetings. On October 27, 1935 the Centre 
cabled Akselrod: “Between September 24 and October 14 
you met [Constantini] 16 times. There must be no more 
than two or three meetings a week.” It is not difficult to 
understand Akselrod’s enthusiasm for agent DUNCAN. 
Constantini supplied him with a remarkable range of 
documents and cipher material from embassy red boxes, 
diplomatic bags, filing cabinets and — ^probably — the 
embassy safe. Far from consisting simply of material on 
British-Italian relations, the documents included Foreign 
Office reports and British ambassadors’ despatches on a 
great variety of major international issues, which were 



sent for information to the Rome embassy. A Centre 
report noted on November 15, 1935 that no fewer than 
101 of the British documents obtained from Constantini 
since the beginning of the year had been judged 
sufficiently important to be “sent to Comrade Stalin”: 
among them the Foreign Office records of talks between 
Sir John Simon, the British Foreign Secretary, Anthony 
Eden, junior Foreign Office minister (who became 
Foreign Secretary at the end of the year), and Hitler in 
Berlin; between Eden and Litvinov, the Soviet Commissar 
for Foreign Affairs, in Moscow; between Eden and 
Joseph Beck, the Polish foreign minister, in Warsaw; 
between Eden and Edvard Benes, the Czechoslovak 
foreign minister, in Prague; and between Eden and 
Mussolini in Rome.^^ 

A striking omission from the Centre’s list of the most 
important Foreign Office documents supplied to Stalin 
was Eden’s account of his talks with him during his visit 
to Moscow in March 1935 — despite the fact that this 
document was sent to the Rome embassy and was 
probably among those obtained by Constantini.^^ Since 
this was Stalin’s first meeting with a minister from a 
Western government, their talks were of unusual 
significance. The most likely explanation for the Centre’s 
failure to send the British record of the meeting to the 
Kremlin is that Slutsky feared to pass on to Stalin some of 
Eden’s comments about him. INO would have been 
unembarrassed to report the fact that Eden was impressed 



by Stalin’s “remarkable knowledge and understanding of 
international affairs.” But it doubtless lacked the nerve to 
repeat Eden’s conclusion that Stalin was “a man of strong 
oriental traits of character with unshakeable assurance and 
control whose courtesy in no way hid from us an 
implacable ruthlessness.” The Centre was probably also 
nervous about reporting some of the opinions attributed 
by Eden to Stalin — for example, that he was “perhaps 
more appreciative of [the] German point of view than 
Monsieur Litvino[v].”^^ There was no more dangerous 
activity in Moscow than repeating criticisms of Stalin or 
attributing heretical opinions to him. 

The British ambassador in Moscow, Viscount Chilston, 
optimistically reported that, as a result of Eden’s visit, 
“the Soviet Government appears to have got rid of the 
bogey in their minds, that we were encouraging Germany 
against Soviet plans for Eastern security.”^^ Stalin, 
however, rarely — if ever — abandoned a conspiracy theory 
and remained deeply suspicious of British policy. In a 
communique at the end of his talks in Moscow, Eden had 
welcomed the Soviet Union’s support for the principle of 
collective security, following its entry the previous year 
into the League of Nations (hitherto denounced by 
Moscow as the “League of Burglars”). But Stalin must 
have learned from Foreign Office documents that Eden 
was disinclined to involve the Soviet Union in any 
collective security arrangements designed to contain Nazi 



Germany. To Stalin’s deeply suspicious mind, this 
reluctance was further evidence of a British plot to focus 
German aggression in the east.^^ Though he was content 
to entrust most day-to-day diplomacy to the efficient and 
far more pragmatic Litvinov, it was Stalin who 
determined the strategic thrust of Soviet foreign policy. 

The Centre had suspected for some time that its 
principal source of British diplomatic documents over the 
last decade, the mercenary agent Francesco Constantin! 
(DUNCAN), had been selling some material to Italian 
intelligence as well as to the NKVD. It had dramatic 
confirmation of these suspicions in February 1936, when 
a British assessment of the Italo-Ethiopian war — 
purloined by Constantin! from the British embassy — was 
published on the front page of the Giornale dltalia.^^ On 
being challenged by Akselrod, Constantin! was forced to 
admit that he had supplied some documents to the 
Italians, but concealed the large scale on which he had 
done so. Constantin! also admitted in 1936 that he had 
lost his job in the British embassy, though he apparently 
omitted that he had been sacked for dishonesty. He tried 
to reassure Akselrod by telling him that he had a former 
colleague in the embassy who would continue to supply 
him with classified documents. The colleague was later 
identified as Constantin! ’s brother Secondo (codenamed 
DUDLEY), who had worked as a servant in the embassy 
Chancery for the previous twenty years. 



Secondo Constantini, however, took fewer precautions 
than his brother Francesco. In January he stole a diamond 
necklace belonging to the ambassador’s wife from a 
locked red box (normally used for diplomatic documents 
rather than jewelery) which was kept in the ambassador’s 
apartment next to the Chancery. The ambassador, Sir Eric 
Drummond (soon to become Lord Perth), who had 
previously dismissed the idea that the British diplomatic 
documents appearing in the Italian press might have been 
purloined from his embassy, now began to grasp that 
embassy security might, after all, require serious 
attention. Since the Foreign Office had no security officer, 
it was forced to seek the help of Major Valentine Vivian, 
the head of SIS counter-intelligence. Vivian modestly 
disclaimed significant expertise in embassy security but, 
in view of the even greater lack of expertise in the Foreign 
Office, agreed to carry out an investigation.^^ Once in 
Rome, he quickly discovered an appalling series of basic 
lapses. The embassy files, safe and red boxes were all 
insecure and “it would not be impossible or even difficult 
for unauthorized persons to spend long periods in the 
Chancery or Registry rooms.” 

Vivian quickly identified Secondo Constantini as the 
man probably responsible for the theft both of the 
diamond necklace and of at least some of the documents 
supplied to Italian intelligence: 


S. Constantini ... has been employed in the Chancery 



for twenty-one years. He might, therefore, have been 
directly or indirectly responsible for any, or all, of 
the thefts of papers or valuables which have taken 
place, or are thought to have taken place, from this 
Mission. He was, I understand, not quite free of 
suspicion of being himself concerned in a dishonest 
transaction for which his brother [Francesco], then 
also a Chancery servant, was dismissed a short time 
ago. Moreover, though the Diplomatic Staff at the 
time did not connect him with the matter, I am clear 
in my own mind that the circumstances of the loss of 
two copies of the “R” Code from a locked press 
[filing cabinet] in the Chancery in 1925 point 
towards S. Constantini, or his brother, or both, as the 
culprits.^^ 

Though Sir Eric Drummond politely welcomed Vivian’s 
recommendations for improvements in the security of his 
embassy, he took little action. In particular, neither he 
nor most of his staff could credit the charges against 
Secondo Constantini, whom they regarded as “a sort of 
friend of the family. Instead of being dismissed, agent 
DUDLEY and his wife were — amazingly — invited to 
London in May 1937 as the guests of His Majesty’s 
Government at the coronation of King George VI, as a 
reward for his long and supposedly faithful service. 

When Secondo Constantini returned from his expense- 



paid junket in London, he was able to resume supplying 
classified British documents to his brother Francesco, 
who passed them on for copying by both Akselrod’s 
illegal residency and Italian intelligence before returning 
them to embassy files. The Centre regarded the whole 
improbable story of Constantin! ’s continued access to 
embassy files after Vivian’s investigation as deeply 
suspicious. Unable to comprehend the naivety of the 
British foreign service in matters of embassy security, it 
suspected instead some deep-laid plot by British and/or 
Italian intelligence. Regular meetings with Francesco 
Constantin! were suspended in August 1937.^^ 

THE CIPHER MATERIAL obtained from the Constantin! 
brothers. Captain King and other agents in Western 
embassies and foreign ministries was passed to the most 
secret section of Soviet intelligence, a joint OGPU/Fourth 
Department SIGINT unit housed not in the Lubyanka but 
in the Foreign Affairs building on Kuznetsky Bridge. 
According to Evdokia Kartseva (later Petrova), who 
joined the unit in 1933, its personnel were forbidden to 
reveal even the location of their office to their closest 
relatives. Like most young women in the unit, Kartseva 
was terrified of its head, Gleb Ivanovich Boky, who had 
made his reputation first in conducting the “Red Terror” 
in Petrograd in 1918, then in terrorizing Turkestan later in 
the civil war.^^ Though in his mid-fifties, Boky still 



prided himself on his sexual athleticism and arranged 
group sex weekends at his dacha. Kartseva lived in fear of 
being invited to the orgies. During the night shift, when 
she felt most vulnerable, she wore her “plainest and 
dullest clothes for fear of attracting [Boky’s] unwelcome 
attention.”^ ^ 

Despite the personal depravity of its chief, the 
combined OGPU/Fourth Department unit was the world’s 
largest and best-resourced SIGINT agency. In particular, 
thanks to Bystroletov and others, it received more 
assistance from espionage than any similar agency in the 
West. The records seen by Mitrokhin show that Boky’s 
unit was able to decrypt at least some of the diplomatic 
traffic of Britain, Austria, Germany and Italy.^^ Other 
evidence shows that Boky’s unit was also able to decrypt 
some Japanese, Turkish^^ and — almost certainly — 
American^^ and French^^ cables. No Western SIGINT 
agency during the 1930s seems to have collected so much 
political and diplomatic intelligence. 

The unavailability of most of the decrypts produced by 
Boky’s unit makes detailed analysis of their influence on 
Soviet foreign policy impossible. Soviet SIGINT 
successes, however, included important Japanese decrypts 
on the negotiation of the Anti-Comintem Pact between 
Germany and Japan. The published version of the Pact, 
concluded in November 1936, merely provided for an 
exchange of information on Comintern activities and 



cooperation on preventive measures against them. A 
secret protocol, however, added that if either of the 
signatories became the victim of “an unprovoked [Soviet] 
attack or threat of attack,” both would immediately 
consult together on the action to take and do “nothing to 
ease the situation of the USSR.” Moscow, unsurprisingly, 
read sinister intentions into this tortuous formula, though 
Japan was, in reality, still anxious not to be drawn into a 
European war and had no intention of concluding a 
military alliance. Three days after the signing of the Anti- 
Comintem Pact, Litvinov publicly announced in a speech 
to a Congress of Soviets that Moscow knew its secret 
protocol. His speech also contained a curious veiled 
allusion to codebreaking: 

It is not surprising that it is assumed by many that 
the German-Japanese agreement is written in a 
special code in which anti-Communism means 
something entirely different from the dictionary 
definition of this word, and that people decipher this 
code in different ways.^^ 

The success of Boky’s unit in decrypting Italian 
diplomatic traffic probably provided intelligence on 
Italy’s decision to join the Anti-Comintem Pact in the 
following year. 


THANKS TO ITS penetration agents and codebreakers. 



as well as to primitive Foreign Office security, Soviet 
intelligence was able to gather vastly more intelligence on 
the foreign policy of its main Western target, Great 
Britain, than the much smaller British intelligence 
community was able to obtain on Soviet policy. Since 
1927 British codebreakers had been unable to decrypt any 
high-level Soviet communications (though they had some 
success with the less sophisticated Comintern ciphers). 
SIS did not even possess a Moscow station. In 1936 the 
British ambassador. Viscount Chilston, vetoed a proposal 
to establish one on the grounds that it would be “liable to 
cause severe embarrassment.” But without an SIS 
presence he despaired of discovering anything of 
importance about Soviet policy-making.^^ 

The Soviet capacity to understand the political and 
diplomatic intelligence it collected, however, never 
approached its ability to collect that intelligence in the 
first place. Its natural tendency to substitute conspiracy 
theory for pragmatic analysis when assessing the 
intentions of the encircling imperialist powers was made 
worse during the 1930s by Stalin’s increasing tendency to 
act as his own intelligence analyst. Stalin, indeed, actively 
discouraged intelligence analysis by others, which he 
condemned as “dangerous guesswork.” “Don’t tell me 
what you think,” he is reported to have said. “Give me the 
facts and the source!” As a result, INO had no analytical 
department. Intelligence reports throughout and even 
beyond the Stalin era characteristically consisted of 



compilations of relevant information on particular topics 
with little argument or analysis Those who compiled 
them increasingly feared for their life expectancy if they 
failed to tell Stalin what he expected to hear. Their main 
priority as they trawled through the Centre’s treasure 
trove of British diplomatic documents and decrypts was to 
discover the anti-Soviet conspiracies which Comrade 
Stalin, “Lenin’s outstanding pupil, the best son of the 
Bolshevik Party, the worthy successor and great continuer 
of Lenin’s cause,” knew were there. The main function of 
Soviet foreign intelligence was thus to reinforce rather 
than to challenge Stalin’s misunderstanding of the West. 

A characteristic example of the Centre’s distorted but 
politically correct presentation of important intelligence 
was its treatment of the Foreign Office record of the 
meeting in March 1935 between Sir John Simon, Anthony 
Eden and Adolf Hitler in Berlin. Copies of the minutes 
were supplied both by Captain King in the Foreign Office 
and by Francesco Constantini in the Rome embassy.^^ 
Nine days before the meeting, in defiance of the post-First 
World War Treaty of Versailles, Hitler had announced the 
introduction of conscription. The fact that the meeting — 
the first between Hitler and a British foreign secretary — 
went ahead at all was, in itself, cause for suspicion in 
Moscow. On the British side the talks were mainly 
exploratory — to discover what the extent of Hitler’s 
demands for the revision of the Treaty of Versailles really 
was, and what prospect there was of accommodating 



them. Moscow, however, saw grounds for deep suspicion. 
While disclaiming any intention of attacking the Soviet 
Union, Hitler claimed that there was a distinct danger of 
Russia starting a war, and declared himself “firmly 
convinced that one day cooperation and solidarity would 
be urgently necessary to defend Europe against the ... 
Bolshevik menace.” Simon and Eden showed not the 
slightest interest in an anti-Bolshevik agreement, but their 
fairly conventional exchange of diplomatic pleasantries 
had sinister overtones in Moscow. According to the 
Foreign Office record, “The British Ministers were 
sincerely thankful for the way in which they had been 
received in Berlin, and would take away very pleasant 
memories of the kindness and hospitality shown them.”^^ 

The British record of the talks ran to over 23,000 
words. The Russian translation circulated by the Centre to 
Stalin and others in the Soviet leadership came to fewer 
than 4,000. Instead of producing a conventional precis the 
Centre selected a series of statements by Simon, Eden, 
Hitler and other participants in the talks, and assembled 
them into what appeared as a continuous conversation. 
The significance of some individual statements was thus 
distorted by removing them from their detailed context. 
Probably at the time, certainly subsequently, one of 
Simon’s comments was misconstrued as giving Germany 
carte blanche to take over Austria. 

Doubtless in line with Stalin’s own conspiracy theories, 
the Centre interpreted the visit by Simon and Eden to 



Berlin as the first in a series of meetings at which British 
statesmen not only sought to appease Hitler but gave him 
encouragement to attack Russia. In reality, though some 
British diplomats would have been content to see the two 
dictators come to blows of their own accord, no British 
foreign secretary and no British government would have 
contemplated orchestrating such a conflict. The 
conspiracy theories which were bom in Stalin’s Moscow 
in the 1930s, however, have — remarkably — survived the 
end of the Soviet era. An SVR official history published 
in 1997 insists that the many volumes of published 
Foreign Office documents as well as the even more 
voluminous unpublished files in the Public Record Office 
cannot be relied upon. The British government, it 
maintains, is still engaged in a conspiracy to conceal the 
existence of documents which reveal the terrible tmth 
about British foreign policy before the Second World 
War: 


Some documents from the 1930s having to do with 
the negotiations of British leaders with the highest 
leadership of Fascist Germany, including directly 
with Hitler, have been kept to this day in secret 
archives of the British Foreign Office. The British do 
not want the indiscreet peering at the proof of their 
policy of collusion with Hitler and spurring Germany 
on to its eastern campaign. 



FOUR 


THE MAGNIFICENT FIVE 


Among the select group of inter-war heroes of foreign 
intelligence whose portraits hang today on the walls of the 
SVR’s Memory Room at Yasenevo is the Austrian Jew 
Arnold Deutsch, probably the most talented of all the 
Great Illegals. According to an SVR official eulogy, the 
portrait immediately “attracts the visitor’s attention” to 
“its intelligent, penetrating eyes, and strong-willed 
countenance.” Deutsch’ s role as an illegal was not 
publicly acknowledged by the KGB until 1990.^ Even 
now, some aspects of his career are considered unsuitable 
for publication in Moscow. 

Deutsch’ s academic career was one of the most brilliant 
in the history of Soviet intelligence. In July 1928, two 
months after his twenty-fourth birthday and less than five 
years after entering Vienna University as an 
undergraduate, he was awarded the degree of PhD with 
distinction. Though his thesis had been on chemistry, 
Deutsch had also become deeply immersed in philosophy 
and psychology. His description of himself in university 
documents throughout his student years as an observant 



Jew (mosaischf- was probably intended to conceal his 
membership of the Communist Party. Deutsch’s religious 
faith had been replaced by an ardent commitment to the 
Communist International’s vision of a new world order 
which would free the human race from exploitation and 
alienation. The revolutionary myth image of the world’s 
first worker-peasant state blinded both Deutsch and the 
ideological agents he later recruited to the increasingly 
brutal reality of Stalin’s Russia. Immediately after leaving 
Vienna University, Deutsch began secret work as a 
courier for OMS, Comintern’s international liaison 
department, traveling to Romania, Greece, Palestine and 
Syria. His Austrian wife, Josefme, whom he married in 
1929, was also recruited by OMS.^ 

Deutsch’s vision of a new world order included sexual 
as well as political liberation. At about the time he began 
covert work for Comintern, he became publicly involved 
in the “sex-pol” (sexual politics) movement, founded by 
the German Communist psychologist and sexologist 
Wilhelm Reich, which opened clinics to bring birth 
control and sexual enlightenment to Viennese workers.^ 
At this stage of his career, Reich was engaged in an 
ambitious attempt to integrate Freudianism with Marxism 
and in the early stages of an eccentric research program 
on human sexual behavior which later earned him an 
undeserved reputation as “the prophet of the better 
orgasm.”^ Deutsch enthusiastically embraced Reich’s 



teaching that political and sexual repression were different 
sides of the same coin and together paved the way for 
fascism. He ran the Munster Verlag in Vienna which 
published Reich’s work and other “sex-pol” literature.^ 
Though the Viennese police were probably unaware of 
Deutsch’s secret work for OMS, its anti-pomography 
section took a keen interest in his involvement with the 
“sex-pol” movement.^ 

Remarkably, Deutsch combined, at least for a few 
years, his role as an open disciple of Reich with secret 
work as a Soviet agent. In 1932 he was transferred from 
OMS to the INO, and trained in Moscow as an OGPU 
illegal with the alias “Stefan Lange” and the codename 
STEFAN. (Later, he also used the codename OTTO.) His 
first posting was in France, where he established secret 
crossing points on the Belgian, Dutch and German 
borders, and made preparations to install radio equipment 
on French fishing boats to be used for OGPU 
communications in times of war.^ Deutsch owed his 
posthumous promotion to the ranks of KGB immortals to 
his second posting in England. 

The rules protecting the identities and legends of 
illegals in the mid- 1930s were far less rigid and elaborate 
than they were to become later. Early in 1934 Deutsch 
traveled to London under his real name, giving his 
profession as “university lecturer” and using his academic 
credentials to mix in university circles. After living in 



temporary accommodation, he moved to a flat in Lawn 
Road, Hampstead, the heartland of London’s radical 
intelligentsia. The “Lawn Road Flats,” as they were then 
known, were the first “deck-access” apartments with 
external walkways to be built in England (a type of 
construction later imitated in countless blocks of council 
flats) and, at the time, were probably Hampstead’s most 
avant-garde building. Deutsch moved into number 7, next 
to a flat owned by the celebrated crime novelist Agatha 
Christie, then writing Murder on the Orient Express. 
Though it is tempting to imagine Deutsch and Christie 
discussing the plot of her latest novel, they may never 
have met. Christie lived elsewhere and probably visited 
Lawn Road rarely, if at all, in the mid- 1930s. Deutsch, in 
any case, is likely to have kept a low profile. While the 
front doors of most flats were visible from the street, 
Deutsch’ s was concealed by a stairwell which made it 
possible for him and his visitors to enter and leave 
unobserved.^ Deutsch strengthened his academic cover by 
taking a postgraduate course in psychology at London 
University and possibly by part-time teaching. In 1935 
he was joined by his wife, who had been trained in 
Moscow as a radio operator. ^ ^ 

KGB files credit Deutsch during his British posting 
with the recruitment of twenty agents and contact with a 
total of twenty-nine.^^ By far the most celebrated of these 
agents were a group of five young Cambridge graduates. 



who by the Second World War were known in the Centre 
as “The Five”: Anthony Blunt, Guy Burgess, John 
Caimcross, Donald Maclean and Kim Philby. After the 
release of the enormously popular Western The 
Magnificent Seven in 1960, they were often referred to as 
the “Magnificent Five.” The key to Deutsch’s success was 
his new strategy of recruitment, approved by the Centre, 
based on the cultivation of young radical high-fliers from 
leading universities before they entered the corridors of 
power. As Deutsch wrote to the Centre: 

Given that the Communist movement in these 
universities is on a mass scale and that there is a 
constant turnover of students, it follows that 
individual Communists whom we pluck out of the 
Party remain will pass unnoticed, both by the Party 
itself and by the outside world. People forget about 
them. And if at some time they do remember that 
they were once Communists, this will be put down to 
a passing fancy of youth, especially as those 
concerned are scions of the bourgeoisie. It is up to us 
to give the individual [recruit] a new [non- 
Communist] political personality.^^ 

Since the universities of Oxford and Cambridge provided 
a disproportionate number of Whitehall’s highest fliers, it 
was plainly logical to target Oxbridge rather than the red 
brick universities elsewhere. The fact that the new 



recruitment was based chiefly on Cambridge rather than 
Oxford was due largely to chance: the fact that the first 
potential recruit to come to Deutsch’s attention, Kim 
Philby, was a graduate of Trinity College, Cambridge. Of 
the other members of the “Magnificent Five,” all recruited 
as a direct or indirect consequence of Philby ’s own 
recruitment, three (Blunt, Burgess and Caimcross) also 
came from Trinity College and the fourth (Maclean) from 
the neighboring Trinity Hall.^^ 

Deutsch’s recruitment strategy was to prove a 
spectacular success. By the early years of the Second 
World War all of the Five were to succeed in penetrating 
either the Foreign Office or the intelligence community. 
The volume of high-grade intelligence which they 
supplied was to become so large that Moscow sometimes 
had difficulty coping with it. 

AFTER GRADUATING FROM Cambridge in June 1933 
with the conviction that “my life must be devoted to 
Communism,” Philby spent most of the next year in 
Vienna working for the MOPR (the Russian acronym of 
the International Workers Relief Organization) and acting 
as a courier for the underground Austrian Communist 
Party. While in Vienna he met and married a young 
Communist divorcee, Litzi Friedman, after a brief but 
passionate love affair which included his first experience 
of making love in the snow (“actually quite warm, once 



you got used to it,” he later recalled). The first to 
identify Philby’s potential as a Soviet agent — and 
probably to draw him to the attention of Arnold Deutsch 
— was Litzi’s friend Edith Suschitsky, who was herself 
recruited by Deutsch and given the unimaginative 
codename EDITH. 

In May 1934 Kim and Litzi Philby returned to London, 
arriving some weeks after Deutsch. Several months earlier 
Edith Suschitsky had also taken up residence in London, 
marrying another recruit of Deutsch’ s, an English doctor 
named Alex Tudor Hart. The newly married couple were 
given the joint codename STRELA (“Arrow”). In June 
1934 Edith Tudor Hart took Philby to his first meeting 
with Deutsch on a bench in Regent’s Park, London. 
According to a later memoir written by Philby for the 
KGB, Deutsch instructed him, “We need people who 
could penetrate into the bourgeois institutions. Penetrate 
them for us!”^^ At this early stage, however, Deutsch did 
not tell Philby that he was embarking on a career as a 
Soviet agent. Instead, he gave him the initial impression 
that he was joining Comintern’s underground war against 
international fascism. Philby’s immediate task, Deutsch 
told him, was to break all visible contact with the 
Communist Party and to try to win the confidence of 
British pro-German and pro-fascist circles. As was not 
uncommon at this period, Philby’s first codename, given 
him immediately after his meeting with Deutsch, had two 



versions: SOHNCHEN in German or SYNOK in Russian 
— ^both roughly equivalent to “Sonny” in English.^ ^ 

Half a century later, Philby still remembered his first 
meeting with the man he knew as “Otto” as “amazing”: 

He was a marvelous man. Simply marvelous. I felt 
that immediately. And [the feeling] never left me ... 
The first thing you noticed about him were his eyes. 
He looked at you as if nothing more important in life 
than you and talking to you existed at that moment ... 
And he had a marvelous sense of humor.^^ 

It is difficult to imagine any other controller in the entire 
history of the KGB as ideally suited as Deutsch to the 
Cambridge Five. Though four of the Five graduated from 
Cambridge with first-class honors, Deutsch’ s academic 
career was even more brilliant than theirs, his 
understanding of human character more profound and his 
experience of life much broader. He combined a 
charismatic personality and deep psychological insight 
with visionary faith in the future of a human race freed 
from the exploitation and alienation of the capitalist 
system. His message of liberation had all the greater 
appeal to the Cambridge Five because it had a sexual as 
well as a political dimension. All the Five were rebels 
against the strict sexual mores as well as the antiquated 
class system of inter-war Britain. Burgess and Blunt were 
homosexuals, Maclean a bisexual and Philby a 



heterosexual athlete. Caimcross, a committed 
heterosexual, later wrote a history of polygamy which 
concluded with a quotation from George Bernard Shaw: 
“Women will always prefer a 10 percent share of a first- 
rate man to sole ownership of a mediocre man.”^^ 
Caimcross plainly considered himself first-rate rather than 
mediocre. Graham Greene was charmed by Caimcross ’s 
book. “Here at last,” he wrote to Caimcross, “is a book 
which will appeal strongly to all polygamists.”^^ 

During almost four years as an illegal controlling 
British agents, Deutsch served under three illegal 
residents, each of whom operated under a variety of 
aliases: Ignati Reif, codenamed MARR; Aleksandr Orlov, 
codenamed SCHWED (“Swede”); and Teodor Maly, 
successively codenamed PAUL, THEO and MANN. By 
1938 all three were to become victims of the Terror. Reif 
and Maly were shot for imaginary crimes. Orlov defected 
just in time to North America, securing his survival by 
threatening to arrange for the revelation of all he knew 
about Soviet espionage should he be pursued by an 
NKVD assassination squad.^^ Somewhat misleadingly, a 
KGB/S VR- sponsored biography of Orlov published in 
1993 claimed that he was “the mastermind” responsible 
for the recmitment of the Cambridge agents. There are 
probably two reasons for this exaggeration. The first is 
hierarchical. Within the Soviet nomenklatura senior 
bureaucrats commonly claimed, and were accorded, the 



credit for their subordinates’ successes. The claim that 
Orlov, the most senior intelligence officer involved in 
British operations in the 1930s, “recruited” Philby is a 
characteristic example of this common phenomenon.^^ 
But there are also more contemporary reasons for the 
inflation of Orlov’s historical importance. It suits the 
SVR, which sees itself as the inheritor of the finest 
traditions of the KGB First Chief Directorate, to seek to 
demonstrate the foolishness of Western intelligence and 
security services by claiming that they failed for over 
thirty years to notice that the leading recruiter of the 
Cambridge Five and other agents was living under their 
noses in the United States. For several years before his 
death in 1973, the KGB tried to persuade Orlov to return 
to a comfortable flat and generous pension in Russia, 
where he would doubtless have been portrayed for 
propaganda purposes as a man who, despite being forced 
to flee from Stalin’s Terror, had — like Philby — “kept faith 
with Lenin’s Revolution” and used his superior 
intelligence training to take in Western intelligence 
agencies for many years. 

In reality, Orlov spent only just over a year in London 
— ten days in July 1934, followed by the period from 
September 1934 to October 1935.^^ During that period 
Deutsch, who was subordinate in rank to Orlov, had to 
seek his approval for his intelligence operations. On 
occasion Orlov took the initiative in giving instructions to 



Deutsch. But the files noted by Mitrokhin make clear that 
the grand strategy which led to the targeting of Philby and 
other young Cambridge high-fliers was devised not by 
Orlov but by Deutsch.^ ^ And, as Philby himself 
acknowledged, no other controller equaled Deutsch’ s 
tactical skill in implementing that strategy. 

Philby’ s first major service to Soviet intelligence was 
to direct Deutsch to two other potential Cambridge 
recruits, Donald Maclean and Guy Burgess. If not 
already a committed Communist by the time he entered 
Trinity Hall, Cambridge, in 1931, Donald Maclean 
became one during his first year. As the handsome, 
academically gifted son of a former Liberal cabinet 
minister, Maclean must have seemed to Deutsch an 
almost ideal candidate to penetrate the corridors of power. 
On his graduation with first-class honors in modem 
languages in June 1934, however, Maclean showed no 
immediate sign of wanting a career in Whitehall. His 
ambition was either to teach English in the Soviet Union 
or to stay at Cambridge to work for a PhD. In the course 
of the summer he changed his mind, telling his mother 
that he intended to prepare for the Foreign Office entrance 
examinations in the following year.^^ That change of 
heart reflected the influence of Deutsch. The first 
approach to Maclean was made through Philby in August 
1934. Deutsch reported that Philby had been instmcted to 
meet Maclean, discuss his job prospects and contacts and 



ask him to open contact with the Communist Party and 
begin work for the NKVD. Maclean agreed. For the time 
being, however, the Centre refused to sanction meetings 
between Deutsch and Maclean, and contact with him for 
the next two months was maintained through Philby. 
Maclean’s first codename, like Philby’ s, had two 
versions: WAISE in German, SIROTA in Russian — ^both 
meaning “Orphan” (an allusion to the death of his father 
two years earlier). 

For some months Guy Burgess, then in his second year 
as a history research student at Trinity College preparing a 
thesis he was never to complete, had been enthused by the 
idea of conducting an underground war against fascism on 
behalf of the Communist International. Ironically, in view 
of the fact that he was soon to become one of the 
Magnificent Five, he seems to have been inspired by the 
example of the Filnfergruppen, the secret “groups of five” 
being formed by German Communists to organize 
opposition to Hitler. Maclean was, very probably, among 
the Communist friends with whom he discussed the (in 
reality rather unsuccessful) German groups of five.^^ 
When Maclean admitted, against his instructions, that he 
had been asked to engage in secret work,^^ Burgess was 
desperate for an invitation to join him. 

In December 1934 Maclean arranged a first meeting 
between Deutsch and Burgess. Deutsch already knew 
that Burgess was one of the most flamboyant figures in 



Cambridge: a brilliant, gregarious conversationalist 
equally at home with the teetotal intellectual discussions 
of the Apostles, the socially exclusive and heavy-drinking 
Pitt Club and the irreverent satirical revues of the 
Footlights. He made no secret either of his Communist 
sympathies or of his enjoyment of the then illegal 
pleasures of homosexual “rough trade” with young 
working-class men. A more doctrinaire and less 
imaginative controller than Deutsch might well have 
concluded that the outrageous Burgess would be a 
liability rather than an asset. But Deutsch may well have 
sensed that Burgess’s very outrageousness would give 
him good, if unconventional, cover for his work as a 
secret agent. No existing stereotype of a Soviet spy 
remotely resembled Burges s.^^ When invited to join the 
Comintern’s underground struggle against fascism, 
Burgess told Deutsch that he was “honored and ready to 
sacrifice everything for the cause.” His codename 
MADCHEN^^ (“Little Girl,” by contrast with Philby’s 
codename “Sonny”) was an obvious reference to his 
homosexuality. 

Deutsch initially told both Maclean and Burgess, like 
Philby, that their first task was to distance themselves 
from the left and conform to the ideas of the 
establishment in order to penetrate it successfully.^^ 
Maclean successfully persuaded his mother. Lady 
Maclean, that he had “rather gone off’ his undergraduate 



flirtation with Communism. In August 1935 he passed the 
Foreign Office exams with flying colors. When asked 
about his “Communist views” at Cambridge, Maclean 
decided to “brazen it out”: 

“Yes,” I said, “I did have such views — and I haven’t 
entirely shaken them off.” I think they must have 
liked my honesty because they nodded, looked at 
each other and smiled. Then the chairman said: 
“Thank you, that will be all, Mr. Maclean. 

In October 1935, as a new member of His Majesty’s 
Diplomatic Service, Maclean became the first of the 
Magnificent Five to penetrate the corridors of power. 

Burgess went about burying his Communist past with 
characteristic flamboyance. Late in 1935 he became 
personal assistant to the young rightwing gay 
Conservative MP Captain “Jack” Macnamara. Together 
they went on fact-finding missions to Nazi Germany 
which, according to Burgess, consisted largely of 
homosexual escapades with like-minded members of the 
Hitler Youth. Burgess built up a remarkable range of 
contacts among the continental “Homintem.” Chief 
among them was Edouard Pfeiffer, chef de cabinet to 
Edouard Daladier, French war minister from January 
1936 to May 1940 and prime minister from April 1938 to 
March 1940. Burgess boasted to friends that, “He and 
Pfeiffer and two members of the French cabinet ... had 



spent an evening together at a male brothel in Paris. 
Singing and dancing, they had danced around a table, 
lashing a naked boy, who was strapped to it, with leather 
whips. 

In February 1935 there was a security alert at the 
London illegal residency. Reif, operating under the alias 
“Max Wolisch,” was summoned for an interview at the 
Home Office and observed a large file in the name of 
Wolisch on his interviewer’s desk. Orlov reported to the 
Centre that the British authorities appeared to have been 
“digging around but could not come up with anything and 
decided to get rid of him.” Reif obeyed Home Office 
instructions to arrange for his prompt departure. Orlov 
feared that MI5 might also be on the trail of Deutsch and 
announced that as a precaution he was taking personal 
control of Philby, Maclean and Burgess, by now 
sometimes referred to as the “Three Musketeers.” Orlov 
believed that his own cover as an American businessman 
selling imported refrigerators from an office in Regent 
Street was still secure. In October, however, there was 
another security alert when he accidentally encountered a 
man who, some years earlier, had given him English 
lessons in Vienna and knew his real identity. Orlov made 
a hasty exit from London, never to return, leaving 
Deutsch to resume the running of the Cambridge 
recruits. 

Under Deutsch ’s control, Philby, Maclean and Burgess 
rapidly graduated as fully fledged Soviet agents. They 



may not have been told explicitly that they were working 
for the NKVD rather than assisting Comintern in its 
underground struggle against fascism, but they no longer 
needed formal notification. As Deutsch wrote later in a 
report for the Centre, “They all know that they are 
working for the Soviet Union. This was absolutely 
understood by them. My relations with them were based 
upon our Party membership.” In other words, Deutsch 
treated them not as subordinate agents but as comrades 
working under his guidance in a common cause and for 
the same ideals. Later, less flexible controllers than 
Deutsch were unhappy that Philby, Burgess and Maclean 
appeared to consider themselves as officers, rather than 
agents, of Soviet intelligence.^^ It came as a considerable 
shock to Philby after his defection to Moscow in 1963 to 
discover that, like other foreign agents, he did not possess, 
and would never be allowed to acquire, officer rank — 
hence his various attempts to mislead Western journalists 
into believing that he was Colonel, or even General, 
Philby of the KGB.^^ In his memoirs, published in 1968, 
Philby repeated the lie that he had “been a Soviet 
intelligence officer for some thirty-odd years. 

AFTER THE SECURITY scares of 1935, Deutsch and 
the illegal residency took increased precautions to evade 
MI5 and Special Branch surveillance. Before preparing 
for a meeting with an agent, usually in London, Deutsch 



would be driven out of town, watching carefully to see if 
the car was being followed. Once satisfied that he was not 
being tailed, he returned to London by public transport, 
changing several times en route. During his travels 
Deutsch concealed film of secret documents inside 
hairbrushes, travel requisites and household utensils. 
Reports to the Centre were usually sent in secret ink to an 
address in Copenhagen for forwarding to Moscow.^^ 
Though the KGB and SVR released interesting material 
in the early 1990s on the “Three Musketeers,” they 
avoided any reference to Norman John (“James”) 
Klugmann, recruited by Deutsch in 1936.^^ Klugmann 
and the young Marxist poet John Comford, “James and 
John,” were the two most prominent Communist Party 
activists in Cambridge. Though Comford was killed in the 
Spanish Civil War in 1937, just after his twenty-first 
birthday, Klugmann went on to become head of the 
Party’s Propaganda and Education Department, a member 
of the political committee (in effect its Politburo) and the 
Party’s official historian. He had become a Communist at 
Gresham’s School, Holt, where he had been a friend and 
contemporary of Donald Maclean. Klugmann won an 
open scholarship in modem languages to Trinity College, 
Maclean a slightly less prestigious exhibition to the 
neighboring Trinity Hall. Both graduated with first-class 
honors. Like Maclean, Anthony Blunt’s conversion to 
Communism owed something to Klugmann’ s influence. 
Blunt found him “an extremely good political theorisf’ 



who “ran the administration of the Party with great skill 
and energy ... It was primarily he who decided what 
organizations and societies in Cambridge were worth 
penetrating [by the Communists].”^^ Klugmann had an 
unshakable conviction that British capitalism was close to 
collapse. “We simply knew, all of us, that the revolution 
was at hand,” he later recalled. “If anyone had suggested 
it wouldn’t happen in Britain for say thirty years. I’d have 
laughed myself sick.”^^ 

Since Klugmann was one of Britain’s most active 
young Communists, there was little prospect that, like the 
Five, he could convincingly distance himself from the 
Party and penetrate the “bourgeois apparatus.” Deutsch 
saw another role for Klugmann: as a talent- spotter for the 
NKVD, capable, when necessary, of persuading 
Communist students to engage in underground work 
rather than conventional Party militancy. Before Deutsch 
recruited Klugmann, the NKVD obtained the approval of 
the British Party leadership. There was never any 
likelihood that the British general secretary, Harry Pollitt, 
would object. Like most Western Communist leaders he 
believed that the interests of the Communist International 
required unconditional support for the Soviet Union, 
whatever the twists of policy in the Kremlin. With 
Pollitt’ s consent, Klugmann was recruited by Deutsch as 
agent MER.^^ The refusal by the SVR until 1998 to admit 
Klugmann’ s recruitment was due to the involvement of 



the British Communist Party. One of the KGB’s most 
closely guarded secrets was the extent to which, as late as 
the 1980s, it expected the leaders of “fraternal parties” in 
the West to assist in the recruitment of agents and the 
fabrication of “legends” for its illegals. 

IN THE SPRING of 1936 the Centre appointed another of 
the Great Illegals, Teodor Maly (codenamed MANN), 
head of the illegal London residency. Like Deutsch, 
Maly was later included among the intelligence immortals 
whose portraits hung on the walls of the First Chief 
Directorate Memory Room. Hungarian by birth, Maly had 
entered a Catholic monastic order before the First World 
War but had volunteered for military service in 1914.^^ 
He was taken prisoner while serving as second lieutenant 
in the Austro-Hungarian army on the Russian front in 
1916, and spent the rest of the war in a series of POW 
camps. Maly later told one of his agents: 

I saw all the horrors, young men with frozen limbs 
dying in the trenches ... I lost my faith in God and 
when the Revolution broke out I joined the 
Bolsheviks. I broke with my past completely ... I 
became a Communist and have always remained 
one.^^ 


Maly was originally posted to London in January 1936 
to run the Foreign Office with cipher clerk Captain King 



(previously controlled by Pieck), to whom he introduced 
himself as an executive of the fictitious Dutch bank which 
King believed was paying him for classified documents. 
In April Maly was appointed illegal resident and 
henceforth shared with Deutsch in the running of the 
Cambridge agents. Like Deutsch, he impressed them with 
both his human sympathy and his visionary faith in the 
Communist millennium. 

During the early months of 1937 Deutsch and Maly 
completed the recruitment of the Magnificent Five. At the 
beginning of the year, Burgess, by then a producer at the 
BBC, arranged a first meeting between Deutsch and 
Anthony Blunt, French linguist, art historian and Fellow 
of Trinity College, Cambridge. Though the title of 
“Fourth Man” later accorded Blunt was a media invention 
rather than a KGB sobriquet, he was both the fourth of the 
Five to be recruited and, over forty years later, the fourth 
to be publicly exposed. Until the war Blunt’s chief role 
for the NKVD was that of talent- spotter. His first recruit, 
by agreement with Deutsch, was a wealthy young 
American Communist undergraduate at Trinity, Michael 
Straight (codenamed NIGEL). Shortly after his own first 
meeting with Deutsch, Blunt invited Straight to his 
elegant rooms in Trinity. Straight was still shattered by 
the news a fortnight earlier that his close friend, John 
Comford, had died a hero’s death in the Spanish Civil 
War. “Our friends,” Blunt told him, had been giving much 



thought to his future. “They have instructed me to tell you 
... what you must do.” “What friends?” Straight asked. 
“Our friends in the International, the Communist 
International,” Blunt replied. The “friends” had decided 
that Straight’s duty was to break all overt connection with 
the Party, get a job in Wall Street after his graduation later 
that year and provide Comintern with inside information. 
Straight protested. Comford had given his life for the 
International. “Remember that,” Blunt told him. A few 
days later. Straight agreed. “In the course of a week,” 
Straight wrote later, “I had moved out of the noisy, 
crowded world of Cambridge into a world of shadows and 
echoes.” His only meeting with Deutsch, whom he 
mistook for a Russian, took place in London just after his 
graduation. Deutsch asked him for some personal 
documents. Straight gave him a drawing. Deutsch tore it 
in two, gave him one halfback and told him the other half 
would be returned to him by a man who would contact 
him in New York. 

The last of the Magnificent Five to be recruited, and 
later the last to be publicly exposed, was the “Fifth Man,” 
John Caimcross, a brilliant Scot who in 1934 had entered 
Trinity at the age of twenty-one with a scholarship in 
modem languages, having already studied for two years at 
Glasgow University and gained a licence es lettres at the 
Sorbonne.^^ His passionate Marxism led the Trinity 
Magazine to give him the nickname “The Fiery Cross,” 
while his remarkable facility as a linguist led the same 



magazine to complain, “Caimcross ... learns a new 
language every fortnight.” Among his college teachers 
in French literature was Anthony Blunt, though 
Caimcross later claimed that they never discussed 
Communism.^^ In 1936, after graduating with first-class 
honors, Caimcross passed top of the Foreign Office 
entrance examinations, one hundred marks ahead of the 
next candidate (though he did less well at the 
interview). 

After Blunt had acted as talent- spotter, the initial 
approach to Caimcross early in 1937 was entmsted by 
Deutsch to Burgess^^ — much as Philby had made the first 
recmitment overture to Maclean in 1934. The actual 
recmitment of Caimcross shortly afterwards was 
entmsted to James Klugmann.^^ On April 9 Maly 
informed the Centre that Caimcross had been formally 
recmited and given the codename MOLIERE.^^ Had 
Caimcross known his codename, he might well have 
objected to its transparency but would undoubtedly have 
found appropriate the choice of his favorite French writer, 
on whom he later published two scholarly studies in 
French. For reasons not recorded in KGB files, the 
codename MOLIERE was later replaced by that of 
LISZT. In May Klugmann arranged Caimcross ’s first 
rendezvous with Deutsch. According to Caimcross ’s 
admittedly unreliable memoirs, the meeting took place 
one evening in Regent’s Park: 



Suddenly there emerged from behind the trees a 
short, stocky figure aged around forty, whom 
Klugmann introduced to me as Otto. Thereupon, 
Klugmann promptly disappeared 

Deutsch reported to Moscow that Caimcross “was very 
happy that we had established contact with him and was 
ready to start working for us at once.”^^ 

Among the pre- Second World War Foreign Office 
documents available to both Maclean and Caimcross, and 
thus to the NKVD, were what Caimcross described as “a 
wealth of valuable information on the progress of the 
Civil War in Spain. Only in a few cases, however, is it 
possible to identify individual documents supplied by 
Maclean and Caimcross which the Centre forwarded to 
Stalin, probably in the form of edited extracts. One such 
document, which seems to have made a particular 
impression on Stalin, is the record of talks with Hitler in 
November 1937 by Lord Halifax, Lord President of the 
Council (who, three months later, was to succeed Eden as 
Foreign Secretary). Halifax’s visit to Hitler’s mountain 
lair, the “Eagle’s Nesf’ at Berchtesgaden, got off to a 
farcical start. As the aristocratic Halifax stepped from his 
car, he mistook Hitler for a footman and was about to 
hand him his hat and coat when a German minister hissed 
in his ear, “Der Fuhrer! Der Fuhrer! The Centre, 
however, saw the whole meeting as deeply sinister. The 



extracts from Halifax’s record of his talks with Hitler, 
tailored to fit Stalin’s profound distrust of British policy, 
emphasized that Britain viewed Nazi Germany as “the 
bastion of the West against Bolshevism” and would take a 
sympathetic view of German expansion to the east7^ 
Though Halifax’s assessment of Hitler, whom he regarded 
as “very sincere,” was lamentably naive, his record of his 
comments on Germany’s role in defending the West 
against Communism were much more qualified than the 
Centre’s version of them. He told Hitler: 

Although there was much in the Nazi system that 
offended British opinion (treatment of the Church; to 
a perhaps lesser extent, the treatment of Jews; 
treatment of Trade Unions), I was not blind to what 
he had done for Germany and to the achievement 
from his point of view of keeping Communism out 
of his country and, as he would feel, of blocking its 
passage West. 

Halifax also said nothing to support German 
aggression in eastern Europe. His aim — unrealistic 
though it was — ^was to turn Hitler into “a good 
European” by offering him colonial concessions in 
order to persuade him to limit his European 
ambitions to those he could achieve peacefully. 
Halifax made clear, however, that Britain was 
prepared to contemplate the peaceful revision of 
Versailles: 



I said that there were no doubt ... questions arising 
out of the Versailles settlement which seemed to us 
capable of causing trouble if they were unwisely 
handled, e.g. Danzig, Austria, Czechoslovakia. On 
all these matters we were not necessarily concerned 
to stand for the status quo as today, but we were 
concerned to avoid such trouble of them as would be 
likely to cause trouble. If reasonable settlements 
could be reached with the free assent and goodwill of 
those primarily concerned we certainly had no desire 
to block them. 

Such statements were music to Hitler’s ears — not because 
he was interested in the peaceful revision of Versailles, 
but because he interpreted Halifax’s rather feeble attempt 
at conciliation as evidence that Britain lacked the nerve to 
fight when the time came for him to begin a war of 
conquest. Stalin, characteristically, saw a much more 
sinister purpose behind Halifax’s remarks and persuaded 
himself that Britain had deliberately given the green light 
to Nazi aggression in the east. The Foreign Office 
documents supplied by Maclean and Caimcross which 
recorded British attempts to appease Hitler were used by 
the Centre to provide the evidence which Stalin demanded 
of a deep-laid British plot to turn Hitler on the Soviet 
Union. 


THOUGH KIM PHILBY ultimately became the most 



important of the Magnificent Five, his career took off 
more slowly than those of the other four. He abandoned 
an attempt to join the civil service after both his referees 
(his Trinity director of studies and a family friend) warned 
him that, while they admired his energy and intelligence, 
they would feel bound to add that his “sense of political 
injustice might well unfit him for administrative work.” 
His only minor successes before 1937 were to gain a job 
on an uninfluential liberal monthly, the Review oj 
Reviews, and become a member of the Anglo-German 
Fellowship, contemptuously described by Churchill as the 
“Heil Hitler Brigade.” As Philby later acknowledged, he 
would often turn up for meetings with Deutsch “with 
nothing to offer” and in need of reassurance. The outbreak 
of the Spanish Civil War gave him his first important 
intelligence mission. He eventually persuaded a London 
news agency to give him a letter of accreditation as a 
freelance war correspondent and arrived in Spain in 
February 1937. “My immediate assignment,” he wrote 
later in his memoirs, “was to get first-hand information on 
all aspects of the fascist war effort.” As usual, his 
memoirs fail to tell the whole truth.^^ 

A few weeks after Philby ’s departure, the London 
illegal residency received instructions, undoubtedly 
approved by Stalin himself, to order Philby to assassinate 
General Francisco Franco, leader of the nationalist 
forces. Maly duly passed on the order but made clear to 
the Centre that he did not believe Philby capable of 



fulfilling Philby arrived back in London in May 
without even having set eyes on Franco and, Maly told 
the Centre, “in a very depressed state.” Philby’ s fortunes 
improved, however, after he was taken on by The Times 
as one of its two correspondents in nationalist Spain. At 
the end of the year he became a minor war hero. Three 
journalists sitting in a car in which he had been traveling 
were fatally injured by an artillery shell. Philby himself 
was slightly wounded. He reported modestly to Times 
readers, “Your correspondent ... was taken to a first aid 
station where light head injuries were speedily treated.” 
“My wounding in Spain,” wrote Philby later, “helped my 
work — ^both journalism and intelligence — no end.” For 
the first time he gained access to Franco, who on March 
2, 1938 pinned on his breast the Red Cross of Military 
Merit. Then, as Philby reported, “all sorts of doors opened 
for me.”^^ 

The doors, however, opened too late. By the time 
Philby gained access to Franco, the NKVD assassination 
plot had been abandoned. Since the spring of 1937 the 
Centre had been increasingly diverted from the war 
against Franco by what became known as the civil war 
within the Civil War. The destruction of Trotskyists 
became a higher priority than the liquidation of Franco. 
By the end of 1937 the hunt for “enemies of the people” 
abroad took precedence over intelligence collection. The 
remarkable talents of the Magnificent Five had yet to be 



fully exploited. INO was in turmoil, caught up in the 
paranoia of the Great Terror, with most of its officers 
abroad suspected of plotting with the enemy. The age of 
the Great Illegals was rapidly drawing to a brutal close. 



FIVE 


TERROR 


Though “special tasks” only began to dominate NKVD 
foreign operations in 1937, the problem of “enemies of 
the people” abroad had loomed steadily larger in Stalin’s 
mind since the early 1930s as he became increasingly 
obsessed with the opposition to him inside the Soviet 
Union. The most daring denunciation of the growing 
brutality of Stalin’s Russia was a letter of protest sent to 
the Central Committee in the autumn of 1932 by a former 
Party secretary in Moscow, Mikhail Ryutin, and a small 
band of supporters. The “Ryutin platform,” whose text 
was made public only in 1989, contained such an 
uncompromising attack on Stalin and the horrors which 
had accompanied collectivization and the First Five Year 
Plan over the previous few years that some Trotskyists 
who saw the document believed it was an OGPU 
provocation.^ It denounced Stalin as “the evil genius of 
the Russian Revolution, motivated by vindictiveness and 
lust for power, who has brought the Revolution to the 
edge of the abyss,” and demanded his removal from 
power: “It is shameful for proletarian revolutionaries to 



tolerate any longer Stalin’s yoke, his arbitrariness, his 
scorn for the Party and the laboring masses.”^ 

At a meeting of the Politburo Stalin called for Ryutin’s 
execution. Only Sergei Mironovich Kirov dared to 
contradict him. “We mustn’t do that!” he insisted. “Ryutin 
is not a hopeless case, he’s merely gone astray.” For the 
time being Stalin backed down and Ryutin was sentenced 
to ten years in jail.^ Five years later, during the Great 
Terror, when Stalin had gained the virtually unchallenged 
power of life and death over Soviet citizens, Ryutin was 
shot. 

During the early 1930s Stalin lost whatever capacity he 
had once possessed to distinguish personal opponents 
from “enemies of the people.” By far the most dangerous 
of these enemies, he believed, were the exiled Leon 
Trotsky (codenamed STARIK, “Old Man,” by the 
Centre)^ and his followers. “No normal ‘constitutional’ 
paths for the removal of the governing [Stalinist] clique 
now remain,” wrote Trotsky in 1933. “The only way to 
compel the bureaucracy to hand over power to the 
proletarian vanguard is by force.” Henceforth Stalin used 
that assertion to argue that the Soviet state was faced with 
a threat of forcible overthrow, which must itself be 
forcibly prevented.^ 

Opposition to Stalin resurfaced at the 1934 Party 
Congress, though in so muted a form that it passed 
unnoticed by the mass of the population. In the elections 



to the Central Committee, Stalin polled several hundred 
votes fewer than Kirov, who was assassinated, probably 
on Stalin’s orders, at the end of the year. What 
increasingly obsessed Stalin, however, were less the 
powerless remnants of real opposition to him than the 
gigantic, mythical conspiracy by imperialist secret 
services and their Trotskyist hirelings. Though the 
paranoid strain in what Khrushchev later called Stalin’s 
“sickly suspicious” personality does much to explain his 
obsession with conspiracy theory, there was an 
impeccable Leninist logic at the heart of that obsession. 
Stalin claimed Lenin’s authority for his insistence that it 
was impossible for the imperialists not to attempt to 
overthrow the world’s first and only worker-peasant state: 

We are living not only in a State, but in a system of 
States, and the existence of the Soviet Republic side 
by side with imperialist States is in the long run 
unthinkable. But until that end comes, a series of the 
most terrible clashes between the Soviet Republic 
and bourgeois States is unavoidable. 

It was equally inevitable, Stalin argued, that the enemies 
without would conspire with traitors within. Only “blind 
braggarts or concealed enemies of the people,” he 
declared, would dispute this elementary logic. ^ Those 
who disagreed thus automatically branded themselves as 
traitors. 



Despite Stalin’s increasing obsession during the 1930s 
with Trotskyist conspiracy, Trotsky never really 
represented any credible threat to the Stalinist regime. He 
spent his early years in exile trying vainly to find a 
European base from which to organize his followers. In 
1933 he left Turkey for France, then two years later 
moved on to Norway, but his political activity in all three 
countries was severely restricted by the reluctant host 
governments. In 1937, having finally despaired of finding 
a European headquarters, Trotsky left for Mexico, where 
he remained until his assassination three years later. The 
chief European organizer of the Trotskyist movement for 
most of the 1930s was not Trotsky himself but his elder 
son. Lev Sedov, who from 1933 was based in Paris. It was 
Sedov who, until his death in 1938, organized publication 
of his father’s Bulletin of the Opposition and maintained 
contact with Trotsky’s scattered supporters. Sedov’s 
entourage, like his father’s, was penetrated by the OGPU 
and NKVD. From 1934 onwards his closest confidant and 
collaborator in Paris was an NKVD agent, the Russian- 
born Polish Communist Mark Zborowski, known to 
Sedov as etienne and successively codenamed by the 
Center MAKS, MAK, TULIP and KANT. Sedov trusted 

r 

“Etienne” so completely that he gave him the key to his 
letterbox, allowed him to collect his mail and entrusted 
him with Trotsky’s most confidential files and archives 
for safekeeping.^ 



AS THE CHIEF headquarters of both the Trotskyist 
movement and the White Guards, Paris became for 
several years the main center of operations for the NKVD 
Administration for Special Tasks, headed by “Yasha” 
Serebryansky, which specialized in assassination and 
abduction. Serebryansky’ s illegal residency in Paris had 
other targets, too. The most prominent was the mercurial 
Jacques Doriot, a rabble-rousing orator who during the 
early 1930s was considered a likely future contender for 
the leadership of the French Communist Party. ^ In the 
early months of 1934, he aroused the ire of Moscow by 
calling on the Party to form an anti-fascist Popular Front 
with the socialists, still officially condemned in Moscow 
as “social fascists.” Doriot was summoned to Moscow to 
recant but refused to go. He was expelled from the Party 
for indiscipline in June 1934, ironically at the very 
moment when the Communist International, in a rapid 
volte-face instantly accepted by the French Communist 
Party, decided in favor of a Popular Front policy. 

Doriot responded with a series of increasingly bitter 
attacks on both Stalin’s “oriental” despotism and the 
French Communist leadership, whom he derided as 
“Stalin’s slaves.” The Centre, fearing the effect of 
Doriot’ s impassioned and now subversive oratory on the 
French left, ordered Serebryansky to keep him under 
continuous surveillance. In 1935, after almost the whole 
non-Communist press had publicized Doriot ’s revelation 
that the French Communist Party received secret 



instructions and funds from Moscow, the Centre 
instructed Serebryansky to draw up plans for his 
liquidation.^ The order to go ahead with the assassination 
seems never to have been given, perhaps because of the 
triumph of the Popular Front in the 1936 elections and 
Doriot’s foundation soon afterwards of the neofascist 
Parti Populaire Fran^ais. Doriot’s public vindication of 
the Communist charge that he was a fascist collaborator 
provided the Centre with a propaganda victory which his 
assassination would have spoiled rather than enhanced. 

Among other assassinations which Serebryansky was 
ordered to organize was that of the leading Nazi Hermann 
Goering, who was reported to be planning a visit to Paris. 
The Administration for Special Tasks ordered its Paris 
residency to recruit a sniper and find a way of infiltrating 
him into the airport, probably Le Bourget, at which 
Goering was expected to land. ^ ^ Goering, however, failed 
to visit France and the sniper was stood down. The files 
seen by Mitrokhin give no indication of the Centre’s 
motive in ordering an assassination which was 
undoubtedly authorized by Stalin himself. The probability 
is, however, that the main objective was to damage 
relations between France and Germany rather than to 
strike a blow against Nazism. The assassination on French 
soil in 1934 of the President of the Republic and the King 
of Yugoslavia by a non-Communist assassin doubtless 
encouraged the Centre to believe that it could avoid 



responsibility for the killing of Goering if an opportunity 
arose. 

Despite the numerous other duties of Serebryansky’s 
Paris residency, its main task remained the surveillance 
and destabilization of French Trotskyists. Until 1937 Lev 
Sedov, thanks to his misplaced but total confidence in 
“Etienne” Zborowski, was such an indispensable source 
on the POLECATS (as the Trotskyists were codenamed 
by the Centre) that he was not marked down as a target 
for liquidation.^^ In the autumn of 1936 Zborowski 
warned the Centre that, because of his financial problems, 
Trotsky was selling part of his archive (formerly among 
the papers entrusted by Sedov to Zborowski for 
safekeeping) to the Paris branch of the International 
Institute of Social History based in Amsterdam. 
Serebryansky was ordered to set up a task force to recover 
it, codenamed the HENRY group. He began by renting 
the flat immediately above the institute in the rue 
Michelet in order to keep it under surveillance. On 
Serebryansky’s instructions, Zborowski, then working as 
a service engineer at a Paris telephone exchange, was 
ordered to cause a fault on the Institute’s telephone line in 
order to give him a chance to reconnoitre the exact 
location of the Trotsky papers and examine the locks. 
When the Institute reported the fault on its line, however, 
one of Zborowski ’s colleagues was sent to mend the fault 
instead. Zborowski promptly put the Institute’s phone out 
of action once again and on this occasion was called to 



make the repair himself. As he left the Institute, having 
mended the fault and closely inspected the locks to the 
front and back doors, he was given a five franc tip by the 
director, Boris Nikolayevsky, a prominent Menshevik 
emigre classed by the NKVD as an “enemy of the 
people. 

Serebryansky fixed the time for the burglary at two 
o’clock on the morning of November 7, 1936, and 
ordered it to be completed by 5 a.m. at the latest. Since 
his agents were unable to find keys to fit the Institute 
locks, he decided to cut them out with a drill powered by 
an electric transformer concealed in a box filled with 
sawdust and cotton wool to deaden the sound. The 
burglars broke in unobserved and left with Trotsky’s 
papers. Both Sedov and the Paris police immediately 
suspected the NKVD because of both the professionalism 
of the burglary and the fact that money and valuables in 
the Institute had been left untouched. Sedov assured the 

r 

police that his assistant “Etienne” Zborowski was 
completely above suspicion, and in any case kept the 
main archive, which had not been stolen, at his home 
address. Ironically, Sedov suggested that the NKVD 
might have learned of the transfer of a part of the archive 
as the result of an indiscretion by the Institute director, 
Nikolayevsky.^^ 

The extraordinary importance attached by the Centre to 
the theft of the papers was demonstrated by the award of 



the Order of the Red Banner to the HENRY group. The 
operation, however, was as pointless as it was 
professional. The papers stolen from the Institute (many 
of them press cuttings) were of no operational 
significance whatever and of far less historical importance 
than the Trotsky archive which remained in Zborowski’s 
hands and later ended up at Harvard University. But by 
the mid- 1930s Stalin had lost all sense of proportion in his 
pursuit of Trotskyism in all its forms, both real and 
imaginary. Trotsky had become an obsession who 
dominated many of Stalin’s waking hours and probably 
interfered with his sleep at night. As Trotsky’s 
biographer, Isaac Deutscher, concludes: 

The frenzy with which [Stalin] pursued the feud, 
making it the paramount preoccupation of 
international communism as well as of the Soviet 
Union and subordinating to it all political, tactical, 
intellectual and other interests, beggars description; 
there is in the whole of history hardly another case in 
which such immense resources of power and 
propaganda were employed against a single 
individual. 

The British diplomat R. A. Sykes later wisely described 
Stalin’s world view as “a curious mixture of shrewdness 
and nonsense. Stalin’s shrewdness was apparent in the 
way that he outmaneuvered his rivals after the death of 



Lenin, gradually acquired absolute power as General 
Secretary, and later out-negotiated Churchill and 
Roosevelt during their wartime conferences. Historians 
have found it difficult to accept that so shrewd a man also 
believed in so much nonsense. But it is no more possible 
to understand Stalin without acknowledging his addiction 
to conspiracy theories about Trotsky (and others) than it is 
to comprehend Hitler without grasping the passion with 
which he pursued his even more terrible and absurd 
conspiracy theories about the Jews. 

GENRIKH GRIGORYEVICH YAGODA, head of the 
NKVD from 1934 to 1936, was far less obsessed by 
Trotsky than Stalin was. Stalin’s chief grudge against him 
was probably a growing conviction that he had been 
deliberately negligent in his hunt for Trotskyist traitors. 
His nemesis arrived in September 1936 in the form of a 
telegram from Stalin and his protege, Andrei Zhdanov, to 
the Central Committee declaring that Yagoda had 
“definitely proved himself incapable of unmasking the 
Trotskyite- Zinovyevite bloc” and demanding his 
replacement by Nikolai Ivanovich Yezhov. 

As head of the NKVD for the next two years, Yezhov 
carried through the largest scale peacetime political 
persecution and blood-letting in European history, known 
to posterity as the Great Terror.^ ^ One NKVD document 
from the Yezhov era, which doubtless reflected — and 
probably slavishly imitated — Stalin’s own view, asserted 



that “the scoundrel Yagoda” had deliberately concentrated 
the attack on the “lower ranks” of “the right-wing 
Trotskyite underground” in order to divert attention from 
its true leaders: Zinovyev, Bukharin, Rykov, Tomsky, 
Kamenev and Smirnov. Yagoda, it was claimed, had 
either sacked or sidelined NKVD staff who had tried to 
indict these former heroes of the Leninist era for their 
imaginary crimes. All save Tomsky, who committed 
suicide, were given starring roles in the show trials of 
1936 to 1938, gruesome morality plays which proclaimed 
a grotesque conspiracy theory uniting all opposition at 
home and abroad by the use of elegantly absurd formulae 
such as: “Trotskyism is a variety of fascism and 
Zinovyevism is a variety of Trotskyism.” In the last of the 
great show trials Yagoda, despite a plea for mercy written 
“on bended knees,” was himself unmasked as a leading 
Trotskyist conspirator. The chief author of the gigantic 
conspiracy theory, which became undisputed orthodoxy 
within the NKVD and provided the ideological 
underpinning of the Great Terror, was Stalin himself 
Stalin personally proofread the transcripts of the show 
trials before their publication, amending the defendants’ 
speeches to ensure that they did not deviate from their 
well-rehearsed confessions to imaginary conspiracies.^^ 
NKVD records of the period proclaim with characteristic 
obsequiousness that, “The practical organization of the 
work exposing the right-wing Trotskyite underground was 



supervised personally by Comrade Stalin, and in 1936-8 
crippling blows were delivered to the rabble. 

“Crippling blows” against both real and imaginary 
Trotskyist “rabble” were struck outside as well as inside 
the Soviet Union. The beginning of the Spanish Civil War 
in July 1936 opened up a major new field of operations 
for Serebryansky’s Administration for Special Tasks and 
for INO as a whole. The struggle of the Spanish 
republican government to defend itself against the 
nationalist rebellion led by General Francisco Franco fired 
the imagination of the whole of the European left as a 
crusade against international fascism: 35,000 foreign 
volunteers, most of them Communist, set out for Spain to 
join the International Brigades in defense of the republic. 
In October 1936 Stalin declared in an open letter to 
Spanish Communists: “Liberation of Spain from the yoke 
of the Spanish reactionaries is not the private concern of 
Spaniards alone, but the common cause of all progressive 
humanity.” From the outset, however, the NKVD was 
engaged in Spain in a war on two fronts: against 
Trotskyists within the republicans and the International 
Brigades, as well as against Franco and the nationalist 
forces. The former illegal resident in London, Aleksandr 
Orlov, sent to Spain as legal resident after the outbreak of 
the Civil War, confidently assured the Centre in October, 
“The Trotskyist organization POUM [Partido Obrero de 
Unificacion Marxista] can be easily liquidated. 



WHILE ORLOV COORDINATED the NKVD’s secret 
two-front war within Spain, Serebryansky conducted 
operations from abroad. Serebryansky organized training 
courses in Paris for saboteurs from the International 
Brigades, run by GIGI, a French Communist mechanic 
who usually worked without pay, FRANYA, a female 
Polish student paid 1,500 francs a month, and 
LEGRAND, on whom no further details are available. 
The greatest sabotage success reported by Serebryansky 
was the claim by the ERNST TOLSTY group of illegals, 
based in the Baltic and Scandinavia, to have sunk 
seventeen ships carrying arms to Franco. One of the 
leading saboteurs was a young German Communist, Ernst 
Wollweber, who twenty years later was to become head 
of the Stasi in East Germany.^^ An NKVD inquiry after 
the Civil War concluded, however, that some of the 
reports of sinkings were fabrications.^^ 

The main NKVD training grounds for guerrillas and 
saboteurs were within Spain itself at training camps 
supervised by Orlov at Valencia, Barcelona, Bilbao and 
Argen. Orlov later boasted of how his guerrilla platoons 
succeeded in blowing up power lines and bridges and in 
attacking enemy convoys far behind the nationalist lines. 
As an SVR-sponsored biography of Orlov acknowledges, 
his larger purpose was “to build up a secret police force 
under NKVD control to effect a Stalinization of Spain.” 
The chief Soviet military adviser in republican Spain, 



General Jan Berzin, formerly head of Red Army 
intelligence, complained that Orlov and the NKVD were 
treating republican Spain as a colony rather than an ally.^^ 
In the spring of 1937 Orlov and Serebryansky were 
ordered to move from the surveillance and destabilization 
of Trotskyist groups to the liquidation of their leaders. 
While Serebryansky began preparing the abduction of 
Sedov,^^ Orlov supplied the republican government with 
forged documents designed to discredit POUM as “a 
German-Francoist spy organization.” On June 16 the head 
of POUM, Andreu Nin, and forty leading members were 
arrested, its headquarters closed and its militia battalions 
disbanded. Less than a week later Nin disappeared from 
prison. An official investigation announced that he had 
escaped. In reality, he was abducted and murdered by a 
“mobile squad” of NKVD assassins, supervised by Orlov. 
Nin was one of many Trotskyists in Spain, both real and 
imagined, who met such fates. Until Orlov defected to the 
United States in 1938, fearing that he too had been placed 
on an NKVD death list, he lived in some luxury while 
organizing the liquidation of enemies of the people. A 
young volunteer in the International Brigades summoned 
to his presence was struck by how strongly he reeked of 
eau de cologne, and watched enviously as he consumed a 
large cooked breakfast wheeled in on a trolley by a 
whitecoated servant. Orlov offered none of it to the 
famished volunteer, who had not eaten for twenty-four 



hours. 

Though unusually forthcoming about Orlov, who, 
because of his defection, never qualified for the KGB 
Valhalla, the SVR has been much more reluctant to 
release material on the Spanish Civil War which might 
damage the reputation of the traditional heroes of Soviet 
foreign intelligence: among them Hero of the Soviet 
Union Stanislav Alekseyevich Vaupshasov, long 
celebrated for his daring exploits behind enemy lines 
during the Second World War. With four Orders of Lenin, 
two Orders of the Great Patriotic War and a chestfiil of 
other medals, Vaupshasov was probably the Soviet 
Union’s most profusely decorated intelligence hero. As 
recently as 1990 he was honored by a commemorative 
postage stamp. Vaupshasov’ s murderous pre-war record, 
however, is still kept from public view by the SVR. In the 
mid- 1920s he led a secret OGPU unit in numerous raids 
on Polish and Lithuanian border villages, dressed in 
Polish and Lithuanian army uniforms. In 1929 
Vaupshasov was sentenced to death for murdering a 
colleague, but managed to have the sentence commuted to 
ten years in the gulag. He was quickly released and 
resumed his career as one of the NKVD’s leading experts 
in assassination. Among Vaupshasov’ s duties in Spain 
was the construction and guarding of a secret 
crematorium which enabled the NKVD to dispose of its 
victims without leaving any trace of their remains. Many 
of those selected for liquidation were lured into the 



building containing the crematorium and killed on the 
spot.^^ 

The NKVD agent in charge of the crematorium was 
Jose Castelo Pacheco (codenamed JOSE, PANSO and 
TEODOR), a Spanish Communist bom in Salamanca in 
1910, who was recmited by Orlov’s deputy resident, 
Leonid Aleksandrovich Eitingon, in 1936.^^ In 1982, 
some years after Castelo ’s death, the KGB received a 
letter from a female relative appealing for a pension and 
claiming that he had told her before his death, “If you 
have any problems and there is no other way out, I mean 
only in extreme circumstances, then contact my Soviet 
comrades.” Though Castelo ’s file showed that he had 
promised never to reveal any details of his work as a 
Soviet agent, there was an obvious risk that his relative 
had discovered his work in the NKVD crematorium. The 
Centre therefore concluded that to refuse her request 
might have “undesirable consequences.” In January 1983 
she was summoned to the consular department of the 
Soviet embassy in Madrid by the resident and told that, 
though she had no legal right to a pension, it had been 
decided to make her an ex gratia payment of 5,000 
convertible roubles, then the equivalent of 6,680 US 
dollars. No reference was made to Castelo ’s work for the 
NKVD.3^ 


REMARKABLY, MANY OTHERWISE admirable 



studies of the Stalin era fail to mention the relentless 
secret pursuit of “enemies of the people” in western 
Europe. The result, all too frequently, is a sanitized, 
curiously bloodless interpretation of Soviet foreign policy 
on the eve of the Second World War which fails to 
recognize the priority given to assassination. Outside 
Spain, the main theater of operations for the NKVD’s 
assassins was France, where their chief targets were Lev 
Sedov and General Yevgeni Karlovich Miller, Kutepov’s 
successor as head of the White Guard ROVS. In the 
summer of 1937 Serebryansky devised similar plans to 
liquidate both. Sedov and Miller were each to be 
kidnapped in Paris, smuggled on board a boat waiting off 
the Channel coast, then brought to the Soviet Union for 
interrogation and retribution. The first stage in the 
abduction operations was the penetration of their 
entourages. 

r 

Like Sedov’s assistant “Etienne” Zborowski, Miller’s 
deputy. General Nikolai Skoblin, was an NKVD agent. 
Probably unknown to Skoblin, Serebryansky also used an 
illegal, Mireille Lyudvigovna Abbiate (codenamed 
AVIATORSHA, “aviator’s wife”), to keep Miller under 
surveillance. Abbiate was the daughter of a French music 
teacher in St. Petersburg, bom and brought up in Russia. 
When her family returned to France in 1920, she had 
stayed in Russia and married the aviator Vasili Ivanovich 
Yermolov (hence her later codename). In 1931, when she 
traveled to France to visit her parents, she was recmited 



by the NKVD. During her visit she recruited her brother, 
Roland Lyudvigovich Abbiate, who also became an 
illegal with the codename LETCHIK (“pilot”). 
AVIATORS HA rented a flat next to General Miller, 
secretly forced an entry, stole some of his papers and 
installed a hidden microphone which enabled her to bug 
his apartment.^^ On September 22, 1937, like Kutepov 
seven years earlier. Miller disappeared in broad daylight 
on a Paris street. The Surete later concluded that Miller 
had been taken to the Soviet embassy, killed and his body 
placed in a large trunk which was then taken by a Ford 
truck to be loaded on a Soviet freighter waiting at Le 
Havre. Several witnesses reported seeing the trunk being 
loaded on board. Miller, however, was still alive inside 
the trunk, heavily drugged. Unlike Kutepov in 1930, he 
survived the voyage to Moscow, where he was 
interrogated and shot. Skoblin, who fell under immediate 
suspicion by Miller’s supporters, fled to Spain.^^ Mireille 
Abbiate, whose role went undetected, was awarded the 
Order of the Red Star, then reassigned to the operation 
against Sedov.^^ 

Planning for the abduction of Sedov was at an 
advanced stage by the time Miller disappeared. A fishing 
boat had been hired at Boulogne to take him on the first 
stage of his journey to the Soviet Union.^^ The operation, 
however, was aborted — possibly as a result of the furor 
aroused in France by the NKVD’s suspected involvement 



in Miller’s abduction. A few months later Sedov met a 
different end. On February 8, 1938 he entered hospital 
with acute appendicitis. “Etienne” Zborowski helped to 
persuade him that, to avoid NKVD surveillance, he must 
have his appendix removed not at a French hospital but at 
a small private clinic run by Russian emigres, which was 
in reality an easier target for Soviet penetration. No 
sooner had Zborowski ordered the ambulance than, as he 
later admitted, he alerted the NKVD. But, for alleged 
security reasons, he refused to reveal the address of the 
clinic to French Trotskyists. Sedov’s operation was 
successful and for a few days he seemed to be making a 
normal recovery. Then he had a sudden relapse which 
baffled his doctors. Despite repeated blood transfusions, 
he died in great pain on February 16 at the age of only 
thirty-two. The contemporary files contain no proof that 
the NKVD was responsible for his death.^^ It had, 
however, a sophisticated medical section, the Kamera, 
which experimented with lethal drugs and was capable of 
poisoning Sedov. It is certain that the NKVD intended to 
assassinate Sedov, just as it planned to kill Trotsky and 
his other leading lieutenants. What remains in doubt is 
whether Sedov was murdered by the NKVD in February 
1938 or whether he died of natural causes before he could 
be assassinated.^^ 

Sedov’s death enabled the NKVD to take a leading role 
in the Trotskyist organization. Zborowski became both 
publisher of the Bulletin of the Opposition and Trotsky’s 



most important contact with his European supporters. 
While unobtrusively encouraging internecine warfare 
between the rival Trotskyist tendencies, Zborowski 
impeccably maintained his own cover. On one occasion 
he wrote to tell Trotsky that the Bulletin was about to 
publish an article entitled “Trotsky’s Life in Danger,” 
which would expose the activities of NKVD agents in 
Mexico. In the summer of 1938 the defector Aleksandr 
Orlov, then living in the United States, sent Trotsky an 
anonymous letter warning him that his life was in danger 
from an NKVD agent in Paris. Orlov did not know the 
agent’s surname but said that his first name was Mark (the 
real first name of “Etienne” Zborowski), and gave a 
detailed description of his appearance and background. 
Trotsky suspected that this letter and others like it were 
the work of NKVD agents provocateurs. Zborowski 
agreed. When told about one of the accusations against 
him, he is reported as having given “a hearty laugh.”^^ 
Following the death of Sedov, the NKVD’s next major 
Trotskyist target in Europe was the German Rudolf 
Klement, secretary of Trotsky’s Fourth International, 
whose founding conference was due to be held later in the 
year.^^ On July 13, 1938 the NKVD abducted Klement 
from his Paris home. A few weeks later his headless 
corpse was washed ashore on the banks of the Seine. The 
founding conference of the Fourth International in 
September was a tragicomic event, attended by only 
twenty-one delegates claiming to represent mostly 



minuscule Trotskyist groups in eleven countries. The 
Russian section, whose authentic members had probably 
been entirely exterminated, was represented by 
Zborowski. The American Trotskyist Sylvia Angeloff, 
one of the conference translators, was accompanied by her 
Spanish lover, Ramon Mercader, an NKVD illegal posing 
as a Belgian journalist who was later to achieve fame as 
Trotsky’s assassin in Mexico City.^^ 

BY 1938 SEREBRYANSKY’S Administration for 
Special Tasks was the largest section of Soviet foreign 
intelligence, claiming to have 212 illegal officers 
operating in sixteen countries: the USA, France, Belgium, 
Holland, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Germany, 
Latvia, Estonia, Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, 
Czechoslovakia and China. After Trotskyists, the largest 
number of “enemies of the people” pursued abroad by the 
NKVD during the Great Terror came from the ranks of its 
own foreign intelligence service.^^ When receiving 
reports from Moscow of show trials and the unmasking of 
their colleagues as agents of imperialist powers, 
intelligence officers stationed abroad had to pay careful 
attention not merely to what they said but also to their 
facial expressions and body language. Those who failed 
to respond with sufficiently visible or heartfelt outrage to 
the non-existent conspiracies being unveiled in Moscow 
were likely to have adverse reports sent to the Centre — 
frequently with fatal consequences. 



After the trial of Lenin’s former lieutenants Zinovyev, 
Kamenev and other “degenerates” in August 1936, the 
Centre received an outraged communication from the 
Paris legal residency regarding the unsatisfactory level of 
indignation displayed by the military intelligence officer 
Abram Mironovich Albam (codenamed BELOV): 

BELOV does not appear to feel a deep hatred or a 
sharply critical attitude towards these political 
bandits. During discussions of the trial of the 
Trotskyite-Zinovyevite bandits, he retreats into 
silence. BELOV was hoping that the sixteen 
convicted men would be shown mercy, and, when he 
read about their execution in the newspaper today, he 
actually sighed.^^ 

Albam ’s subversive sigh helped to convict not merely 
himself but also a number of his colleagues of imaginary 
crimes. His file lists thirteen of his acquaintances who 
were subsequently arrested; at least some, probably most, 
were shot. Albam’ s wife, Frida Lvovna, tried to save 
herself by disowning her arrested husband. “The most 
horrible realization for an honest Party member,” she 
wrote indignantly to the NKVD, “is the fact that he was 
an enemy of the people surrounded by other enemies of 
the people. 

Both at home and abroad the Great Terror favored the 
survival of the most morally unfit. Those who were 



quickest to denounce their colleagues for imaginary 
crimes stood the greatest chance of being among the 
minority of survivors. The fact that Yakov Surits, 
ambassador in Berlin at the beginning of the Great Terror, 
was one of the few senior diplomats to survive may well 
have owed something to his expertise in denunciation. 
Surits sought to head off denunciation by the head of the 
legal residency in his embassy, B. M. Gordon, by 
denouncing Gordon first. At the outset of the Terror, 
Surits drew to the attention of the Centre that a Soviet 
diplomat with whom Gordon was on friendly terms was a 
former Socialist Revolutionary who frequently visited 
relatives in Prague “where other SR emigres reside. 
After the show trial of the “Trotskyite-Zinovyevite 
Terrorist Center” in January 1937, Surits reported 
disturbing evidence of Gordon’s Trotskyite sympathies: 

On February 2 a Party meeting was held in the Berlin 
embassy. Gordon, B. M., the resident and 
Communist Party organizer, delivered a report on the 
trial of the Trotskyite Center. 

Gordon did not say a word about the fact that his 
rabble of bandits had a specific program of action; he 
did not say why this scum hid its program from the 
working class and from all working people; why it 
led a double life; why it went deeply underground. 

He did not dwell on the reasons why after all the 
enemies managed to cause damage for so many 



years. 

He did not deal with the question why, despite 
wrecking, sabotage, terrorism and espionage, our 
industry and transport constantly made progress and 
continue to make progress. 

He did not touch on the international significance 
of the trial. 

Surits, however, was unaware that he was himself being 
simultaneously denounced for similar failings by one of 
his secretaries, who wrote virtuously to the Centre: 

To this day the office of Comrade Surits is adorned 
with a portrait of Bukharin with the following 
inscription: “To my dear Surits, my old friend and 
comrade, with love — ^N. Bukharin.” I deliberately do 
not take it down, not because I greatly enjoy looking 
at it, but because I want to avoid the cross looks 
which Comrade Surits gave me when I removed the 
portrait of Yenukidze. 

I am waiting for him to remove it himself, since if 
Bukharin was indeed once his close friend, he must 
now be his enemy, as he has become the enemy of 
our Party and of the whole working class. The 
portrait should immediately have been thrown into 
the fire. 

That, really, is all that I considered it my Party 
duty to report to you. After the adoption of the Stalin 



Constitution [of 1936] which has granted us great 
rights and put us under great obligations, calling us 
to exercise discipline, honest work and vigilance, I 
could not remain silent about these facts. 

In 1937-8, following the recall and liquidation of all or 
most of their officers, many NKVD residencies ceased to 
function. Though the residencies in London, Berlin, 
Vienna and Tokyo did not close, they were reduced to one 
or, at the most, two officers each.^^ Most of the Great 
Illegals were purged with the rest. Among the first to fall 
under suspicion was the London head of probably the 
NKVD’s most successful illegal residency, Teodor Maly, 
whose religious background and revulsion at the use of 
terror made him an obvious suspect. He accepted the 
order to return to Moscow in June 1937 with an idealistic 
fatalism. ‘T know that as a former priest I haven’t got a 
chance,” he told Aleksandr Orlov. “But I have decided to 
go there so that nobody can say: ‘That priest might have 
been a real spy after all.’ Once in Moscow he was 
denounced as a German spy, interrogated and shot a few 
months later. Moisei Akselrod, head of the illegal 
residency in Italy and controller of DUNCAN, the most 
productive source of intelligence on Britain during the 
previous decade, was also recalled to Moscow. After a 
brief period in limbo, he too was executed as an enemy of 
the people. 



Amid the paranoia of the Great Terror, Arnold 
Deutsch’s Jewish- Austrian origins and unorthodox early 
career made him automatically suspect in the Centre. 
After the recall of Maly, Akselrod and other illegals, he 
must have feared that his own turn would not be long in 
coming. In an effort to extend his visa he had recently 
contacted a Jewish relative in Birmingham, Oscar 
Deutsch, president of a local synagogue and managing 
director of Odeon Theatres. Arnold sometimes visited his 
Birmingham relatives for Friday night sabbath dinners, 
and Oscar promised to provide work to enable him to stay 
in Britain. These contacts doubtless added to the 
suspicions of the Centre. 

Remarkably, however, Deutsch survived. He may well 
have owed his survival to the defection in July 1937 of a 
Paris-based NKVD illegal, Ignace Poretsky (alias Reiss, 
codenamed RAYMOND). Poretsky was tracked down in 
Switzerland by a French illegal in the “Serebryansky 
Service,” Roland Abbiate (alias “Rossi,” codenamed 
LETCHIK), whose sister Mireille, also in the 
“Serebryansky Service,” was simultaneously preparing 
the abduction of General Miller in Paris. To lure 
Poretsky to his death, Abbiate used one of his friends, 
Gertrude Schildbach, a German Communist refugee who 
was persuaded to write to Poretsky to say that she 
urgently needed his advice. Schildbach refused a request 
to give Poretsky a box of chocolates laced with strychnine 
(later recovered by the Swiss police), but enticed him into 



a side-road near Lausanne where Abbiate was waiting 
with a machine-gun. At the last moment Poretsky realized 
that he was being led into a trap and tried to grab hold of 
Schildbach. His bullet-ridden body was later discovered, 
clutching in one hand a strand of her greying hair.^^ 

The NKVD damage assessment after Poretsky’ s 
defection concluded that he had probably betrayed 
Deutsch, with whom he had been stationed in Paris a few 
years earlier, to Western intelligence services. Deutsch’ s 
classification as a victim of Trotskyite and Western 
conspiracy helped to protect him from charges of being 
part of that conspiracy. He was recalled to Moscow in 
November 1937, not, like Maly, to be shot, but because 
the Centre believed he had been compromised by 
Poretsky and other traitors. 

The liquidation of Maly and recall of Deutsch did 
severe and potentially catastrophic damage to the 
NKVD’s British operations. All contact was broken with 
Captain King (MAG), the cipher clerk in the Foreign 
Office recruited in 1935, since the NKVD damage 
assessment absurdly concluded that Maly “had betrayed 
MAG to the enemy. The files noted by Mitrokhin do 
not record what the damage assessment concluded about 
the Cambridge recruits, but, since Maly knew all their 
names, there were undoubtedly fears that they too had 
been compromised. Those fears must surely have been 
heightened by the defection in November of Walter 



Krivitsky, the illegal resident in the Netherlands. Though 
Krivitsky seems not to have known the names of any of 
the Cambridge Five, he knew some details about them, 
including the fact that one of them was a young journalist 
who had been sent to Spain with a mission to assassinate 
Franco. 

After Deutsch’s recall to Moscow, the three members 
of the Five who remained in England — Burgess, Blunt 
and Caimcross — were out of direct contact with the 
Centre for nine months. They were so highly motivated, 
however, that they continued to work for the NKVD even 
as the illegal residency which had controlled them was 
disintegrating. Burgess, who had been allowed by 
Deutsch and Maly to consider himself an NKVD officer 
rather than an agent wholly dependent on instructions 
from his controller, continued recruiting agents on his 
own initiative. He saw himself as continuing and 
developing Deutsch’s strategy of recruiting bright 
students at Oxford as well as Cambridge who could 
penetrate Whitehall. 

Burgess intended his chief talent- spotter at Oxford to 
be Goronwy Rees, a young Welsh Fellow of All Souls 
and assistant editor of the Spectator. Rees had first met 
Burgess in 1932 and, though resisting Burgess’s attempt 
to seduce him, had none the less been deeply impressed 
by him: “It seemed to me that there was something deeply 
original, something which was, as it were, his very own in 
everything he had to say.”^^ It was probably a book 



review by Rees late in 1937 which persuaded Burgess that 
he was ready for recruitment. The misery of mass 
unemployment in south Wales, wrote Rees, was 

misery of a special and peculiar kind ... and to many 
people it implies a final condemnation of the society 
which has produced it ... If you tell men and women, 
already inclined by temperament and tradition to 
revolutionary opinions, that their sufferings are 
caused by an impersonal economic system, you leave 
them but one choice. Lenin could not do better. 

One evening, probably at the beginning of 1938, sitting 
in Rees’s flat with, as usual, a bottle of whiskey between 
them, Burgess told him that his Spectator review showed 
that he had “the heart of the matter in him.” Then, 
according to Rees, he added with unusual solemnity, “I 
am a Comintern agent and have been ever since I came 
down from Cambridge. In later years Rees was to try 
to give the impression that he did not agree to become an 
agent. His KGB file makes clear that he was recruited — 
though it confirms that Burgess asked him not to work for 
the NKVD but “to help the Party. As an NKVD case 
officer with whom Burgess made contact later in the year 
reported to the Centre, he regarded Rees (henceforth 
codenamed FLEET or GROSS) as a key part of his 
Oxbridge recruitment strategy: 



The kind of work which he would do with great 
moral satisfaction and with absolute confidence in its 
success and effectiveness is the recruitment by us of 
young people graduating from Oxford and 
Cambridge Universities and preparing them to enter 
the civil service. For this kind of work he has such 
assistants as TONY [Blunt] in Cambridge and 
GROSS [Rees] in Oxford. MADCHEN [Burgess] 
always returns to this idea at every meeting ...^^ 

Though unhappy with Burgess’s undisciplined recruiting 
methods, the Centre regarded Rees as potentially an 
important agent. Three of Britain’s leading appeasers — 
Lord Halifax, the Foreign Secretary; Sir John Simon, then 
Home Secretary; and Geoffrey Dawson, editor of The 
Times — were nonresident Fellows of All Souls. The 
Center attached exaggerated importance to the fact that 
Rees met all three from time to time on high table. It also 
overestimated the influence of Rees’s friend Sir Ernest 
Swinton, a retired major-general who had been Chichele 
Professor of Military History since 1925 and was referred 
to by the Centre as “General Swinton. 

WHILE BURGESS WAS pressing ahead enthusiastically 
with his Oxbridge recruitment strategy, INO was in 
turmoil. On February 17, 1938 its head, Abram Slutsky, 
was found dead in his office, allegedly from a heart 
attack. But at his lying in state in the NKVD officers’ 



club, his senior staff noticed on his face the tell-tale signs 
of cyanide poisoning. Yagoda, meanwhile, was 
confessing at his trial to working for the German, 
Japanese and Polish intelligence services, to poisoning his 
predecessor, Menzhinsky, and to attempting to poison his 
successor, Yezhov.^^ By the end of the year, Slutsky’s 
two immediate successors as head of INO, Zelman Pasov 
and Mikhail Shpigelglas, had also been shot as enemies of 
the people. INO collapsed into such confusion during 
1938 that for 127 consecutive days not a single foreign 
intelligence report was forwarded to Stalin.^^ In 
December Yezhov was replaced as head of the NKVD by 
Lavrenti Pavlovich Beria; a few months later he was 
accused of treasonable conspiracy with Britain, Germany, 
Japan and Poland. As NKVD officers went home in the 
evening, each one must have wondered whether the knock 
at the door in the early hours would signal that his own 
doom was nigh. 

Most of the INO officers who were interrogated and 
brutally tortured during the late 1930s in the name of the 
vast conspiracy theories of Stalin and his NKVD chiefs 
did not live to tell the tale. One of the few who did was 
the first of the Great Illegals, Dmitri Bystroletov. In 1937 
Bystroletov had been sent on a mission to Berlin to 
contact a Soviet agent on the Reichswehr general staff. He 
later claimed that, before he left, he was embraced by 
Yezhov. “Be proud that we have given you one of our 



best sources,” Yezhov told him. “Stalin and your 
fatherland will not forget you.”^^ Early in 1938, however, 
Bystroletov was suspended from duty and transferred to 
the Moscow Chamber of Commerce, where he worked 
until his arrest in September.^^ During Bystroletov’ s 
interrogation by Colonel Solovyev, Yezhov entered the 
room and asked what he was accused of. When told he 
was charged with spying for four foreign powers, Yezhov 
replied “Too few!”, turned on his heels and left.^^ 

When Bystroletov refused to confess to his imaginary 
crimes, Solovyev and his assistant, Pushkin, beat him 
with a ball-bearing on the end of an iron rope, breaking 
two of his ribs and penetrating a lung. His skull was 
fractured by one of the other instruments of torture, a 
hammer wrapped in cotton wool and bandages, and his 
stomach muscles tom by repeated kicks from his 
interrogators. Convinced that he would die if the beating 
continued, Bystroletov signed a confession dictated to 
him by Solovyev. For most INO officers, torture and 
confession to imaginary crimes were followed by a short 
walk to an execution chamber and a bullet in the back of 
the head. Bystroletov, however, survived to write an 
account of his interrogation. Though sentenced to twenty 
years’ imprisonment in 1939, he was rehabilitated during 
the Second World War. By the time he was released, his 
wife, Shelmatova, sent to the gulag as the spouse of an 
enemy of the people, had killed herself by cutting her 



throat with a kitchen knife. His elderly mother poisoned 
herself. 

AFTER THE DISINTEGRATION of the London illegal 
residency following the liquidation of Maly and the recall 
of Deutsch, the Centre planned to hand over the running 
of its main British agents to the legal residency at the 
Soviet embassy in Kensington. In April 1938 a new 
resident, Grigori Grafpen (codenamed SAM), arrived to 
take charge. The massacre of many of the most 
experienced INO officers had a dramatic effect on the 
quality of NKVD tradecraft. Deutsch, Orlov and Maly 
had taken elaborate precautions to avoid surveillance 
before meeting their agents. But an inexperienced 
emissary from the Centre who came to inspect Graven’s 
residency had so little idea about tradecraft that he 
assumed it was safe to operate in the immediate environs 
of the embassy. He reported naively to Moscow, “Next to 
the Embassy there is a park [Kensington Gardens] which 
is convenient ... for holding meetings with agents, as one 
can simply give the appearance of having gone out for a 
walk in this park.”^^ 

Graven’s first priority was to renew contact with 
Donald Maclean, then the most productive of the 
Cambridge Five and able to smuggle large numbers of 
classified documents out of the Foreign Office. On April 
10 a young and apparently inexperienced female NKVD 



officer, codenamed NORMA, met Maclean in the Empire 
Cinema in Leicester Square. A few days later Maclean 
came to NORMA ’s flat with a large bundle of Foreign 
Office documents which she photographed, before giving 
the undeveloped film to Grafpen for shipment to Moscow. 
Either on that occasion or soon afterwards, the young 
British agent and his Soviet case officer followed the 
photography session by going to bed together. In defiance 
of her instructions, NORMA also told Maclean, probably 
in bed, that his current codename (which he was not 
supposed to know) was LYRIC. 

In September 1938 Maclean left for his first foreign 
posting as third secretary in the Paris embassy, preceded 
by an effusive testimonial from the Foreign Office 
personnel department: 

Maclean, who is the son of the late Sir Donald 
Maclean ... has done extremely well during his first 
two years here and is one of the mainstays of the 
Western Department. He is a very nice individual 
indeed and has plenty of brains and keenness. He is, 
too, nice-looking and ought, we think, to be a 
success in Paris from the social as well as the work 
point of view.^^ 

As Maclean was leaving for Paris, the Munich crisis was 
reaching its humiliating climax with the surrender of the 
Czech Sudetenland to Nazi Germany. On September 30 



the British prime minister, Neville Chamberlain, returned 
to a hero’s welcome in London, brandishing the worthless 
piece of paper bearing Hitler’s signature which, he 
claimed, meant not only “peace with honor” but “peace 
for our time.” For the Cambridge Five, incapable of 
imagining that less than a year later Stalin would sign a 
pact with Hitler, Munich was further confirmation of the 
justice of their cause. 

During the Munich crisis Caimcross had access to 
Foreign Office files containing what Burgess described as 
“the very best information imaginable” on British policy, 
which he passed to the NKVD via Klugmann and 
Burgess. Caimcross ’s documents on the attempted 
appeasement of Germany, which reached its nadir with 
the Munich agreement, were used by the Centre to 
provide further evidence for the conspiracy theory that the 
secret aim of British foreign policy, supported by the 
French, was “to lure Germany into an attack on Russia.” 
Though the chief advocate of this theory was Stalin, it 
was also fervently espoused by INO. Throughout the Cold 
War, the claim that Britain’s aim at Munich had been not 
merely to appease Hitler but also to drive him into a 
conflict with the Soviet Union remained unchallenged 
orthodoxy among KGB historians. As late as the mid- 
1990s, Yuri Modin, the post-war controller of the Five, 
was still insisting that, “This claim was neither 
propaganda nor disinformation but the unvarnished tmth, 
proven by the documents obtained for us by Burgess” 



(chiefly, no doubt, from Caimcross).^^ 

After Maclean’s posting to Paris during the Munich 
crisis, Caimcross was intended by the Centre to succeed 
him as its chief source within the Foreign Office. The 
London resident. Graven, bungled the transition. 
Caimcross ’s prickly personality and lack of social graces 
had not won the same encomiums from his colleagues or 
the Foreign Office personnel department as Maclean’s 
more patrician manner. In December 1938 he moved to 
the Treasury. At almost the same moment as 
Caimcross ’s departure for the Treasury, though for 
unconnected reasons, Grafpen was recalled to Moscow. 
Given the atmosphere of the time, he may actually have 
been relieved, after being “unmasked” as a Trotskyist on 
his arrival, to be sentenced to only five years in a labor 
camp rather than being led to an execution cellar in the 
Lubyanka basement. En route for Moscow in December 
1938, Grafpen accompanied NORMA (renamed ADA 
since her earlier indiscretion) to Paris where she was due 
to resume contact with Maclean. ADA reported that 
Maclean was having an affair with an American student at 
the Sorbonne, Melinda Marling, whom he was later to 
marry. She also discovered that Maclean, now drinking 
heavily, had admitted that while dmnk he had told both 
his mistress and his brother that he was working for 
Soviet intelligence.^^ ADA remained in Paris, filming the 
documents provided by Maclean from embassy files, then 



passing the film to an illegal codenamed FORD for 
transmission to the Centre. 

The news in December 1938 of Maclean’s drunken 
security lapse was balanced by a spectacular success. In 
the same month Burgess reported, probably via Paris, that 
he had succeeded in joining the Secret Intelligence 
Service. He had been taken on by SIS’s newest branch. 
Section D, founded earlier in the year to devise dirty 
tricks ranging from sabotage to psychological warfare 
(delicately described as ways of “attacking potential 
enemies by means other than the operations of military 
force”) for use in a future war.^^ Instead of being elated 
by the news, however, the Centre appeared almost 
paralyzed by fear and suspicion. 

THE EXPOSURE OF two London illegal residents, Reif 
and Maly, and the legal resident. Graven, as imaginary 
enemy agents, combined with the defection of Orlov, put 
the entire future of intelligence operations in Britain in 
doubt. The illegal residency had been wound up and, with 
one exception, the staff of the legal residency were 
recalled to Moscow. The only remaining INO officer in 
London, Anatoli Veniaminovich Gorsky, was poorly 
briefed about even the most important British agents. In 
the summer of 1939, when Philby was due to return to 
London after the end of the Spanish Civil War, Gorsky 
told the Centre, “When you give us orders on what to do 



with SOHNCHEN, we would appreciate some orientation 
on him, for he is known to us only in the most general 
terms. 

An assessment in the Centre concluded that intelligence 
work in Britain “was based on doubtful sources, on an 
agent network acquired at the time when it was controlled 
by enemies of the people and was therefore extremely 
dangerous.” It concluded with a recommendation to break 
contact with all British agents — the Five included. 
Though contact was not yet broken, the Five seem to have 
been held at arm’s length for most of 1939. Intelligence 
from them was accepted, often without any visible interest 
in it, while the Centre continued to debate the possibility 
that some or all were agents provocateurs. ADA reported 
that Philby “frequently” complained to Maclean about the 
NKVD’s lack of contact with, and interest in, him.^^ Fitzi 
Philby (MARY) and Edith Tudor Hart (EDITH), who 
were used by Burgess and others as couriers to make 
contact with the NKVD in Paris in 1938-9, grumbled that 
their expenses were not being paid. Gorsky reported to the 
Centre in July 1939: 

MARY announced that, as a result of a four-month 
hiatus in communications with her, we owe her and 
MADCHEN £65. 1 promised to check at home [the 
Centre] and gave him £30 in advance, since she said 
they were in material need ... MARY continues to 
live in [France] and for some reason, she says on our 



orders, maintains a large flat and so on there. 


The Centre replied: 

At one time, when it was necessary, MARY was 
given orders to keep a flat in Paris. That is no longer 
necessary. Have her get rid of the flat and live more 
modestly, since we will not pay. MARY should not 
be paid £65, since we do not feel that we owe her, 
for anything. We confirm the payment of £30. Tell 
her that we will pay no more.^^ 

To a remarkable degree, however, the ideological 
commitment of the main British agents survived the 
turmoil in the Centre. In 1938 Burgess recruited one of 
his lovers, Eric Kessler, a Swiss journalist turned 
diplomat on the staff of the Swiss embassy in London. 
Later codenamed OREND and SHVEYTSARETS 
(“Swiss”), Kessler proved a valuable source on Swiss- 
German relations. Probably in 1939, Burgess recruited 
another foreign lover, the Hungarian Andrew Revoi, later 
leader of the exiled Free Hungarians in wartime London. 
Codenamed TAFFY (“Toffee”), he was described in his 
KGB file as a pederast; the same source also claimed that 
he had “had homosexual relations with a Foreign Office 
official.” Ironically, in 1942 Burgess was also to recruit 
Revoi as an MI5 source. 

Kim and Litzi Philby, still good comrades according to 



KGB files though they both now had different partners, 
made a probably even more important recruitment in 
1939: that of the Austrian journalist H. P. Smolka, whom 
Litzi had known in Vienna. Soon after the Nazi 
Anschluss, which united Austria with Germany in 1938, 
Smolka became a naturalized British subject with the 
name of Peter Smollett. Codenamed ABO by the Centre, 
Smollett later succeeded in becoming head of the Russian 
section in the wartime Ministry of Information.^^ 

The signature of the Nazi-Soviet Non- Aggression Pact 
in Moscow on August 23, 1939 was an even bigger blow 
to the morale of the NKVD’s British agents than the 
turmoil in the Centre. Exchanging toasts with Hitler’s 
foreign minister, Joachim von Ribbentrop, Stalin told 
him, ‘T can guarantee, on my word of honor, that the 
Soviet Union will not betray its partner.” The ideological 
agents recruited during the 1930s had been motivated, at 
least in part, by the desire to fight fascism. Most, after 
varying degrees of inner turmoil, overcame their sense of 
shocked surprise at the conclusion of the Nazi-Soviet 
Pact. Over the previous few years, they had become 
sufficiently indoctrinated, often self-indoctrinated, in 
Stalinist double-think to perform the intellectual 
somersaults required to sustain their commitment to the 
vision of the Soviet Union as the world’s first worker- 
peasant state, the hope of progressive mankind. 

A minority of the ideological agents in the West, 
however, were so sickened by the Nazi-Soviet Pact that 



they ended their connection with the NKVD. The most 
important of those who broke contact in Britain was 
FLEET, Goronwy Rees. During a visit to Moscow in 
1993, Rees’s daughter Jenny was informed, accurately, 
during a briefing by an SVR representative that Rees had 
refused to cooperate after the Pact: “We hear no more of 
him after that.” At the end of the briefing, Jenny Rees 
asked perceptively: “You know something else, do you, 
about Rees that you are not going to tell me?”^^ The SVR 
did indeed. The most important of the secrets that the 
SVR was unwilling to reveal was that Burgess, by now an 
SIS officer, panicked when Rees decided to break away, 
sent an urgent message to the Centre warning that Rees 
might betray both himself and Blunt, and asked for Rees 
to be assassinated. The Centre refused. Rees’s KGB file, 
however, records that he did not betray Burgess and Blunt 
because of his “old friendship” with Burgess. In an 
attempt to make betrayal less likely, Burgess told Rees 
that he too had been disillusioned by the Nazi-Soviet Pact 
and had ended illegal work for the Communist Party.^^ 
Maclean was also deeply worried by Rees’s “defection.” 
Years later, as he was beginning to crack under the strain 
of his double life as British diplomat and Soviet agent, he 
spat at Rees: “You used to be one of us, but you ratted! 

The doubts about Moscow felt by some of the NKVD’s 
British agents after the Nazi-Soviet Pact were more than 
matched by the Centre’s doubts about its agents. The 



Center launched an investigation into the possibility that 
Philby was either a German or a British agent. Since 
Philby had provided the original leads which led to the 
recruitment of Burgess and Maclean, and ultimately to all 
the Cambridge recruits, doubts about him reflected on the 
whole British agent network. The lowest point in the 
history of NKVD operations in Britain came at the 
beginning of 1940 when Gorsky, the last member of the 
London legal residency, was withdrawn to Moscow, 
leaving not a single NKVD officer active in Britain. A file 
in the KGB archives records, “The residency was 
disbanded on the instruction of Beria [head of the 
NKVD].”^^ Beria’ s reasons are not recorded, at least in 
the files examined by Mitrokhin, but chief among them 
was undoubtedly the recurrent fear that the British agent 
network was deeply suspect. In February 1940 the Centre 
issued orders for all contact with Philby to be broken 
of£99 Contact with Burgess was terminated at about the 
same time.^^^ 

DURING THE LATER 1930s the hunt for “enemies of 
the people” replaced intelligence collection as the main 
priority of NKVD foreign operations. The NKVD’s most 
active foreign intelligence agency was Serebryansky’s 
Administration for Special Tasks, whose persecution of 
INO officers steadily diminished the flow of foreign 
intelligence and degraded its analysis at the Center. Even 



the executioners abroad, however, were not immune from 
the Terror at home. Serebryansky himself became one of 
the victims of his own witch-hunt. Though he held the 
Order of Lenin for his many victories over enemies of the 
people, he was recalled to Moscow in November 1938 
and exposed as “a spy of the British and French 
intelligence services.” An inquiry later concluded that his 
network contained “a large number of traitors and plain 
gangster elements.” Though the allegations of espionage 
for Britain and France were absurd, the charge that 
Serebryansky had inflated both the size of his illegal 
network and the scale of its accomplishments in reports to 
the Centre was probably well founded. 

Serebryansky’ s successor was Pavel Anatolyevich 
Sudoplatov, who a few months earlier had assassinated 
the emigre Ukrainian nationalist leader Yevkhen 
Konovalets with an ingeniously booby-trapped box of 
chocolates. In March 1939 Sudoplatov became deputy 
head of foreign intelligence, thus bringing “special tasks” 
and INO into closer association than ever before. He 
was personally instructed by Stalin that his chief task was 
to send a task force to Mexico to assassinate Leon 
Trotsky. The killing of Trotsky, codenamed operation 
UTKA (“Duck”), had become the chief objective of 
Stalin’s foreign policy. Even after the outbreak of the 
Second World War in September 1939, discovering the 
intentions of Adolf Hitler remained a lower priority than 
arranging the liquidation of the great heretic. 



Sudoplatov’s task force was composed of Spanish and 
Mexican NKVD agents recruited during the Civil War, 
supervised by his deputy, Leonid Eitingon, whose long 
experience of “special actions” included the liquidation of 
“enemies of the people” in Spain. 

The task force consisted of three groups. The first was 
an illegal network headed by the Spanish Communist 
Caridad Mercader del Rio (codenamed MOTHER), who 
was both recruited and seduced by Eitingon, one of the 
NKVD’s most celebrated womanizers. The most 
important agent in Caridad Mercader’ s group was her son 
Ramon (codenamed RAYMOND), who traveled on a 
doctored Canadian passport in the name of Frank Jacson 
(an eccentric NKVD spelling of Jackson). Like Eitingon, 
Ramon Mercader employed seduction as an operational 
technique, using his affair with the American Trotskyist 
Sylvia Ageloff to penetrate Trotsky’s villa near Mexico 
City. His opportunity came when Ageloff began work as 
one of Trotsky’s secretaries early in 1940. Each day 
Mercader drove her to Trotsky’s villa in the morning and 
returned to collect her after work. Gradually he became a 
well-known figure with the guards and some of Trotsky’s 
entourage, who, in March 1940, allowed him into the villa 
for the first time. Mercader’ s role at this stage was still 
that of penetration agent rather than assassin, with the task 
of reporting on the villa’s defenses, occupants and 
guards. 



The attack on the villa was to be led by a second group 
of agents drawn from veterans of the Spanish Civil War, 
headed by the celebrated Mexican Communist painter 
David Alfaro Siqueiros (codenamed KONE),^^^ who was 
animated by an exuberant ideological mix of art, 
revolution, Stalinism and exhibitionism. Both Mercader 
and Siqueiros were later to become well known for their 
involvement in operation UTKA. KGB files, however, 
also reveal the involvement of a shadowy third group of 
assassins headed by one of the most remarkable of all 
Soviet illegals, Iosif Romualdovich Grigulevich (then 
codenamed MAKS and FELIPE), who had taken a 
leading role in liquidating Trotskyists during the Spanish 
Civil War, as well as training saboteurs and arsonists to 
operate behind Franco’s lines. It is a measure of 
Grigulevich’ s skill in assuming false identities that, 
though bom a Lithuanian Jew,^^^ he was to succeed, a 
decade later, in passing himself off as a Costa Rican 
diplomat.^ Early in 1940 he recmited Siqueiros’s former 
pupil, the painter Antonio Pujol (codenamed JOSE), 
whom he later described as lacking in initiative but “very 
loyal, exceptionally reliable and quite bold,” to act as 
Siqueiros’s second-in-command in the assault on 
Trotsky’s villa.^^^ Grigulevich’s other recmits included 
his future wife and assistant, the Mexican Communist 
Laura Araujo Aguilar (codenamed LUISA). 

A key part of the assault plan was the infiltration in 



April 1940 of a young American agent, Robert Sheldon 
Harte (codenamed AMUR), posing as a New York 
Trotskyist, as a volunteer guard in Trotsky’s villa. Harte’s 
role was to open the main gate when the assault group 
staged its surprise attack in the middle of the night. 
Though enthusiastic, he was also naive. Grigulevich 
decided not to brief him on what would happen after he 
opened the villa gate. 

KGB records identify Grigulevich as the real leader of 
the assault on Trotsky’s villa.^^^ Grigulevich’s role in the 
attack was two-fold: to ensure that Siqueiros’s assault 
group gained entrance to the villa compound, and to try to 
inject some element of discipline into the attack. Left to 
his own devices, Siqueiros would have led the assault 
with all guns blazing but probably have made few 
attempts to cover his tracks. On the evening of May 23, 
1940 Siqueiros and a group of about twenty followers put 
on a mixture of army and police uniforms and armed 
themselves with pistols and revolvers. As they did so, 
according to one of their number, they “laughed and joked 
as if it were a feast day.”^^^ Then, with Pujol carrying the 
only machine-gun, Grigulevich and the assault group set 
off to assassinate Trotsky.^ 

On arriving at the villa in the early hours of May 24, 
Grigulevich spoke to the American volunteer guard, 
Harte, who opened the gate.^^^ The assault group raked 
the bedrooms with gun fire to such effect that the 



Mexican police later counted seventy-three bullet holes in 
Trotsky’s bedroom wall. Remarkably, however, Trotsky 
and his wife survived by throwing themselves beneath 
their bed. Though an incendiary bomb was thrown into 
the bedroom of their small grandson, he too escaped by 
hiding under his bed.^^^ Harte was shocked by the attack 
— ^particularly, perhaps, by the attempt to kill Trotsky’s 
grandchild. He angrily told the assault group that, had he 
known how they would behave, he would never have let 
them in. To prevent Harte revealing what had happened, 
he was taken away and shot.^^^ A few months later, 
Siqueiros was tracked down and arrested. Grigulevich, 
however, managed to smuggle himself, Pujol and Laura 
Araujo Aguilar out of the country without his identity 
being discovered by the Mexican police. From 1942 to 
1944 he ran an illegal residency in Argentina which, 
according to KGB files, planted more than 150 mines in 
cargoes and ships bound for Germany. 

The failure of the attack on Trotsky’s villa, followed by 
the dispersal of Siqueiros’s gunmen, led to the promotion 
of Ramon Mercader from penetration agent to assassin. 
Mercader succeeded partly because he was patient. Five 
days after the raid he met Trotsky for the first time. 
Amiable as ever, he gave Trotsky’s grandson a toy glider 
and taught him how to fly it. Over the next three months 
he paid ten visits to the villa, sometimes bringing small 
presents with him and always taking care not to overstay 



his welcome. Finally, on August 20, he brought an article 
he had written and asked for Trotsky’s advice. As Trotsky 
sat reading it at his study desk, Mercader took an icepick 
from his pocket and brought it down with all the force he 
could muster on the back of Trotsky’s skull. 

Mercader had expected Trotsky to die instantly and 
silently, thus allowing him to make his escape to a car 
nearby where his mother and her lover, Eitingon, were 
waiting. But Trotsky, though mortally wounded, let out “a 
terrible piercing cry.” (‘T shall hear that cry all my life,” 
said Mercader afterwards.) Mercader was arrested and 
later sentenced to twenty years in jail.^^^ Eitingon 
persuaded his mother to flee with him to Russia, 
promising to marry her if she did so. In Moscow Senora 
Mercader was welcomed by Beria, received by Stalin in 
the Kremlin and decorated with the Order of Lenin. But 
within a few years, abandoned by Eitingon and denied 
permission to leave Russia, she was consumed with guilt 
at having turned her son into an assassin and then leaving 
him to languish in a Mexican jail. 

Ramon Mercader kept the Stalinist faith throughout his 
twenty years in prison. History, he claimed, would see 
him as a soldier who had served the cause of the working- 
class revolution by ridding it of a traitor. KGB files reveal 
(contrary to most published accounts) that when Mercader 
was finally released and traveled to Moscow in 1960, he 
was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union, along 



with a general’s pension and a three-room apartment, and 
was personally congratulated by Khrushchev. Twenty 
years after the assassination of Trotsky, the liquidation of 
enemies of the people abroad still remained, on a reduced 
scale, a significant part of KGB foreign operations. 



SIX 


WAR 


During the later months of 1940, with Trotsky dead and 
the worst of the blood-letting inside INO at an end, the 
Centre sought to rebuild its foreign intelligence network. 
Until the Great Terror, all new recruits to INO had been 
trained individually at secret apartments in Moscow and 
kept strictly apart from other trainees. By 1938, however, 
so many INO officers had been unmasked as (imaginary) 
enemies of the people that the Centre decided group 
training was required to increase the flow of new recruits. 
NKVD order no. 00648 of October 3 set up the Soviet 
Union’s first foreign intelligence training school, hidden 
from public view in the middle of a wood at Balashikha, 
fifteen miles east of the Moscow ringroad. Given the 
official title Shkola Osobogo Naznacheniya (Special 
Purpose School), but better known by the acronym 
SHON, it drew its recruits either from Party and 
Komsomol members with higher education or from new 
university graduates in Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev and 
elsewhere.^ 

Since most of the new recruits had experienced only 



the cramped, squalid living conditions of crowded city 
apartment blocks, collective farms and army barracks, an 
attempt was made to introduce them to gracious living so 
that they would feel at ease in Western “high society.” 
Their rooms were furnished with what an official history 
solemnly describes as “rugs, comfortable and beautiful 
furniture, and tastefully chosen pictures on the walls, with 
excellent bed linens and expensive bedspreads.”^ With no 
experience of personal privacy, the trainees would have 
been disoriented by being accommodated separately even 
if space had allowed, and so were housed two to a room. 
The curriculum included four hours’ teaching a day on 
foreign languages, two hours on intelligence tradecraft, 
and lectures on the CPSU, history, diplomacy, 
philosophy, religion and painting — an eclectic mix 
designed both to reinforce their ideological orthodoxy and 
to acquaint them with Western bourgeois culture.^ There 
were also regular musical evenings. Instructors with 
experience living in the West gave the trainees crash 
courses in bourgeois manners, diplomatic etiquette, 
fashionable dressing and “good taste. During its first 
three years, SHON taught annual intakes totalling about 
120 trainees — all but four of them male.^ 

The most successful of SHON’s first intake of students 
was Pavel Mikhailovich Fitin, whose early career had 
been spent in an agricultural publishing house. In 
February 1938 he had been recruited by the NKVD’s 



internal training school to fill one of the many vacancies 
caused by the liquidation of “enemies of the people” 
within its ranks. In October he was transferred to SHON, 
where, according to an official hagiography, his “high 
intellect and outstanding organizational ability” made an 
immediate impression. After only a few months, with his 
training still incomplete, he was drafted into foreign 
intelligence. In May 1939 he was appointed head of INO. 
At age thirty-one, Fitin was both the youngest and most 
inexperienced foreign intelligence chief in Soviet history. 
At the time of his sudden promotion his prospects must 
have seemed poor. During the chaotic previous fifteen 
months three of his predecessors had been liquidated and 
a fourth transferred.^ Fitin, however, proved remarkably 
tenacious. He remained head of INO for seven years, the 
longest period anyone had held that office since the 
1920s, before losing favor and returning to provincial 
obscurity.^ 

Towards the end of 1940, four INO officers were 
despatched to London on Fitin’ s orders to reopen the legal 
residency. The new resident was Anatoli Veniaminovich 
Gorsky (codenamed VADIM), the last intelligence officer 
to be withdrawn from London before the residency had 
closed that February.^ Gorsky was a grimly efficient, 
humorless, orthodox Stalinist, a far cry from the Great 
Illegals of the mid- 1930s. Blunt found him “flat-footed” 
and unsympathetic.^ Another of his wartime agents 



described him as “a short, fattish man in his mid-thirties, 
with blond hair pushed straight back and glasses that 
failed to mask a pair of shrewd, cold eyes.”^^ Like Fitin, 
Gorsky owed his rapid promotion to the recent liquidation 
of most of his colleagues. 

Gorsky returned to London, however, far better briefed 
than during his previous tour of duty, when he had been 
forced to ask the Centre for background material on Kim 
Philby.^^ On Christmas Eve 1940 he reported that he had 
renewed contact with SOHNCHEN. The Centre appeared 
jubilant at Gorsky’s report. In the summer of 1940 
Burgess had succeeded in recruiting Philby to Section D 
of SIS, which soon afterwards was merged into a new 
organization, the Special Operations Executive (SOE), 
instructed by Churchill to “set Europe ablaze” through 
subversive warfare behind enemy lines. Following the 
six-week defeat of France and the Low Countries, the 
Prime Minister’s orders proved wildly optimistic. The 
Centre, however, warmly welcomed Gorsky’s report that 
Philby “was working as a political instructor at the 
training center of the British Intelligence Service 
preparing sabotage agents to be sent to Europe.” There 
was, however, one major surprise in Philby ’s early 
reports. “According to SOHNCHEN’ s date,” Gorsky 
informed the Centre, “[SOE] has not sent its agents to the 
USSR yet and is not even training them yet. The USSR is 
tenth on the list of countries to which agents are to be 
sent.” Wrongly convinced that the Soviet Union remained 



a priority target, a skeptical desk officer in the Centre 
underlined this passage and placed two large red question 
marks in the margin. 

Early in 1941, the London residency renewed contact 

with the other members of the Five. Maclean continued to 

provide large numbers of Foreign Office documents. 

Unlike Philby, Burgess had failed to secure a transfer 

from Section D of SIS to SOE and had returned to the 

BBC. Blunt, however, had succeeded in entering the 

Security Service, MI5, in the summer of 1940. As well as 

providing large amounts of material from MI5 files. Blunt 

also ran as a sub-agent one of his former Cambridge 

pupils, Leo Long (codenamed ELLI), who worked in 

military intelligence.^^ Among the early intelligence 

provided by Blunt from MI5 files was evidence that 

during the two years before the outbreak of the Second 

World War the NKVD had abandoned one of its best- 

placed British agents. In the summer of 1937, at the 

height of the paranoia generated by the Great Terror, the 

Centre had jumped to the absurd conclusion that Captain 

King, the Foreign Office cipher clerk recruited three years 

earlier, had been betrayed to British intelligence by 

Teodor Maly, the illegal resident in London. Blunt 

revealed that King had gone undetected until his 

identification by a Soviet defector at the outbreak of 
14 

war.^^ 

Caimcross too had succeeded in occupying what the 



Centre considered a prime position in Whitehall. In 
September 1940 he left the Treasury to become private 
secretary to one of Churchill’s ministers, Lord Hankey, 
Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. Though not a 
member of the War Cabinet (initially composed of only 
five senior ministers), Hankey received all cabinet papers, 
chaired many secret committees and was responsible for 
overseeing the work of the intelligence services. By the 
end of the year Caimcross was providing so many 
classified documents — among them War Cabinet minutes, 
SIS reports. Foreign Office telegrams and General Staff 
assessments — that Gorsky complained there was far too 
much to transmit in cipher. 

During 1941 London was easily the NKVD’s most 
productive legal residency. According to the Centre’s 
secret statistics, the residency forwarded to Moscow 
7,867 classified political and diplomatic documents, 715 
on military matters, 127 on economic affairs and 51 on 
British intelligence.^^ In addition it provided many other 
reports based on verbal information from the Five and 
other agents. It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that, 
until the Soviet Union entered the war, most of this 
treasure trove of high-grade intelligence was simply 
wasted. Stalin’s understanding of British policy was so 
distorted by conspiracy theory that no amount of good 
intelligence was likely to enlighten him. Despite the fact 
that Britain and Germany were at war, he continued to 



believe — as he had done since the mid- 193 Os — that the 
British were plotting to embroil him with Hitler. His 
belief in a non-existent British conspiracy helped to blind 
him to the existence of a real German plot to invade the 
Soviet Union. 

THE LEGAL RESIDENCY in the Berlin embassy 
resumed work in 1940 at about the same time as that in 
London. The NKVD had lost touch with its most 
important German agent, Arvid Hamack (codenamed 
CORSICAN), an official in the Economics Ministry, in 
June 1938. Early on the morning of September 17,1940 
contact was resumed by the newly arrived deputy Berlin 
resident, Aleksandr Mikhailovich Korotkov (alias 
“Erdberg,” codenamed SASHA and DLINNY). The fact 
that Korotkov simply knocked on Hamack’ s door and 
arranged their next meeting in the Soviet embassy is 
evidence both of the decline in tradecraft caused by the 
liquidation of most experienced INO officers and of the 
fact that the Gestapo was at this stage of the war far less 
omnipresent than was widely supposed. 

A fellow member of the German Communist 
underground. Reinhold Schonbmnn, later recalled: 

Hamack ... had little sense of humor, and we, his 
colleagues, did not feel at ease in his presence. There 
was something of the puritan in the man, something 
narrow and doctrinaire. But he was extremely 



devoted. 


Like Burgess and Philby, Hamack was so highly 
motivated that he had carried on recruiting intelligence 
sources even during the two and a quarter years that he 
was out of contact with the Centre. Korotkov reported that 
Hamack was in touch with a loose network of about sixty 
people, although he could not “personally vouch for every 
person”: 

CORSICAN’S description of the way that they 
camouflage their operations is that, while not all of 
the members of the circle know one another, 
something of a chain exists. CORSICAN himself 
tries to remain in the background although he is at 
the heart of the organization.^^ 

The most important of the sources cultivated by 
Hamack was a lieutenant in the Luftwaffe intelligence 
service, Harro Schulze-Boysen, codenamed STARSHINA 
(“Senior”), whose dynamic personality provided a 
striking contrast with that of the dour Hamack. Leopold 
Trepper, who knew them both, found Schulze-Boysen “as 
passionate and hot-headed as Arvid Hamack was calm 
and reflective.” His tall, athletic frame, fair hair, blue eyes 
and Aryan features were far removed from the Gestapo 
stereotype of the Communist subversive. On March 15, 
1941 the Centre ordered Korotkov to make direct contact 



with Schulze-Boysen and persuade him to form his own 
network of informants independent of Hamack. Schulze- 
Boysen needed little persuasion. 

Even a more experienced intelligence officer than 
Korotkov would have found Hamack, Schulze-Boysen 
and their groups of agents difficult to mn. Both networks 
put themselves at increased risk by combining covert 
opposition to the Nazi regime with espionage for the 
Soviet Union. Schulze-Boysen and his glamorous wife, 
Libertas, held evening discussion groups for members of, 
and potential recmits to, an anti-Hitler underground. 
Libertas ’s many lovers added to the danger of discovery. 
As young resisters pasted anti-Nazi posters on Berlin 
walls, Schulze-Boysen stood guard over them dressed in 
his Luftwaffe uniform, with his pistol at the ready and the 
safety catch off.^^ 

The most important intelligence provided by the 
Hamack and Schulze-Boysen networks in the first half of 
1941 concerned Hitler’s preparations for operation 
BARBAROSSA, the invasion of Russia. On June 16 
Korotkov cabled the Centre that intelligence from the two 
networks indicated that “[a] 11 of the military training by 
Germany in preparation for its attack on the Soviet Union 
is complete, and the strike may be expected at any 
time.”^^ Similar intelligence arrived from NKVD sources 
as far afield as China and Japan. Later KGB historians 
counted “over a hundred” intelligence warnings of 



preparations for the German attack forwarded to Stalin by 
Fitin between January 1 and June 21 ?^ Others came from 
military intelligence. All were wasted. Stalin was as 
resistant to good intelligence from Germany as he was to 
good intelligence from Britain. 

The Great Terror had institutionalized the paranoid 
strain in Soviet intelligence assessment. Many NKVD 
officers shared, if usually to a less grotesque degree, 
Stalin’s addiction to conspiracy theory. None the less, the 
main blame for the catastrophic failure to foresee the 
surprise attack on June 22 belongs to Stalin himself, who 
continued to act as his own chief intelligence analyst. 
Stalin did not merely ignore a series of wholly accurate 
warnings. He denounced many of those who provided 
them. His response to an NKVD report from Schulze- 
Boysen on June 16 was the obscene minute: “You can 
send your ‘source’ from the German air force to his whore 
of a mother! This is not a ‘source’ but a disinformer. J. 
Stalin. Stalin also heaped abuse on the great GRU 
illegal Richard Sorge, who sent similar warnings from 
Tokyo, where he had penetrated the German embassy and 
seduced the ambassador’s wife. Sorge ’s warnings of 
operation BARBAROSSA were dismissed by Stalin as 
disinformation from a lying “shit who has set himself up 
with some small factories and brothels in Japan.”^^ 

Stalin was much less suspicious of Adolf Hitler than of 
Winston Churchill, the evil genius who had preached an 



anti-Bolshevik crusade in the civil war twenty years 
earlier and had been plotting against the Soviet Union 
ever since. Behind many of the reports of impending 
German attack Stalin claimed to detect a disinformation 
campaign by Churchill designed to continue the long- 
standing British plot to embroil him with Hitler. 
Churchill’s personal warnings to Stalin of preparations for 
BARBAROSSA only heightened his suspicions. From the 
intelligence reports sent by the London residency, Stalin 
almost certainly knew that until June 1941 the Joint 
Intelligence Committee ( JIC), the body responsible for 
the main British intelligence assessments, did not believe 
that Hitler was preparing an invasion. It reported to 
Churchill as late as May 23 that “the advantages ... to 
Germany of concluding an agreement with the USSR are 
overwhelming.”^^ The JIC assessments were probably 
regarded by Stalin as further proof that Churchill’s 
warnings were intended to deceive him. Stalin’s deep 
suspicions of Churchill and of British policy in general 
were cleverly exploited by the Germans. As part of the 
deception operation which preceded BARBAROSSA, the 
Abwehr, German military intelligence, spread reports that 
rumors of an impending German attack were part of a 
British disinformation campaign. 

By early June, reports of German troop movements 
toward the Soviet frontier were too numerous to be 
explained, even by Stalin, simply as British 
disinformation. At a private lunch in the German embassy 



in Moscow, the ambassador, Count von der Schulenberg, 
revealed that Hitler had definitely decided on invasion. 
“You will ask me why I am doing this,” he said to the 
astonished Soviet ambassador to Germany, Vladimir 
Georgyevich Dekanozov. “I was raised in the spirit of 
Bismarck, who was always an opponent of war with 
Russia.” Stalin’s response was to tell the Politburo, 
“Disinformation has now reached ambassadorial level 
On June 9, or soon afterwards, however, Stalin received a 
report that the German embassy had been sent orders by 
telegram to prepare for evacuation within a week and had 
begun burning documents in the basement.^^ 

Though Stalin remained preoccupied by a non-existent 
British conspiracy, he increasingly began to suspect a 
German plot as well — though not one which aimed at 
surprise attack. As it became ever more difficult to 
conceal German troop movements, the Abwehr spread 
rumors that Hitler was preparing to issue an ultimatum, 
backed by some display of military might, demanding 
new concessions from the Soviet Union. It was this 
illusory threat of an ultimatum, rather than the real threat 
of German invasion, which increasingly worried Stalin 
during the few weeks and days before BARBAROSSA. 
He was not alone. A succession of foreign statesmen and 
journalists were also taken in by the planted rumors of a 
German ultimatum.^^ 

Beria sought to protect his position as head of the 



NKVD by expressing mounting indignation at those 
inside and outside the NKVD who dared to send reports 
of preparations for a German invasion. On June 21, 1941 
he ordered four NKVD officers who persisted in sending 
such reports to be “ground into labor camp dust.” He 
wrote to Stalin on the same day with his characteristic 
mix of brutality and sycophancy: 

I again insist on recalling and punishing our 
ambassador to Berlin, Dekanozov, who keeps 
bombarding me with “reports” on Hitler’s alleged 
preparations to attack the USSR. He has reported 
that this attack will start tomorrow ... But I and my 
people, Iosif Vissarionovich, have firmly embedded 
in our memory your wise conclusion: Hitler is not 
going to attack us in 1941.^^ 

Also in jeopardy for providing intelligence on the 
forthcoming German invasion was the senior INO officer 
Vasili Mikhailovich Zarubin, later chief resident in the 
United States. Early in 1941 Zarubin was sent to China 
to meet Walter Stennes, German adviser to the Chinese 
nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek. Stennes had once 
been deputy head of Hitler’s stormtroopers, the 
Sturmabteilung, but developed a grudge against him after 
being sacked in 1931. In 1939 Stennes was approached by 
the NKVD Chungking residency and agreed to supply 
intelligence on Hitler. In February 1941 Zarubin reported 



to the Centre that a visitor from Berlin had secretly 
assured Stennes that “an attack against the USSR by the 
Germans ... was being planned for the end of May this 
year” (the original date set by Hitler but later postponed). 

Zarubin cabled on June 20: “The FRIEND [Stennes] 
repeats and confirms categorically — ^based on absolutely 
reliable information — that Hitler has completed 
preparations for war against the USSR.”^^ Fitin outraged 
Beria by taking these and similar warnings seriously. An 
SVR official history concludes, probably correctly, “Only 
the outbreak of war saved P. M. Fitin from the firing 
squad.”^^ 

The devastating surprise achieved by the German 
invasion in the early hours of June 22 was made possible 
both by the nature of the Soviet intelligence system at the 
time and by the personal failings of the dictator who 
presided over it. In Whitehall the patient, if uninspired, 
examination of intelligence reports through the committee 
system eventually turned the belief that Germany saw the 
“overwhelming” advantages of a negotiated settlement 
with Russia into recognition that Hitler had decided to 
attack. In Moscow the whole system of intelligence 
assessment was dominated by the fearful sycophancy 
encapsulated in the formula “sniff out, suck up, survive,” 
and by a culture of conspiracy theory. 

Stalin had institutionalized both a paranoid strain and a 
servile political correctness which continued to distort in 



greater or lesser degree all intelligence assessment even 
after the outbreak of the Great Patriotic War in 1941. 
From 1942 to 1944 the Cambridge Five, probably the 
ablest group of Soviet wartime agents, were to be 
seriously suspected by the Centre of being double agents 
controlled by British intelligence simply because their 
voluminous and highly classified intelligence sometimes 
failed to conform to Stalin’s conspiracy theories. The 
responsibility, however, did not rest with Stalin alone. 
Some degree of distortion in intelligence assessment 
remained inherent in the autocratic nature of the Soviet 
system throughout the Cold War. The Centre always 
shrank from telling the Kremlin what it did not want to 
hear. The last head of KGB foreign intelligence, Leonid 
Shebarshin, confessed in 1992 that until Gorbachev 
introduced a measure of glasnost, the KGB “had to 
present its reports in a falsely positive light” which 
pandered to the predilections of the political leadership.^^ 

IN THE EARLY months of the Great Patriotic War, while 
the German forces advancing into Russia were sweeping 
all before them, Stalin faced the even more terrifying 
prospect of a two-front war. Ribbentrop instructed the 
German embassy in Japan, “Do everything to rouse the 
Japanese to begin war against Russia ... Our goal remains 
to shake hands with the Japanese on the Trans-Siberian 
Railway before the beginning of winter.” Opinion in 
Tokyo was initially divided between those who favored 



the “northern solution” (war with the Soviet Union) and 
the supporters of the “southern solution” (war with Britain 
and the United States). Sorge, deeply distrusted by Stalin, 
sought to provide reassurance from Tokyo that the 
advocates of the “southern solution” were gaining the 
upper hand. But on October 18 Sorge was arrested and his 
spy ring rapidly rounded up. 

SIGINT was more influential than Sorge in persuading 
Stalin that there would be no Japanese attack. Late in 
1938 the combined NKVD/Fourth Department SIGINT 
unit had been broken up. The NKVD section moved into 
the former Hotel Select on Dzerzhinsky Street, where it 
concentrated on diplomatic traffic; most, but not all, 
military communications were the responsibility of the 
cryptanalysts of the GRU (successor to the Fourth 
Department). In February 1941 the NKVD cryptanalysts 
had been integrated into a new and enlarged Fifth 
(Cipher) Directorate, with, at its heart, a research section 
responsible for the attack on foreign codes and ciphers. 
The chief Japanese specialist in the section, Sergei 
Tolstoy, went on to become the most decorated Soviet 
cryptanalyst of the war, winning two Orders of Lenin. In 
the autumn of 1941, a group led by him replicated the 
success of American codebreakers a year earlier in 
breaking the main Japanese diplomatic cipher, codenamed 
by the Americans and since known to Western historians 
as PURPLE. The teetotal American codebreakers had 
celebrated their success by sending out for a case of Coca- 



Cola. Tolstoy is unlikely to have had time to celebrate at 
all. The Japanese diplomatic decrypts which he provided, 
however, were of enormous importance. Japan, they made 
clear, would not attack the Soviet Union.^^ 

The reassurance about Japanese intentions provided by 
SIGINT enabled Stalin to shift to the west half the 
divisional strength of the Far Eastern Command. During 
October and November 1941, between eight and ten rifle 
divisions, together with about a thousand tanks and a 
thousand aircraft, were flung into the fight against 
Germany. These forces, together with other Red Army 
divisions which had been held in reserve, may well have 
saved the Soviet Union from defeat. As Professor Richard 
Overy concludes in his study of the eastern front, “It was 
not the tough winter conditions that halted the German 
army [in December 1941] but the remarkable revival of 
Soviet military manpower after the terrible maulings of 
the summer and autumn.”^^ 

As well as providing reassurance that Japan did not 
propose to attack the Soviet Union, SIGINT also gave 
indications of its move towards war with Britain and the 
United States, though the diplomatic decrypts contained 
no mention of plans for a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. 
A decrypted telegram from Tokyo to its Berlin embassy 
(probably copied to the Moscow embassy) on November 
27, 1941, ten days before Pearl Harbor, instructed the 
ambassador: 



See Hitler and Ribbentrop, and explain to them in 
secret our relations with the United States ... Explain 
to Hitler that the main Japanese efforts will be 
concentrated in the south and that we propose to 
refrain from deliberate operations in the north 
[against the Soviet Union]. 

Soviet cryptanalysts, however, were unable to match 
the success of the British wartime SIGINT agency at 
Bletchley Park in breaking the main high-grade ciphers 
used by the German armed forces. They failed to do so 
partly for technological reasons. Soviet intelligence was 
unable to construct the powerful electronic “bombs,” first 
constructed at Bletchley Park in 1940 to break the daily 
settings of the German Enigma machine cipher. It was 
even further from being able to replicate COLOSSUS, the 
world’s first electronic computer used by Bletchley from 
1943 to decrypt the Geheimschreiber messages (radio 
signals based on teleprinter impulses enciphered and 
deciphered automatically) which for the last two years of 
the war yielded more operational intelligence than the 
Enigma traffic. But there was a human as well as a 
technological explanation for the inferiority of Soviet to 
British SIGINT. The Soviet system would never have 
tolerated the remarkable infusion of unconventional 
youthful talent on which much of Bletchley’s success was 
built. Alan Turing — the brilliant eccentric who buried his 
life savings (converted into silver ingots) in the Bletchley 



Woods, forgot where he had hidden them, but went on to 
be chiefly responsible for the invention of COLOSSUS — 
was one of many British cryptanalysts who would surely 
have been incapable of conforming to the political 
correctness demanded by the Stalinist system.^^ Some 
British ULTRA — the SIGINT derived from decrypting 
high-grade enemy traffic — ^was, however, passed 
officially to Moscow in a disguised form, and in an 
undisguised form by several Soviet agents. 

JUST AS THE KGB later sought to take refuge from the 
horrors of its Stalinist past by constructing a Leninist 
golden age of revolutionary purity, so it also sought to 
reinvent its record during the Great Patriotic War of 1941- 
5 as one of selfless heroism — ^best exemplified by its role 
in special operations and partisan warfare behind enemy 
lines. According to Pavel Anatoly evich Sudoplatov, head 
of the wartime NKVD Directorate for Special Tasks and 
Guerrilla Warfare, “This chapter in NKVD history is the 
only one that was not officially rewritten, since its 
accomplishments stood on their own merit and did not 
contain Stalinist crimes that had to be covered up.”^^ In 
reality, the NKVD’s wartime record, like the rest of its 
history, was extensively doctored. 

Among the best-publicized examples of the NKVD’s 
bravery behind enemy lines were the heroic deeds of its 
detachment in the Ukrainian Black Sea port of Odessa 



during the 907-day occupation by German and Romanian 
forces. The detachment based itself in the catacombs 
there, a maze of underground tunnels used to excavate 
sandstone for the construction of the elegant nineteenth- 
century buildings which still line many of Odessa’s streets 
and boulevards. With over a thousand kilometers of 
unmapped tunnels as well as numerous entrances and 
exits, the catacombs made an almost ideal base for 
partisan warfare. In 1969, on the twenty-fifth anniversary 
of VE Day, a section of the catacombs on the outskirts of 
Odessa was opened as the Museum of Partisan Glory, 
which throughout the remainder of the Soviet era received 
over a million visitors a year.^^ 

After the Second World War, however, the sometimes 
heroic story of the struggle to liberate Odessa from enemy 
occupation was hijacked by the KGB to refurbish its 
dubious wartime record. Pride of place in the Museum of 
Partisan Glory is given to the exploits of the NKVD 
detachment headed by Captain Vladimir Aleksandrovich 
Molodtsov, who was posthumously made a Hero of the 
Soviet Union and suffered the indignity of having his 
whole life transformed into that of a Stalinist plaster saint. 
The origins of Molodtsov’s heroism were officially traced 
back to selfless devotion in overfulfilling his norms as a 
miner during the first Five Year Plan. “What a wonderful 
thing it is,” he was said to have declared in 1930, “not to 
notice or watch the time during the working day, not to 
wait for the end of the shift but to seek to prolong it, to 



run behind the [coal] trolley, to be bathed in sweat and at 
the end of the shift to emerge victorious in fulfilling the 
plan!”^^ 

The Museum of Partisan Glory contains a 
“reconstruction” of the NKVD detachment’s underground 
headquarters, complete with dormitories, ammunition 
depot, workshops, fuel store, kitchen and meeting room 
with — inevitably — a portrait of Lenin (but not of Stalin) 
on the wall.^^ Nearby is a vertical shaft 17 meters long 
linking the headquarters to the surface, through which it 
received messages and food from its agents in Odessa. 
During the Soviet era numerous films, books, magazine 
and newspaper articles, many promoted by the KGB, 
celebrated the heroic feats of the NKVD detachment in 
holding at bay thousands of German and Romanian troops 
in Odessa before giving their lives in defense of the 
fatherland. 

Mitrokhin owed his discovery of the true story of the 
catacombs to a colleague in the FCD Illegals Directorate 
S, who borrowed the multi- volume Odessa file and, when 
he returned it, told Mitrokhin he might find it interesting. 
The file began by recording the despatch of Molodtsov’s 
detachment of six NKVD officers to Odessa shortly 
before it fell to the Germans in October 1941, with orders 
to establish an underground residency which would 
organize reconnaissance, sabotage and special operations 
behind the German lines. In Odessa they were joined by 
thirteen members of the local NKVD Special Department, 



commanded by Lieutenant V. A. Kuznetsov. According to 
the official version of events, the two groups held a 
Party/Komsomol meeting on the evening of October 15 
immediately before going down into the catacombs to set 
up their base. What actually took place, according to the 
KGB file, was a raucous dinner party and heavy drinking 
which ended in a fight between the Moscow and Odessa 
NKVD detachments. The next day the two groups entered 
the catacombs still at daggers drawn, with Molodtsov and 
Kuznetsov each claiming overall command. Over the next 
nine months Muscovites and Odes sans combined 
operations against the Germans and Romanians with 
internecine warfare among themselves. 

Molodtsov’ s end may well have been genuinely heroic. 
According to the official Soviet version, he was captured 
by the enemy in July 1942 but refused to beg for his life, 
courageously telling his captors, “We are in our own 
country and will not ask the enemy for mercy.”^^ The rest 
of the history of the Odessa catacombs, however, was an 
NKVD horror story. After Molodtsov’ s execution, 
Kuznetsov disarmed his detachment and put them under 
guard inside the catacombs. All but one, N. F. Abramov, 
were executed on Kuznetsov’s orders on charges of 
plotting against him. As conditions in the catacombs 
deteriorated, the Odessans then proceeded to fall out 
among themselves. The dwindling food supply became 
moldy; and, with their kerosene almost exhausted, the 
detachment was forced to live in semidarkness. On 



August 28 Kuznetsov shot one of his men, Molochny, for 
the theft of a piece of bread. On September 27 two others, 
Polschikov and Kovalchuk, were executed for stealing 
food and “lack of sexual discipline.” Fearing that he 
might be shot next, Abramov killed Kuznetsov a month 
later. In his notebook, later discovered in the catacombs 
and preserved in the KGB Odessa file, Abramov wrote: 

The former head of the Third Special Department of 
the Odessa district of the NKVD, State Security 
Lieutenant V. A. Kuznetsov, was shot by me with 
two bullets in the temple in the underground “Mirror 
Factory” [the base in the catacombs] on October 21, 
1942. 

By this time, following several other deaths at the hands 
of the enemy, only three NKVD officers remained alive in 
the catacombs: Abramov, Glushchenko and Litvinov. 
Abramov and Glushchenko together killed Litvinov, then 
began to eye each other suspiciously in the semi-darkness. 

Glushchenko wrote in his diary that Abramov wanted 
to surrender: “We are beaten. There is no victory to wait 
for. He told me not to be frightened of committing treason 
or being shot as he has friends in German intelligence.” 
On February 18, 1943, apparently suffering from 

hallucinations, Glushchenko wrote, “[Abramov] was 
bending over, attending to his papers. I took my pistol 
from my belt and shot him in the back of the head.” Over 



the next few months Glushchenko spent much of his time 
outside the catacombs in his wife’s Odessa flat, finally 
abandoning the underground base on November 10, 1943. 
After the liberation of Odessa by the Red Army in April 
1945 Glushchenko returned with members of the 
Ukrainian NKVD to collect equipment and compromising 
papers from the catacombs, but was fatally wounded 
when a grenade he picked up exploded in his hands. 

For almost twenty years, the Centre believed that no 
survivor of the Odessa catacombs remained to cast doubt 
on the heroic myth it had constructed. In 1963, however, 
the KGB was disconcerted to discover that Abramov had 
not been killed by Glushchenko after all, but had escaped 
and was living in France. His father, who may also have 
known the true story of the Odessa catacombs, was 
reported to have emigrated to the United States. 
Abramov’s supposed widow, Nina Abramova, who had 
been working in the KGB First Chief Directorate, was 
quietly transferred to another job. The myth of the NKVD 
heroes of the Odessa catacombs was left undisturbed.^^ 

According to statistics in KGB files, the NKVD ran a 
total of 2,222 “operational combat groups” behind enemy 
lines during the Great Patriotic War.^^ Mitrokhin found 
no realistic appraisal, however, of the effectiveness of 
partisan warfare. Contrary to the claims of post-war 
Soviet hagiographers, the combat groups seem only rarely 
to have tied down German forces larger than 



themselves. Because about half of all partisans were 
NKVD personnel or Party officials, they were frequently 
regarded with acute suspicion by the peasant population 
on whom they depended for local support. The virtual 
collapse of partisan warfare in the western Ukraine, for 
example, was due largely to the hostility of the inhabitants 
to the Party and the NKVD. Though partisan warfare 
became more effective after Stalingrad, there were 
important areas — notably Crimea and the steppes — where 
it never became a significant factor in the fighting on the 
eastern front. 

OUTSIDE EUROPE, THE NKVD’s most successful 
attacks on German targets were mounted by an illegal 
residency in Argentina,^^ headed by Iosif Romualdovich 
Grigulevich (codenamed ARTUR), a veteran both of 
sabotage operations in the Spanish Civil War and of the 
first attempt to assassinate Trotsky in Mexico City.^^ In 
September 1941 an official Argentinian inquiry reached 
the hysterical conclusion, endorsed by the Chamber of 
Deputies but rejected by the government, that the German 
ambassador was the head of over half a million Nazi 
stormtroopers operating under cover in Latin America. 
During the months after Pearl Harbor, Argentina and 
Chile were the only Latin American states not to break off 
diplomatic relations with Germany and Japan. The rumors 
of Nazi plots among Argentina’s quarter of a million 



German speakers, pro-German sympathies in its officer 
corps, and the presence of an Argentinian military 
purchasing mission in Berlin until 1944, helped to 
persuade the Centre that Argentina was a major Nazi 
base. Though this belief was greatly exaggerated, it was 
shared by OSS, the US wartime foreign intelligence 
agency, which reported that Dr. Ramon Castillo, president 
of Argentina from 1941 to 1943, was in the pay of 
Hitler.^^ Such reports, passed on to the Centre by its 
agents in OSS and the State Department,^^ doubtless 
reinforced Moscow’s suspicions of Nazi plots in 
Argentina. 

After the outbreak of war the German merchant navy 
was unable to run the gauntlet of the Royal Navy and 
enter Argentinian ports. Grigulevich’s residency, 
however, reported in 1941 that copper, saltpetre, cotton 
and other strategic raw materials were being exported 
from Argentina in neutral vessels to Spain, whence they 
were being secretly transported overland through France 
to Germany. To disrupt this export trade, Grigulevich 
recruited a sabotage team of eight Communist dockyard 
workers and seamen, headed by a Polish immigrant, 
Feliks Klementyevich Verzhbitsky (codenamed 
BESSER), who in December 1941 obtained a job as a 
blacksmith in the port of Buenos Aires. The first major 
exploit of Verzhbitsky’s group was to bum down the 
German bookshop in Buenos Aires, which Grigulevich 
regarded as the main center of Nazi propaganda. 



Thereafter it concentrated on planting delayed-action 
incendiary devices on ships and in warehouses containing 
goods bound for Germany. Grigulevich also ran smaller 
sabotage and intelligence networks in Chile and Uruguay. 
The approximately seventy agents in his far-flung illegal 
residency were to remain the basis of Soviet intelligence 
operations in Argentina, Uruguay and — to a lesser extent 
— Chile during the early years of the Cold War as well as 
the Second World War.^^ 

Between the beginning of 1942 and the summer of 
1944, according to statistics in KGB files, over 150 
successful incendiary attacks were mounted by 
Grigulevich’ s agents against German cargoes, and an 
unspecified number of Spanish, Portuguese and Swedish 
vessels sunk. One, probably exaggerated, assessment by 
the Centre claims that the attacks succeeded early in 1944 
in halting German exports from Buenos Aires. A more 
serious problem for Germany than Soviet sabotage, 
however, was the change of government in Argentina. A 
military coup in the summer of 1943, followed by the 
uncovering of a Nazi espionage network, led Argentina to 
sever diplomatic relations with Germany in January 

1944,60 

For most of the war communications between 
Grigulevich’ s residency and the Centre were slow and 
spasmodic, depending on occasional couriers between 
Buenos Aires and the New York residency. In the 



summer of 1944, shortly after the NKGB had established 
a legal residency in Uruguay, Grigulevich was summoned 
to Montevideo to give a detailed report on his intelligence 
operations, finances and agent networks since the 
beginning of the Great Patriotic War. The Centre had 
become alarmed at the scale of his incendiary attacks on 
neutral shipping and feared that his cover might be blown. 
In September it ordered him to suspend sabotage 
operations and limit himself to intelligence collection in 
Argentina, Brazil and Chile. Once instructed to stop 
work by Grigulevich, Verzhbitsky began making 
grenades for the underground Argentinian Communist 
Party but was seriously injured in October by an 
explosion in his workshop which cost him his left arm and 
the sight in one eye. Grigulevich reported that he behaved 
with great bravery during police investigation, sticking to 
a prepared cover story that a personal enemy had planted 
explosives on him, hidden in a packet of dried milk. In 
1945 Verzhbitsky was smuggled out of prison and 
exfiltrated by the Argentinian Communist Party across the 
border into Uruguay, where he lived on a Party pension. 

Remarkable though they were, the sabotage operations 
run from Buenos Aires had no perceptible influence on 
the course of the Great Patriotic War. Once the alarmism 
of the summer of 1944 had died down, however, they 
greatly enhanced Grigulevich’ s reputation in the Centre as 
saboteur and assassin. His successes in wartime Argentina 
help to explain his later selection for the most important 



assassination mission of the Cold War.^^ By contrast, 
Grigulevich’s chief saboteur, Verzhbitsky, was regarded 
as an embarrassment because of his disablement. His 
request to emigrate to the Soviet Union in 1946 was 
brusquely turned down. In 1955, however, when 
Verzhbitsky, by then completely blind, applied again, his 
application was accepted — possibly for fear that he might 
otherwise reveal his wartime role.^^ On arrival in the 
Soviet Union, Verzhbitsky was awarded an invalidity 
pension of 100 roubles a month, but his application for 
membership of the Soviet Communist Party was turned 
down.^^ 

DESPITE INDIVIDUAL ACTS of heroism, the NKVD 
and NKGB (as its security and intelligence components 
were renamed in 1943) deserve to be remembered less for 
their bravery during the Second World War than for their 
brutality. After the forcible incorporation into the Soviet 
Union of eastern Poland in September 1939, followed by 
the Baltic states and Moldavia in the summer of 1940, the 
NKVD quickly moved in to liquidate “class enemies” and 
cow the populations into submission. On June 25, 1941, 
three days after the beginning of Hitler’s invasion, the 
NKVD was ordered to secure the rear of the Red Army by 
arresting deserters and enemy agents, protecting 
communications and liquidating isolated pockets of 
German troops. In August 1941 Soviet parachutists 



disguised as Germans landed among the villages of the 
Volga German Autonomous Region and asked to be 
hidden until the arrival of the Wehrmacht. When they 
were given shelter, the whole village was exterminated by 
the NKVD. All other Volga Germans, however loyal, 
were deported by the NKVD to Siberia and northern 
Kazakhstan, with enormous loss of life. 

When the Red Army took the offensive in 1943, the 
NKVD followed in its wake to mop up resistance and 
subversion. Beria reported proudly to Stalin at the end of 
the year: 

In 1943, the troops of the NKVD, who are 
responsible for security in the rear of the Active Red 
Army, in the process of cleaning up the territory 
liberated from the enemy, arrested 931,549 people 
for investigation. Of these, 582,515 were servicemen 
and 394,034 were civilians. 

Of those arrested, 80,296 were “unmasked,” in many 
cases wrongly, as spies, traitors, deserters, bandits and 
“criminal elements.” 

Stalin used the NKVD to punish and deport entire 
nations within the Soviet Union whom he accused of 
treachery: among them Chechens, Ingushi, Balkars, 
Karachai, Crimean Tartars, Kalmyks and Meskhetian 
Turks. In response to Stalin’s instructions to reward 
“those who have carried out the deportation order in an 



exemplary manner,” Beria replied: 


In accordance with your instructions, I submit a draft 
decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the 
USSR on decorations and medals for the most 
outstanding participants in the operation involving 
the deportation of the Chechens and Ingushes. 

19,000 members of the NKVD, NKGB and Smersh 
took part, plus up to 100,000 officers of the NKVD 
forces ... 

As on this occasion, many of the NKVD and NKGB 
personnel decorated during the war received their medals 
not for valor against the enemy but for crimes against 
humanity. 

THE WARTIME RECORD of Soviet intelligence on the 
eastern front was patchy. Up to the end of 1942 the main 
espionage system providing intelligence from Nazi 
Germany and occupied Europe was a loosely coordinated 
GRU illegal network linked to the NKVD Hamack and 
Schulze-Boysen groups, codenamed the Rote Kappelle 
(“Red Orchestra”) by the Abwehr. The “musicians” were 
the radio operators who sent coded messages to Moscow; 
the “conductor” was the Polish Jew Leopold Trepper, 
alias Jean Gilbert, known within the network as le grand 
chef. The Rote Kappelle had 117 agents: 48 in Germany, 
35 in France, 17 in Belgium and 17 in Switzerland.^^ The 



network was gradually wound up during the later months 
of 1942 as German radio direction- finding tracked down 
the “musicians.” Trepper himself was captured as he sat 
in a dentist’s chair in occupied Paris on December 5. 
According to the Abwehr officer who arrested him, “For a 
second he was disturbed; then he said in perfect German, 
‘You did a fine job.’ ” Only Rado’s GRU illegal 
residency in Switzerland, known as the Rote Drei after its 
three main radio transmitters, which was out of reach of 
German intelligence, continued work for another year 
until it was shut down by the Swiss.^^ 

Though both Trepper and Rado were sentenced to ten 
years’ imprisonment in Moscow after the war, it was later 
alleged by Soviet historians that intelligence from the 
Rote Kappelle had been of enormous assistance to the 
Red Army. In reality, intelligence did not begin to have a 
significant influence on Soviet military operations until 
after Trepper was arrested and most of his network wound 
up. Military intelligence failed to detect the sudden 
German turn south which captured Kiev in September 
1941, and was taken aback by the intensity of the October 
assault on Moscow. The loss of Kharkov in May 1942 
was due partly to the fact that the Stavka (a wartime 
combination of GHQ and high command) was expecting 
another attack on the capital. The Wehrmachfs move 
south in the summer again took the Stavka by surprise. 
Throughout the German advance to Stalingrad and the 
Caucasus, Soviet forces were constantly confused about 



where the next blow would fall. When the Red Army 
encircled Axis forces at Stalingrad in November 1942, it 
believed it had trapped 85,000 to 90,000 troops; in reality 
it had surrounded three times as many.^^ 

The NKVD’s main role at Stalingrad was less in 
providing good intelligence than in enforcing a ferocious 
discipline within the Red Army. About 13,500 Soviet 
soldiers were executed for “defeatism” and other breaches 
of military discipline in the course of the battle, usually 
by a squad from the NKVD Special Detachment. Before 
execution, most were ordered to strip so that their uniform 
and boots could be reused. The NKVD postal censorship 
seized on any unorthodox or politically incorrect 
comment in soldiers’ letters to their families as evidence 
of treachery. A lieutenant who wrote “German aircraft are 
very good ... Our anti-aircraft people shoot down only 
very few of them” was, inevitably, condemned as a 
traitor. In the 62nd Army alone, in the first half of 
October 1942, the NKVD claimed that “military secrets 
were divulged in 12,747 letters. The great victory at 
Stalingrad, sealed by the surrender of the German Field 
Marshal Friedrich Paulus, twenty- two generals and 
91,000 troops early in 1943, was achieved in spite of, 
rather than because of, the contribution of the NKVD. 

Stalingrad was followed by a major improvement in the 
quality of Soviet military intelligence on the eastern front, 
made possible in part by massive supplies of radio 



equipment from the Americans and the BritishJ^ At the 
end of 1942 the Stavka established special-purpose radio 
battalions, each equipped with eighteen to twenty radio- 
intercept receivers and four direction- finding sets. The 
result, according to a Soviet historian given access to the 
battalions’ records, was “a qualitative jump in the 
development of radio-electronic combat in the Soviet 
army.” Though Soviet cryptanalysts lacked the state-of- 
the-art technology which enabled Bletchley Park to 
decrypt high-grade Enigma and Geheimschreiber 
messages, they made major advances during 1943 — 
reluctantly assisted by German cipher personnel captured 
at Stalingrad — in direction-finding, traffic analysis and 
the breaking of lower- grade hand ciphers. In 1942-3 they 
also had the benefit of Luftwaffe Enigma decrypts 
supplied by an agent inside Bletchley Park. 

All these improvements were evident during the battle 
of Kursk in the summer of 1943 when the Red Army 
defeated the last great German offensive on the eastern 
front. Intelligence reports captured by the Wehrmacht 
from the Red Army during the battle revealed that Soviet 
SIGINT had located the positions and headquarters of the 
6th, 7th and 11th Panzer Divisions, II and XIII Panzer 
Corps, and Second Army HQ. Aerial reconnaissance 
before and during Kursk was also on a larger scale and 
more successful than ever before. 

Victory at Kursk opened the way to an almost 
continuous advance by the Red Army on the eastern front 



which was to end with Marshal Zhukov accepting the 
surrender of Berlin in May 1945. With a four-to-one 
superiority in men over the Wehrmacht, large amounts of 
military equipment from its Western allies and growing 
dominance in the air, the Red Army, though suffering 
enormous losses, proved unstoppable. In the course of its 
advance, the Red Army sometimes captured lists of the 
daily settings for periods of up to a month of the 
Wehrmacht’ s Enigma machines, as well as some of the 
machines and their operators. During the final stages of 
the war these captures sometimes enabled Soviet 
cryptanalysts to decrypt spasmodically a still unknown 
number of Enigma messages. 

Despite the improvements after Stalingrad, however, 
the quality of Soviet intelligence on the eastern front — in 
particular the SIGINT — never compared with the 
intelligence on Germany available to their Western allies. 
The ULTRA intelligence provided to British and 
American commanders was, quite simply, the best in the 
history of warfare. The Soviet Union’s most striking 
intelligence successes during the Great Patriotic War, by 
contrast, were achieved not against its enemies but against 
its allies in the wartime Grand Alliance: Britain and the 
United States. 



SEVEN 


THE GRAND ALLIANCE 


For most of the inter- war years the United States had 
ranked some way behind Britain as a target for INO 
operations. Even in the mid- 1930s the main Soviet 
espionage networks in the United States were run by the 
Fourth Department (Military Intelligence, later renamed 
the GRU) rather than by the NKVD. Fourth Department 
agents included a series of young, idealistic high-flyers 
within the federal government, among them: Alger Hiss 
and Julian Wadleigh, both of whom entered the State 
Department in 1936; Harry Dexter White of the Treasury 
Department; and George Silverman, a government 
statistician who probably recruited White. ^ Fike the 
Cambridge Five, the Washington moles saw themselves 
as secret warriors in the struggle against fascism. 
Wadleigh wrote later: 

When the Communist International represented the 
only world force effectively resisting Nazi Germany, 
I had offered my services to the Soviet underground 
in Washington as one small contribution to help stem 



the fascist tide.^ 

The main NKVD operations in the United States during 
the mid- 1930s were run by an illegal residency 
established in 1934 under the former Berlin resident, 
Boris Bazarov (codenamed NORD), with Iskhak 
Abdulovich Akhmerov (YUNG), a Soviet Tartar, as his 
deputy.^ Bazarov was remembered with affection by 
Hede Massing, an Austrian agent in his residency, as the 
warmest personality she had encountered in the NKVD. 
On the anniversary of the October Revolution in 1935 he 
sent her fifty long-stemmed red roses with a note which 
read: 


Our lives are unnatural, but we must endure it for 
[the sake of] humanity. Though we cannot always 
express it, our little group is bound by love and 
consideration for one another. I think of you with 
great warmth. 

Though Akhmerov, by contrast, struck Massing as a 
“Muscovite automaton,” he was less robotic than he 
appeared.^ Unknown to Massing, Akhmerov was engaged 
in a passionate love affair with his assistant, Helen 
Lowry, the cousin of the American Communist Party 
leader, Earl Browder, and — ^unusually — gained 
permission from the Centre to marry her.^ 

Bazarov’s and Akhmerov’s recruits included three 



agents in the State Department: ERIKH, KIY and “19.”^ 
Probably the most important, as well as the only one of 
the three who can be clearly identified, was agent “19,” 
Laurence Duggan, who later became chief of the Latin 
American Division.^ To Hede Massing, Duggan seemed 
“an extremely tense, high-strung, intellectual young 
man.” His recruitment took some time, not least because 
Alger Hiss was simultaneously attempting to recruit him 
for the Fourth Department. In April 1936 Bazarov 
complained to the Centre that the “persistent Hiss” 
showed no sign of abandoning the attempt.^ A year later, 
in the midst of the Moscow show trials, Duggan told 
Akhmerov that he was afraid that, if he “collaborated” 
with Soviet intelligence, he might be exposed by a 
Trotskyite traitor. By the beginning of 1938, however, 
Duggan was supplying Akhmerov with State Department 
documents which were photographed in the illegal 
residency and then returned. In March Duggan reported 
that his close friend Sumner Welles, under-secretary at the 
State Department from 1938 to 1945, had told him he was 
becoming too attracted to Marxism and had given him a 
friendly warning about his left-wing acquaintances.^ 
Duggan’s future in the State Department, however, 
seemed as bright as that of Donald Maclean in the Foreign 
Office. 

The Centre also saw a bright future for Michael 
Straight (codenamed NOMAD and NIGEL), the wealthy 



young American recruited shortly before his graduation 
from Cambridge University in 1937.^^ Its optimism 
sprang far more from Straight’s family connections than 
from any evidence of his enthusiasm for a career as a 
secret agent. Straight’s job hunt after his return to the 
United States began at the top — over tea at the White 
House with Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt. With some 
assistance from Mrs. Roosevelt, he obtained a temporary, 
unpaid assignment in the State Department early in 1938. 
Soon afterwards, he received a phone call from 
Akhmerov, who passed on “greetings from your friends at 
Cambridge University” and invited him to dinner at a 
local restaurant. Akhmerov introduced himself as 
“Michael Green,” then ordered a large meal. Straight 
watched as he ate: 

He was dark and stocky, with broad lips and a ready 
smile. His English was good; his manner was affable 
and easy. He seemed to be enjoying his life in 
America. 

Ahkmerov seemed to accept that it would be some time 
before Straight had access to important documents, but 
was evidently prepared to wait. Before paying the bill, he 
delivered a brief lecture on international relations. 
Straight was “too stunned to think clearly.” Though 
Straight claims that he was “unwilling to become a Soviet 
agent in the Department of State,” he plainly did not say 



so to Akhmerov. The two men “parted as friends” and 
Straight agreed to continue their meetings. 

With the approach of war in Europe, the Centre’s 
interest in the United States steadily increased. In 1938 
the NKVD used the defection of the main Fourth 
Department courier, Whittaker Chambers, as a pretext for 
taking over most of the military intelligence agent 
network, with the notable exception of Alger Hiss.^^ In 
the United States, as elsewhere, however, the expansion 
of NKVD operations was disrupted by the hunt for 
imaginary “enemies of the people.” Ivan Andreyevich 
Morozov (codenamed YUZ and KIR), who was stationed 
in the New York legal residency in 1938-9, sought to 
prove his zeal to the Centre by denouncing the Resident, 
Pyotr Davidovich Gutzeit (codenamed NIKOLAI), and 
most of his colleagues as secret Trotskyists.^^ In 1938 
both Gutzeit and Bazarov, the legal and illegal residents, 
were recalled and shot.^^ Morozov’s denunciation of the 
next legal resident, Gayk Badalovich Ovakimyan 
(codenamed GENNADI), was less successful and may 
have prompted Morozov’s own recall in 1939.^^ 

Bazarov was succeeded as illegal resident by his former 
deputy, Iskhak Akhmerov, who henceforth controlled 
most political intelligence operations in the United 
States. Mitrokhin noted the codenames of eight rather 
diverse individuals in whom the Centre seemed to place 
particularly high hopes on the eve of the Second World 



War:^^ Laurence Duggan (agent “19,” later FRANK) in 
the State Department; Michael Straight (NIGEL), also 
in the State Department; Martha Dodd Stem (LIZA), 
daughter of the former US ambassador to Germany, 
William E. Dodd, and wife of the millionaire Alfred 
Kaufman Stem (also a Soviet agent); Martha’s brother, 
William E. Doss, Jr. (PRESIDENT), who had mn 
unsuccessfully for Congress as a Democrat and still had 
political ambitions; Harry Dexter White in the Treasury 
Department (KASSIR, later JURIST); an agent 
codenamed MORIS (probably John Abt) in the Justice 
Department”; Boris Morros (FROST), the Hollywood 
producer of Laurel and Hardy’s Flying Deuces and other 
box-office hits;^^ Mary Wolf Price (codenamed KID and 
DIR), an undeclared Communist who was secretary to the 
well-known columnist Walter Lippmann; and Henry 
Buchman (KHOSYAIN, “Employer”), owner of a 
women’s fashion salon in Baltimore.^^ 

In August 1939, however, political intelligence 
operations in the United States, as in Britain, were 
partially dismpted by the signing of the Nazi-Soviet Pact. 
Laurence Duggan broke off contact with Akhmerov in 
protest.^^ Others who had serious doubts included 
Michael Straight. At a meeting in October in a restaurant 
below Washington’s Union Station, Akhmerov tried to 
reassure him. “Great days are approaching!” he declared. 
With the beginning of the Second World War, revolution 



would spread like wildfire across Germany and France.^^ 
Straight was unimpressed and failed to attend the next 
meeting.^^ Duggan and Straight are unlikely to have been 
the only agents to break contact, at least temporarily, with 
the NKVD. 

Further disruption to NKVD operations in the United 
States followed Akhmerov’s recall, soon after his last 
meeting with Straight, to Moscow where he was accused 
by Beria of treasonable dealings with enemies of the 
people.^^ Though, for unknown reasons, the charges were 
dropped, Akhmerov was placed in the NKVD reserve and 
remained under suspicion for the next two years while his 
record was thoroughly checked. For the first time, the 
center of NKVD operations in the United States was 
moved, after Akhmerov’s recall, to the legal residency 
headed by Gayk Ovakimyan, later known to the FBI as 
the “wily Armenian.” Ovakimyan found himself terribly 
overworked, all the more so since he was also expected to 
take an active part in the complex preparations for 
Trotsky’s assassination in Mexico City. He would 
sometimes return home exhausted after meeting as many 
as ten agents in a single day.^^ 

Ovakimyan ’s main successes were in scientific and 
technological (S&T), rather than political, intelligence. He 
was unusual among INO officers in holding a science 
doctorate from the MVTU (Moscow Higher Technical 
School) and, since 1933, had operated under cover as an 



engineer at Amtorg (American- Soviet Trading 
Corporation) in New York. In 1940 he enrolled as a 
graduate student at a New York chemical institute to 
assist him in identifying potential agents. Ovakimyan 
was the first to demonstrate the enormous potential for 
S&T in the United States. In 1939 alone NKVD 
operations in the United States obtained 18,000 pages of 
technical documents, 487 sets of designs and 54 samples 
of new technology.^^ 

Ovakimyan was probably also the first to suggest using 
an INO officer, under cover as an exchange student, to 
penetrate the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The 
first such “student,” Semyon Markovich Semyonov 
(codenamed TVEN), entered MIT in 1938. The scientific 
contacts which he made over the next two years, before 
changing his cover in 1940 to that of an Amtorg engineer, 
helped to lay the basis for the remarkable wartime 
expansion of S&T collection in the United States. One of 
his colleagues in the New York residency was struck by 
Semyonov’s “large eyes which, while he was talking to 
somebody, [revolved] like parabolic antennae. By 
April 1941 the total NKVD agent network in the United 
States numbered 221, of whom forty-nine were listed in 
NKVD statistics as “engineers” (probably a category 
which included a rather broad range of scientists). In the 
same month the Centre for the first time established 
separate departments in its major residencies to specialize 



in scientific and technological intelligence operations 
(later known as Line X), a certain sign of their increasing 
priority.^ ^ 

According to an SVR official history, the sheer number 
of agents with whom Ovakimyan was in contact “blunted 
his vigilance.” In May 1941 he was caught by the FBI in 
the act of receiving documents from agent OCTANE, 
briefly imprisoned, freed on bail and allowed to leave the 
country in July.^^ But for the remarkably lax security of 
the Roosevelt administration, the damage to NKVD 
operations might have been very much worse than the 
arrest of Ovakimyan. On September 2, 1939, the day after 
the outbreak of war in Europe, Whittaker Chambers had 
told much of what he knew about Soviet espionage in the 
United States to Adolf Berle, Assistant Secretary of State 
and President Roosevelt’s adviser on internal security. 
Immediately afterwards, Berle drew up a memorandum 
for the President which listed Alger Hiss, Harry Dexter 
White and the other leading Soviet agents for whom 
Chambers had acted as courier. One of those on the list 
was a leading presidential aide, Lauchlin Currie 
(mistranscribed by Berle as Lockwood Curry). Roosevelt, 
however, was not interested. He seems to have dismissed 
the whole idea of espionage rings within his 
administration as absurd. Equally remarkable, Berle 
simply pigeon-holed his own report. He did not even send 
a copy to the FBI until the Bureau requested it in 1943.^^ 



IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE Japanese attack on Pearl 
Harbor and Hitler’s declaration of war on the United 
States in December 1941, Vassili Zarubin (alias Zubilin, 
codenamed MAKSIM) was appointed legal resident in 
New York. Already deeply suspicious of British 
commitment to the defeat of Nazi Germany, Stalin also 
had doubts about American resolve. He summoned 
Zarubin before his departure and told him that his main 
assignment in the United States was to watch out for 
attempts by Roosevelt and “US ruling circles” to 
negotiate with Hitler and sign a separate peace. As 
resident in New York, based in the Soviet consulate, 
Zarubin was also responsible for subresidencies in 
Washington, San Francisco, and Latin America.^^ Though 
fragmentary, the evidence suggests that Stalin continued 
to take a direct personal interest in overseeing intelligence 
operations against his allies. 

A brief official SVR biography portrays Zarubin’s 
wartime record in New York (and later in Washington) as 
one of unblemished brilliance. In reality, his abrasive 
personality and foul-mouthed behavior caused immediate 
uproar. Zarubin’s preference for the operations officers 
whom he brought with him (among them his wife, 
Yelizaveta Yulyevna Zarubina)^^ and his unconcealed 
contempt for existing residency staff led to open 
rebellion. Two of the operations officers whom he 



insulted, Vasili Dmitry evich Mironov and Vasili 
Georgyevich Dorogov, went to the remarkable lengths of 
reporting “his crudeness, general lack of manners, use of 
street language and obscenities, carelessness in his work, 
and repugnant secretiveness” to the Centre, and asking for 
his recall along with his almost equally unpopular wife. 
Feuding within the residency continued throughout the 
Second World War.^^ 

Zarubin’s recruitment strategy was simple and 
straightforward. He demanded that the leaders of the 
Communist Party of the United States (CPUS A) identify 
supporters and sympathizers in government 
establishments suitable for work as agents. When 
Zarubin arrived in New York, the CPUS A leader Earl 
Browder (codenamed RULE VO Y — “Helmsman”) was 
serving a prison sentence for using a false passport during 
his frequent secret journeys to the Soviet Union. His first 
contact was therefore with Eugene Dennis (bom Francis 
X. Waldron, codenamed RYAN), a Moscowtrained 
Comintern agent who later succeeded Browder as CPUS A 
general secretary. Dennis reported that a number of 
Communists (mostly secret Party members) were joining 
the first professional American foreign intelligence 
agency, the Office of the Coordinator of Information, 
reorganized in June 1942 as the Office of Strategic 
Services (OSS). Shortly before the foundation of OSS, 
Browder left prison to resume the Party leadership. He 



was, Dennis told Moscow, “in a splendid mood.”^^ 

Among the first Soviet agents to penetrate OSS was 
Duncan Chaplin Lee (codenamed KOCH), who became 
personal assistant to its head. General “Wild Bill” 
Donovan. Donovan had a relaxed attitude to the 
recruitment of Communists. “I’d put Stalin on the OSS 
payroll,” he once said, “if I thought it would help us 
defeat Hitler.” Throughout the Second World War the 
NKVD knew vastly more about OSS than OSS knew 
about the NKVD.^o 

Browder’s recruitment leads also included foreign 
Communists and fellow travelers who had taken refuge in 
the United States. Among the most important was the 
French radical politician Pierre Cot, six times Minister of 
Air and twice Minister of Commerce in the short-lived 
governments of the prewar Third Republic. Cot had 
probably been recruited by the NKVD in the mid- 1930s, 
but seems to have drifted out of touch during the chaotic 
period which followed the purge of much of Soviet 
foreign intelligence and had condemned the signing of the 
Nazi-Soviet Pact. Rebuffed by General Charles de Gaulle, 
the leader of the Free French after the fall of France in 
1940, Cot spent the next few years in the United States. 

In November Browder reported to Moscow: “Cot wants 
the leaders of the Soviet Union to know of his willingness 
to perform whatever mission we might choose, for which 
purpose he is even prepared to break faith with his own 



position. Probably a month or so after his arrival in 
New York, Zarubin approached Cot and, with his habitual 
brusqueness, pressed Cot to begin active work as a Soviet 
agent forthwith. Cot’s KGB file records that he was taken 
aback by the peremptory nature of Zarubin’s summons 
and insisted that one of the leaders of the French 
Communist Party exiled in Moscow give his approval.^^ 
On July 1 Zarubin reported to the Centre “the signing on 
of Pierre Cot” as agent DAEDALUS.^^ In 1944 Cot was 
to be sent on a three-month mission to Moscow on behalf 
of de Gaulle’s provisional government. He concluded the 
report on his mission: “Liberty declines unceasingly 
under capitalism and rises unceasingly under 
socialism.”^^ 

Though the Centre was plainly impressed by the quality 
of Communist recruits talent- spotted by Browder, it 
cautioned Zarubin against over-reliance on them: 

We permit the use of the Communist [Party 
members’] illegal intelligence capabilities ... as a 
supplement to the Residency’s operations, but it 
would be a mistake to turn these capabilities into the 
main basis of operations. 

At almost the same moment in December 1941 when 
Zarubin arrived in New York as legal resident, Iskhak 
Akhmerov (successively codenamed YUNG and 
ALBERT) returned to reestablish the illegal residency. 



also based in New York, which he had been ordered to 
abandon two years earlier. Though he had previously used 
Turkish and Canadian identity documents, on this 
occasion he carried a doctored US passport which he had 
acquired in 1938.^^ Unlike Zarubin, Akhmerov avoided 
all contact with Browder — despite the fact that his wife 
and assistant, Helen Lowry (codenamed MADLEN and 
ADA), was Browder’s niece.^^ In March 1942 the 
Akhmerovs moved from New York to Baltimore, a more 
convenient location from which to run agents based in 
Washington. There Akhmerov, whose stepfather had been 
a furrier, opened a fiir and clothes business in partnership 
with a local Soviet agent, KHOSYAIN, to give himself a 
cover occupation.^^ 

Michael Straight (NIGEL), in whom Akhmerov had 
placed such high hopes before the Second World War, 
refused to resume work as a Soviet agent. Straight had 
one last meeting with Akhmerov in Washington early in 
1942, declined any further meeting, shook hands and said 
goodbye. Most other pre-war agents, however, were 
successfully reactivated, among them Laurence Duggan 
(FRANK)^i and Harry Dexter White (JURIST).^^ 
Wallace, vice-president during Roosevelt’s third term of 
office (1941 to 1945), said later that if the ailing 
Roosevelt had died during that period and he had become 
president, it had been his intention to make Duggan his 
Secretary of State and White his Secretary of the 



Treasury.^^ The fact that Roosevelt survived three months 
into an unprecedented fourth term in the White House, 
and replaced Wallace with Harry Truman as vice- 
president in January 1945, deprived Soviet intelligence of 
what would have been its most spectacular success in 
penetrating a major Western government. The NKVD 
succeeded none the less in penetrating all the most 
sensitive sections of the Roosevelt administration. 

Akhmerov’s most productive Washington network was 
a group of Communists and fellow travelers with 
government jobs run by Nathan Gregory Silvermaster 
(successively codenamed PAL and ROBERT), a 
statistician in the Farm Security Administration, later 
seconded to the Board of Economic Warfare. “Greg” 
Silvermaster retained the untarnished idealism of the 
revolutionary dream. A chronic sufferer from bronchial 
asthma, which often left him gasping for breath, he 
believed that, “My time is strictly limited, and when I die 
I want to feel that at least I have had some part in building 
a decent life for those who come after me.”^^ 

Akhmerov believed, probably correctly, that, despite 
the security risks involved in Silvermaster ’s unorthodox 
tradecraft, he was able to obtain far more intelligence 
from his increasing number of sources than if each of 
them was run individually by a Soviet controller. 
Silvermaster himself disdained the NKVD’s bureaucratic 
“orthodox methods.” Though most of his sources must 



have been aware of the ultimate destination of their 
intelligence, the network was run under what Akhmerov 
termed “the Communist Party flag.” Informants regarded 
themselves as helping the CPUS A, which would in turn 
assist its Soviet comrades. 

To limit the security risks, Akhmerov placed two cut- 
outs between himself and the Silvermaster group. The 
first was a courier, Elizabeth Bentley (codenamed 
MIRNA, then, more condescendingly, UMNITSA 
— “Good Girl”), a Vassar graduate who in 1938, at the 
age of thirty, had been persuaded to break her visible 
links with the CPUS A in order to work for the NKVD. 
Every fortnight Bentley collected classified documents 
microfilmed by Silvermaster and his wife in her knitting 
bag. She reported not to Akhmerov himself but to another 
Soviet illegal in his residency, Jacob Golos (ZVUK 
— “Sound”), whom she knew as “Timmy.” Golos broke 
NKVD rules by seducing Bentley during a New York 
snowstorm. According to Bentley’s enthusiastic 
description of the seduction, she felt herself “float away 
into an ecstasy that seemed to have no beginning and no 
end.” Encouraged by Golos ’s unprofessional example, 
Bentley mixed friendship and espionage in a way which 
would have horrified the Centre. Each Christmas she used 
NKVD funds to buy carefully chosen presents, ranging 
from whiskey to lingerie, for the agents in Silvermaster’ s 
group. These, she said later, were “the good old days — the 
days when we worked together as good comrades. 



Like Zarubin’s, Akhmerov’s illegal residency recruited 
non- American as well as American agents. Among the 
most important was the British journalist and wartime 
intelligence officer Cedric Belfrage (codenamed 
CHARLIE), who joined British Security Coordination 
(BSC) in New York shortly after the United States entered 
the war.^^ Directed by the SIS head of station. Sir William 
Stephenson, for much of the war, BSC handled 
intelligence liaison with the Americans on behalf of MI5 
and SOE as well as SIS.^^ Belfrage volunteered his 
services to Soviet intelligence. Like a number of other 
American agents in the United States, he made his initial 
approach to Earl Browder, who passed him on to Golos.^^ 
Given the unprecedented number of wartime secrets 
exchanged by the British and American intelligence 
communities, Belfrage had access to an unusually wide 
range of intelligence. 

The rolls of microfilm forwarded by Akhmerov’s 
illegal residency to the Centre via the legal residency in 
New York increased almost four- fold in the space of a 
year, from fifty-nine in 1942 to 21 1 in 1943. Zarubin none 
the less regarded Akhmerov’s refusal to have direct 
dealings with the CPUS A leadership and his roundabout 
methods of controlling the Silvermaster group as feeble 
and long-winded. Akhmerov himself, Zarubin 
complained, had a “dry and distrustful” manner — ^which 
may well have been true as far as his relations with 



Zarubin were concerned. Zarubin had a much higher 
opinion of Akhmerov’s wife, Helen Lowry, whom he 
regarded as more quick-witted, more business-like in 
manner, and — ^because of her American upbringing — 
better able to make direct contact with US agents. 

THERE WAS THUS a breathtaking gulf between the 
intelligence supplied to Stalin on the United States and 
that available to Roosevelt on the Soviet Union.^^ 
Whereas the Centre had penetrated every major branch of 
Roosevelt’s administration, OSS — like SIS — had not a 
single agent in Moscow. At the Tehran Conference of the 
Big Three in November 1943 — the first time Stalin and 
Roosevelt had met — vastly superior intelligence gave 
Stalin a considerable negotiating advantage. Though there 
is no precise indication of what intelligence reports and 
documents were shown to Stalin before the summit, there 
can be no doubt that he was remarkably well briefed. He 
was almost certainly informed that Roosevelt had come to 
Tehran determined to do his utmost to reach agreement 
with Stalin — even at the cost of offending Churchill. FDR 
gave proof of his intentions as soon as he arrived. He 
declined Churchill’s proposal that they should meet 
privately before the conference began, but accepted 
Stalin’s pressing invitation that — allegedly on security 
grounds — he should stay at a building in the Soviet 
embassy compound rather than at the US legation. It 
seems not to have occurred to Roosevelt that the building 



was, inevitably, bugged, and that every word uttered by 
himself and his delegation would be recorded, transcribed 
and regularly reported to Stalin. 

Stalin must also have welcomed the fact that Roosevelt 
was bringing to Tehran his closest wartime adviser, Harry 
Hopkins, but leaving behind his Secretary of State, 
Cordell Hull. Hopkins had established a remarkable 
reputation in Moscow for taking the Russians into his 
confidence. Earlier in the year he had privately warned 
the Soviet embassy in Washington that the FBI had 
bugged a secret meeting at which Zarubin (apparently 
identified by Hopkins only as a member of the embassy) 
had passed money to Steve Nelson, a leading member of 
the US Communist underground. Information sent to 
Moscow by the New York residency on the talks between 
Roosevelt and Churchill in May 1943 had also probably 
come from Hopkins. There is plausible but 
controversial evidence that, in addition to passing 
confidences to the Soviet ambassador, Hopkins 
sometimes used Akhmerov as a back channel to Moscow, 
much as the Kennedys later used the GRU officer Georgi 
Bolshakov. Hopkins’s confidential information so 
impressed the Centre that, years later, some KGB officers 
boasted that he had been a Soviet agent. These boasts 
were far from the truth. Hopkins was an American patriot 
with little sympathy for the Soviet system. But he was 
deeply impressed by the Soviet war effort and convinced 



that, “Since Russia is the decisive factor in the war she 
must be given every assistance and every effort must be 
made to obtain her friendship. “Chip” Bohlen, who 
acted as American interpreter, later described Hopkins’s 
influence on the President at the Tehran summit as 
“paramount. 

It was at Tehran, Churchill later claimed, that he 
realized for the first time how small the British nation 
was: 


There I sat with the great Russian bear on one side of 
me, with paws outstretched, and on the other side the 
great American buffalo, and between the two sat the 
poor little English donkey ...^^ 

Despite the closeness of the British-American wartime 
“special relationship” and Roosevelt’s friendship with 
Churchill, his priority at Tehran was to reach agreement 
with Stalin. He told his old friend, Frances Perkins, the 
Secretary of Labor, how 

Winston got red and scowled, and the more he did 
so, the more Stalin smiled. Finally, Stalin broke out 
into a deep, hearty guffaw, and for the first time in 
three days I saw light. I kept it up until Stalin was 
laughing with me, and it was then that I called him 
“Uncle Joe.” He would have thought me fresh the 
day before, but that day he laughed and came over 



and shook my hand. 

From that time on our relations were personal ... 

We talked like men and brothers.^^ 

In the course of the Tehran Conference, Hopkins sought 
out Churchill privately at the British embassy, and told 
him that Stalin and Roosevelt were adamant that 
Operation OVERLORD, the British-American cross- 
Channel invasion of occupied France, must take place the 
following spring, and that British opposition must cease. 
Churchill duly gave way. The most important political 
concession to Stalin was British-American agreement to 
give the post-war Soviet Union its 1941 frontier, thus 
allowing Stalin to recover his territorial gains ill-gotten 
under the Nazi-Soviet Pact: eastern Poland, the Baltic 
states and Moldova. The Polish govemment-in-exile in 
London was not consulted. 

Stalin returned to Moscow in high spirits. The United 
States and Britain seemed to have recognized, as a 
Russian diplomat put it privately, Russia’s “right to 
establish friendly governments in the neighboring 
countries. Roosevelt’s willingness to go so far to meet 
Stalin’s wishes at Tehran had derived chiefly from his 
deep sense of the West’s military debt to the Soviet Union 
at a time when the Red Army was bearing the 
overwhelming brunt of the war with Germany. But there 
is equally no doubt that Stalin’s negotiating success was 
greatly assisted by his knowledge of the cards in 



Roosevelt’s handJ^ 

Despite the considerable success of the legal and illegal 
American residencies in penetrating the Roosevelt 
administration, however, they had failed totally in one 
important respect. Part of Zarubin’s original brief from 
the Centre had been to recruit agents from among the 
large German-American community who could be used 
against Germany. In the end he recruited not a single one. 
When asked to explain this omission, he told the Centre 
that most German-Americans were Jews and therefore 
unsuitable. The Centre, like Zarubin, had become so 
engrossed in the intelligence offensive against its allies 
that it appears to have judged leniently his failure against 
the enemy. 

WARTIME INTELLIGENCE GATHERING continued 
to expand in Britain as well as the United States. At the 
beginning of 1942 a second legal residency began to 
operate in London under Ivan Andreyevich Chichayev 
(JOHN) alongside that of Anatoli Gorsky (successively 
HENRY and VADIM). Unlike Gorsky, who remained in 
charge of the agent network, Chichayev announced his 
presence in London to the authorities and was responsible 
for intelligence liaison with both the British and allied 
govemments-in-exile.^^ Chichayev also ran an agent 
network of emigre officials from central and eastern 
Europe who kept him informed of British negotiations 



with the Polish govemment-in-exile, the Czechoslovak 
president, Edvard Bene's, King Peter of Yugoslavia and 
his prime minister, Ivan Subas7^ 

The Cambridge Five, meanwhile, continued to generate 
a phenomenal amount of intelligence. For 1942 alone 
Maclean’s documents filled more than forty-five volumes 
in the Centre archives. Philby too was providing large 
quantities of highly classified files. Since September 1941 
he had been working in Section V (Counter-intelligence) 
of SIS. Though Section V was then located in St. Albans, 
rather than in SIS Fondon headquarters at Broadway 
Buildings, it had the advantage of being next door to the 
registry which housed SIS archives. Philby spent some 
time cultivating the archivist. Bill Woodfield, with whom 
he shared a common appreciation of pink gin. As Philby 
later recalled, “This friendly connection paid off.”^^ Over 
a period of months, Philby borrowed the operational files 
of British agents working abroad and handed them to 
Gorsky in batches to be photographed.^^ Early in April 
1942 the Centre completed a lengthy analysis of the SIS 
records removed by Philby up to the end of the previous 
year. Though praising SOHNCHEN for “systematically 
sending a lot of interesting material,” it was puzzled that 
this material appeared to show that SIS had no agent 
network in Russia and was conducting only “extremely 
insignificanf ’ operations against the Soviet Union. Centre 
analysts had two reasons for disputing these entirely 



accurate conclusions. First, though at least partly aware 
that the evidence used to convict some of their liquidated 
predecessors of working for British intelligence was 
fraudulent, they remained convinced that SIS had been 
conducting major operations against the Soviet Union, 
using “their most highly skilled agents,” throughout the 
1930s. The reality — that SIS had not even possessed a 
Moscow station — was, so far as the Centre was 
concerned, literally unbelievable. The Centre refused to 
believe that the Soviet Union was a smaller priority for 
British intelligence (which was, in truth, almost wholly 
geared to the war effort) than Britain was for Soviet 
intelligence: 

If the HOTEL [SIS] has recruited a hundred agents 
in Europe over the past few years, mainly from 
countries occupied by the Germans, there can be no 
doubt that our country gets no less attention. 

Such reports merely echoed Stalin’s own acute suspicions 
of his British allies. 

The intelligence from the London residency during the 
first year of the Great Patriotic War which ultimately had 
the greatest impact on both Stalin and the Centre came 
from Caimcross. On September 25, 1941 Gorsky 
telegraphed Moscow: 


I am informing you very briefly about the contents of 



a most secret report of the Government Committee 
on the development of uranium atomic energy to 
produce explosive material which was submitted on 
September 24, 1941 to the War Cabinet. 

The secret committee which produced the report was the 
Scientific Advisory Committee, chaired by Lord Hankey, 
whose codename BOSS reflects the fact he was 
Caimcross’s employer. The report which Caimcross 
gave Gorsky was the first to alert the Centre to British 
plans to build the atomic bomb.^^ 

Vitally important though that report, and others on the 
atomic bomb despatched from London over the next few 
months, proved to be, they had a delayed impact in 
Moscow. When Caimcross’s first report arrived, Stalin 
and the Stavka were preoccupied by the German advance 
which in October 1941 forced them to evacuate the 
capital. It was not until March 1942 that Beria sent Stalin 
a full assessment of British atomic research. The British 
high command, he reported, was now satisfied that the 
theoretical problems of constmcting an atomic bomb had 
been “fundamentally solved,” and Britain’s best scientists 
and major companies were collaborating on the project. 
At Beria’ s suggestion, detailed consultations with Soviet 
scientists followed over the next few months. 

In June 1942 President Roosevelt ordered an all-out 
effort, codenamed the MANHATTAN project, to build an 



American atomic bomb. Though it was another year 
before British participation in the project was formally 
agreed, the NKVD discovered that Roosevelt and 
Churchill had discussed cooperation on the building of the 
bomb during talks in Washington on June 20.^^ On 
October 6, following extensive consultations with Soviet 
scientists, the Centre submitted the first detailed report on 
Anglo-American plans to construct an atomic bomb to the 
Central Committee and the State Defence Committee, 
both chaired by Stalin. By the end of the year, Stalin 
had decided to begin work on the construction of a Soviet 
atomic bomb.^^ In taking that momentous decision in the 
middle of the battle of Stalingrad, the main turning point 
in the war on the eastern front, Stalin was not thinking of 
the needs of the Great Patriotic War, since it was clear 
that the bomb could not be ready in time to assist in the 
defeat of Germany. Instead, he was already looking 
forward to a post-war world in which, since the United 
States and Britain would have nuclear weapons, the 
Soviet Union must have them too.^^ 

For most of the Great Patriotic War Moscow collected 
more atomic intelligence from Britain than from the 
United States. In December 1942 the London residency 
received a detailed report on atomic research in Britain 
and the United States from a Communist scientist 
codenamed “K.” Vladimir Barkovsky, head of scientific 
and technological intelligence (S&T) at the residency. 



later reported that “K” “works for us with enthusiasm, but 
... turns down the slightest hint of financial reward.” With 
the help of a duplicate key personally manufactured by 
Barkovsky from a wax impression provided by “K,” he 
was able to remove numerous classified documents from 
colleagues’ safes as well as his own. The most valuable, 
in the Centre’s view, were those on “the construction of 
uranium piles.” At least two other scientists, codenamed 
MOOR and KELLY, also provided intelligence on 
various aspects of TUBE ALLOYS, the British atomic 
project. 

The most important of the British atom spies, the 
Communist physicist Klaus Fuchs, a naturalized refugee 
from Nazi Germany, was initially a GRU rather than an 
NKVD/NKGB agent. Fuchs was a committed Stalinist 
who was later to take part in the construction of the first 
atomic bomb. Before the war he had been an enthusiastic 
participant in dramatized readings of the transcripts of the 
show trials organized by the Society for Cultural 
Relations with the Soviet Union, and impressed his 
research supervisor, the future Nobel Laureate Sir Neville 
Mott, with the passion with which he played the part of 
the prosecutor Vyshinsky, “accusing the defendants with 
a cold venom that I would never have suspected from so 
quiet and retiring a young man.” Late in 1941, Fuchs 
asked the leader of the German Communist Party (KPD) 
underground in Britain, Jurgen Kuczynski, for help in 
passing to the Russians what he had learned while 



working on the TUBE ALLOYS project at Birmingham 
University. Kuczynski put him in touch with Simon 
Davidovich Kremer, an officer at the GRU London 
residency, who irritated Fuchs by his insistence on taking 
long rides in London taxis, regularly doubling back in 
order to throw off anyone trying to tail them.^^ 

In the summer of 1942 Fuchs was moved on to another 
and more congenial GRU controller, SONYA (referred to 
in KGB files under the alternative codename FIR),^^ who 
he almost certainly never realized was the sister of Jurgen 
Kuczynski. They usually met near Banbury, midway 
between Birmingham and Oxford, where SONYA lived 
as Mrs. Brewer, a Jewish refugee from Nazi Germany. 
SONYA remembered the material she collected from 
Fuchs as “just strings of hieroglyphics and formula 
written in such tiny writing that they just looked like 
squiggles:” 

Klaus and I never spent more than half an hour 
together when we met. Two minutes would have 
been enough but, apart from the pleasure of the 
meeting, it would arouse less suspicion if we took a 
little walk together rather than parting immediately. 
Nobody who did not live in such isolation can guess 
how precious these meetings with another German 
comrade were.^^ 


SONYA later became the only woman ever to be made 



an honorary colonel of the Red Army, in recognition of 
her remarkable achievements in the GRU^^ But though it 
has been publicly acknowledged that she ran other agents 
besides Fuchs during her time in Britain, both the SVR 
and the GRU have gone to some pains to conceal the 
existence of the most important of them: Melita Stedman 
Norwood, nee Semis (codenamed HOLA). Norwood’s 
file in the Centre shows her to have been, in all 
probability, both the most important British female agent 
in KGB history and the longest- serving of all Soviet spies 
in Britain. 

HOLA was bom in 1912 to a Latvian father and British 
mother, joined the Communist Party of Great Britain 
(CPGB), married another Party member employed as a 
mathematics teacher in a secondary school, and from the 
age of twenty onwards worked as a secretary in the 
research department of the British Non-Ferrous Metals 
Association. Talent-spotted in 1935 by one of the CPGB’s 
founders, Andrew Rothstein, she was recommended to the 
NKVD by the Party leadership and recmited two years 
later. Like the Magnificent Five, Norwood was a 
committed ideological agent inspired by a myth-image of 
the Soviet Union which bore little relationship to the 
bmtal reality of Stalinist mle. Her forty-year career as a 
Soviet agent, however, nearly ended almost as soon as it 
began. She was involved with a spy ring operating inside 
the Woolwich Arsenal, whose three leading members 
were arrested in January 1938, tried and imprisoned three 



months later. MI5 failed, however, to detect clues to her 
identity contained in a notebook taken from the 
ringleader, Percy Glading (codenamed GOT), and after a 
few months “on ice” she was reactivated in May 1938. It 
is a sign of the Centre’s high opinion of Norwood that 
contact with her was maintained at a time when it was 
broken with many other agents, including some of the 
Five, because of the recall or liquidation of most foreign 
intelligence officers. 

Contact with Norwood was suspended, however, after 
the temporary closure of the London residency early in 
1940. When reactivated in 1941, she was for unexplained 
reasons handed over to SONYA of the GRU rather than to 
an NKVD controller. Her job at the Non-Ferrous Metals 
Association gave her access to extensive S&T documents 
which she passed on to SONYA and subsequent 
controllers. By the final months of the war Norwood was 
providing intelligence on the TUBE ALLOYS project. 
According to Mitrokhin’s notes on her file, she was 
assessed throughout her career as a “committed, reliable 
and disciplined agent, striving to be of the utmost 
assistance. 

By the beginning of 1943, aware of American plans to 
build the first atomic bomb, the Centre was even more 
anxious to collect atomic intelligence in the United States 
than in Britain. One certain indication of the importance 
attached by the Centre to monitoring the MANHATTAN 
project was the dispatch of its head of scientific and 



technological intelligence, Leonid Romanovich 
Kvasnikov (ANTON), to New York where he became 
deputy resident for S&T in January 1943.^^ Igor 
Vasiliy evich Kurchatov, the newly appointed scientific 
head of the Soviet atomic project, wrote to Beria on 
March 7: 

My examination of the [intelligence] material has 
shown that their receipt is of enormous and 
invaluable significance to our nation and our science. 
On the one hand, the material has demonstrated the 
seriousness and intensity of the scientific research 
being conducted on uranium in Britain, and on the 
other hand, it has made it possible to obtain 
important guidelines for our own scientific research, 
by-passing many extremely difficult phases in the 
development of this problem, learning new scientific 
and technical routes for its development, establishing 
three new areas for Soviet physics, and learning 
about the possibilities for using not only uranium- 
235 but also uranium-238.^^ 

While Beria was reading the report, a new top-secret 
laboratory was starting work at Los Alamos in New 
Mexico to build the first atomic bomb. Los Alamos 
contained probably the most remarkable collection of 
youthful talent ever assembled in a single laboratory. A 
majority of the scientists who worked on the bomb were 



still in their twenties; the oldest, Robert Oppenheimer, the 
head of the laboratory, was thirtynine. Los Alamos 
eventually included twelve Nobel Laureates. 

In April 1943, a month after the opening of Los 
Alamos, the New York residency reported an important 
source on the MANHATTAN project. An unknown 
woman had turned up at the Soviet consulate-general and 
delivered a letter containing classified information on the 
atomic weapons program. A month later the same woman, 
who again declined to give her name, brought another 
letter with details of research on the plutonium route to 
the atomic bomb. Investigations by the New York 
residency revealed that the woman was an Italian nurse, 
whose first name was Lucia, the daughter of an anti- 
fascist Italian union leader, “D.” At a meeting arranged by 
the residency through the leaders of the Friends of the 
USSR Society, Lucia said that she was acting only as an 
intermediary. The letters came from her brother-in-law, an 
American scientist working on plutonium research for the 
Du Pont company in Newport while completing a degree 
course in New York, who had asked his wife Regina to 
pass his correspondence to the Soviet consulate via her 
sister Lucia. The scientist — apparently the first of the 
American atom spies — was recruited under the codename 
MAR; Regina became MONA and Lucia OLIVIA.^^ 

In June the New York residency forwarded intelligence 
on uranium isotope separation through gaseous diffusion 
from an unidentified agent codenamed KVANT 



(“Quantum”) working for the MANHATTAN project. 
KVANT demanded payment and was given 300 
dollars. On July 3, after examining the latest atomic 
intelligence from the United States, Kurchatov wrote to 
the NKVD (probably to Beria in person): 

I have examined the attached list of American 
projects on uranium. Almost every one of them is of 
great interest to us ... These materials are of 
enormous interest and great value ... The receipt of 
further information of this type is extremely 
desirable. 

As yet, however, atomic intelligence from the United 
States was less detailed than that obtained from Britain in 
1941-2.^^^ Among those who supplied some of the further 
intelligence requested by Kurchatov was MAR, who in 
October 1943 was transferred to the Du Pont plant in 
Hanford, Washington State, which produced plutonium 
for the MANHATTAN project. He told his controller that 
his aim was to defeat the “criminal” attempt of the US 
military to conceal the construction of an atomic bomb 
from the USSR.^^^ Other sources of atomic intelligence 
included a “progressive professor” in the radiation 
laboratory at Berkeley, California, and — ^probably — a 
scientist in the MANHATTAN project’s metallurgical 
laboratory at Chicago University. The mercenary 



KVANT seems to have faded away, but by early 1944 
another agent, a Communist construction engineer 
codenamed FOGEL (later PERS), was providing 
intelligence on the plant and equipment being used in the 
MANHATTAN project. There is, however, no reliable 
evidence that Soviet intelligence yet had an agent inside 
Los Alamos. 

The penetration of the MANHATTAN project was 
only the most spectacular part of a vast wartime 
expansion of Soviet scientific and technological 
espionage. S&T from the United States and Britain made 
a major contribution to the development of Soviet radar, 
radio technology, submarines, jet engines, aircraft and 
synthetic rubber, as well as nuclear weapons. Atomic 
intelligence was codenamed ENORMOZ (“Enormous”), 
jet propulsion VOZDUKH (“Air”), radar RADUGA 
(“Rainbow”). A. S. Yakovlev, the aircraft designer and 
Deputy Commissar of the Aviation Industry, paid 
handsome, though private, tribute to the contribution of 
S&T to the Soviet aircraft which bore his name.^^^ 
Political and military intelligence from inside all the main 
branches of the Roosevelt administration also continued 
to expand, thanks chiefly to the increasing activity of 
Akhmerov’s Washington networks. The rolls of film of 
classified documents sent by his illegal residency to 
Moscow via New York increased from 21 1 in 1943 to 600 

in 1944.111 



THE QUALITY OF political intelligence from Britain 
probably exceeded even that from the United States, 
partly as a result of the greater coordination of British 
government and intelligence assessment through the War 
Cabinet and the Joint Intelligence Committee (of which 
there were no real equivalents in the United States, 
despite the existence of bodies with similar names). The 
wartime files of the London residency contain what 
Mitrokhin’s summary describes as “many secrets of the 
British War Cabinet,” correspondence between Churchill 
and Roosevelt, telegrams exchanged between the Foreign 
Office, the embassies in Moscow, Washington, 
Stockholm, Ankara and Tehran, and the minister-resident 
in Cairo, and intelligence reports. From the summer of 
1942 to the summer of 1943, the intelligence reports 
included ULTRA decrypts direct from Bletchley Park, the 
main wartime home of the British SIGINT agency, where 
John Caimcross spent a year as a Soviet agent. His 
controller, Anatoli Gorsky, whom, like the rest of the 
Five, he knew as “Henry,” gave him the money to buy a 
second-hand car to bring ULTRA to London on his days 
off.^^^ Because of the unprecedented wartime 
collaboration of the Anglo-American intelligence 
communities, the London residency was also able to 
provide American as well as British intelligence. 

The problem for the professionally suspicious minds in 



the Centre was that it all seemed too good to be true. 
Taking their cue from the master conspiracy theorist in 
the Kremlin, they eventually concluded that what 
appeared to be the best intelligence ever obtained from 
Britain by any intelligence service was at root a British 
plot. The Five, later acknowledged as the ablest group of 
agents in KGB history, were discredited in the eyes of the 
Centre leadership by their failure to provide evidence of a 
massive, non-existent British conspiracy against the 
Soviet Union. Of the reality of that conspiracy, Stalin, and 
therefore his chief intelligence advisers, had no doubt. In 
October 1942 Stalin wrote to the Soviet ambassador in 
Britain, Ivan Maisky: 

All of us in Moscow have gained the impression that 
Churchill is aiming at the defeat of the USSR, in 
order then to come to terms with the Germany of 
Hitler or Briining at the expense of our country. 

Always in Stalin’s mind when he brooded on Churchill’s 
supposed wartime conspiracies against him was the figure 
of Hitler’s deputy Fiihrer, Rudolf Hess, whom, he told 
Maisky, Churchill was keeping “in reserve.” In May 1941 
Hess had made a bizarre flight to Scotland, in the deluded 
belief that he could arrange peace between Britain and 
Germany. Both London and Berlin correctly concluded 
that Hess was somewhat deranged. Stalin, inevitably, 
believed instead that Hess’s flight was part of a deeply 



laid British plot. His suspicions deepened after the 
German invasion in June. For at least the next two years 
he suspected that Hess was part of a British conspiracy to 
abandon its alliance with the Soviet Union and sign a 
separate peace with Germany.^ At dinner with Churchill 
in the Kremlin in October 1944 Stalin proposed a toast to 
“the British intelligence service which had inveigled Hess 
into coming to England:” “He could not have landed 
without being given signals. The intelligence service must 
have been behind it all.”^^^ Stalin’s mood at dinner was 
jovial, but his conspiracy theory was deadly earnest. If his 
misunderstanding of Hess’s flight to Britain did not derive 
from Centre intelligence assessments, it was certainly 
reinforced by them. As late as the early 1990s the same 
conspiracy theory was still being publicly propounded by 
a KGB spokesman who claimed that in 1941 Hess 
“brought the Fiihrer’s peace proposals with him and a 
plan for the invasion of the Soviet Union.” That myth is 
still, apparently, believed by some of their SVR 
successors. 

On October 25, 1943 the Centre informed the London 
residency that it was now clear, after long analysis of the 
voluminous intelligence from the Five, that they were 
double agents, working on the instructions of SIS and 
MI5. As far back as their years at Cambridge, Philby, 
Maclean and Burgess had probably been acting on 
instructions from British intelligence to infiltrate the 



student left before making contact with the NKVD. Only 
thus, the Centre reasoned, was it possible to explain why 
both SIS and MI5 were currently employing in highly 
sensitive jobs Cambridge graduates with a Communist 
background. The lack of any reference to British 
recruitment of Soviet agents in the intelligence supplied 
either by SOHNCHEN (Philby) from SIS or by TONY 
(Blunt) from MI5 was seen as further evidence that both 
were being used to feed disinformation to the NKGB: 

During the entire period that S[OHNCHEN] and 
T[ONY] worked for the British special services, they 
did not help expose a single valuable ISLANDERS 
[British] agent either in the USSR or in the Soviet 
embassy in the ISLAND [Britain]. 

There was, of course, no such “valuable agent” for Philby 
or Blunt to expose, but that simple possibility did not 
occur to the conspiracy theorists in the Centre. Philby ’s 
accurate report that “at the present time the HOTEL [SIS] 
is not engaged in active work against the Soviet Union” 
was also, in the Centre’s view, obvious disinformation. 

Since the Five were double agents, it followed that 
those they had recruited to the NKVD were also plants. 
One example which particularly exercised the Centre was 
the case of Peter Smollett (ABO), who in 1941 had 
achieved the remarkable feat of becoming head of the 
Russian department in the wartime Ministry of 



Information. By 1943 Smollett was using his position to 
organize pro-Soviet propaganda on a prodigious scale. A 
vast meeting at the Albert Hall in February to celebrate 
the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Red Army included 
songs of praise by a massed choir, readings by John 
Gielgud and Laurence Olivier, and was attended by 
leading politicians from all parties. The film USSR at War 
was shown to factory audiences of one and a quarter 
million. In September 1943 alone, the Ministry of 
Information organized meetings on the Soviet Union for 
34 public venues, 35 factories, 100 voluntary societies, 28 
civil defense groups, 9 schools and a prison; the BBC in 
the same month broadcast thirty programs with a 
substantial Soviet content. Yet, because Smollett had 
been recruited by Philby, he was, in the eyes of the 
Centre, necessarily a plant. His apparently spectacular 
success in organizing pro- Soviet propaganda on an 
unprecedented scale was thus perversely interpreted as a 
cunning plot by British intelligence to hoodwink the 
NKVD.121 

Even the hardened conspiracy theorists of the Centre, 
however, had some difficulty in explaining why the Five 
were providing, along with disinformation, such large 
amounts of accurate high-grade intelligence. In its missive 
to the London residency of October 25, the Centre 
suggested a number of possible answers to this baffling 
problem. The sheer quantity of Foreign Office documents 
supplied by Maclean might indicate, it believed, that. 



unlike the other four, he was not consciously deceiving 
the NKVD, but was merely being manipulated by the 
others to the best of their ability. The Centre also argued 
that the Five were instructed to pass on important 
intelligence about Germany which did not harm British 
interests in order to make their disinformation about 
British policy more credible. 

The most valuable “documentary material about the 
work of the Germans” in 1943 was the German decrypts 
supplied by Caimcross from Bletchley Park. A brief 
official biography of Fitin published by the SVR singles 
out for special mention the ULTRA intelligence obtained 
from Britain on German preparations for the battle of 
Kursk when the Red Army halted Hitler’s last major 
offensive on the eastern front. The Luftwaffe decrypts 
provided by Caimcross were of cmcial importance in 
enabling the Red Air Force to launch massive pre-emptive 
strikes against German airfields which destroyed over 500 
enemy aircraft. 

The Centre’s addiction to conspiracy theory ran so 
deep, however, that it was capable of regarding the agent 
who supplied intelligence of critical importance before 
Kursk as part of an elaborate network of deception. It 
therefore ordered the London residency to create a new 
independent agent network uncontaminated by the Five. 
But, though the Five were “undoubtedly double agents,” 
the residency was ordered to maintain contact with them. 



The Centre gave three reasons for this apparently 
contradictory decision. First, if British intelligence 
realized that their grand deception involving the Five had 
been discovered, they might well intensify their search for 
the new network intended to replace them. Secondly, the 
Centre acknowledged that, despite the Five’s 
“unquestionable attempts to disinform us,” they were 
none the less providing “valuable material about the 
Germans and other matters.” Finally, “Not all the 
questions about this group of agents have been completely 
cleared up.” The Centre was, in other words, seriously 
confused about what exactly the Five were up to.^^^ 

To try to discover the exact nature of the British 
intelligence conspiracy, the Centre sent, for the first time 
ever, a special eight-man surveillance team to the London 
residency to trail the Five and other supposedly bogus 
Soviet agents in the hope of discovering their contacts 
with their non-existent British controllers. The same team 
also investigated visitors to the Soviet embassy, some of 
whom were suspected of being MI5 agents provocateurs. 
The new surveillance system was hilariously 
unsuccessful. None of the eight-man team spoke English; 
all wore conspicuously Russian clothes, were visibly ill at 
ease in English surroundings and must frequently have 
disconcerted those they followed. 

The absurdity of trailing the Five highlights the central 
weakness in the Soviet intelligence system. The Centre’s 
ability to collect intelligence from the West always 



comfortably exceeded its capacity to interpret what it 
collected. Moscow’s view of its British allies was 
invariably clouded by variable amounts of conspiracy 
theory. The Soviet leadership was to find it easier to 
replicate the first atomic bomb than to understand policy- 
making in London. 



EIGHT 


VICTORY 


Given the closeness of the British-American “special 
relationship,” the Centre inevitably suspected that some of 
the President’s advisers sympathized with Churchill’s 
supposed anti-Soviet plots. ^ Suspicions of Roosevelt 
himself, however, were never as intense as those of 
Churchill. Nor did the Centre form conspiracy theories 
about its American agents as preposterous as those about 
the Cambridge Five. Perhaps because the NKVD had 
penetrated the OSS from the moment of its foundation, it 
was less inclined to believe that United States intelligence 
was running a system of deception which compared with 
the supposed use of the Five by the British. The CPUS A’ s 
assistance in the operation to assassinate Trotsky, 
combined with the enthusiasm with which it “exposed and 
weeded out spies and traitors,”^ appeared to make its 
underground section a reliable recruiting ground. Vasili 
Zarubin’s regular contacts with the CPUS A leader, Earl 
Browder, plainly convinced him of the reliability of those 
covert Party members who agreed to provide secret 
intelligence. 



By the spring of 1943, however, the Centre was 
worried about the security of its large and expanding 
American agent network. Zarubin became increasingly 
incautious both in his meetings with Party leaders and in 
arranging for the payment to them of secret subsidies 
from Moscow. One of the files noted by Mitrokhin 
records censoriously, “Without the approval of the 
Central Committee, Zarubin crudely violated the rules of 
clandestinity.” On one occasion Browder asked Zarubin 
to deliver Soviet money personally to the Communist 
underground organization in Chicago; the implication in 
the KGB file is that he agreed. On another occasion, in 
April 1943, Zarubin traveled to California for a secret 
meeting with Steve Nelson, who ran a secret control 
commission to seek out informants and spies in the 
Californian branch of the Communist Party, but failed to 
find Nelson’s home. Only on a second visit did he 
succeed in delivering the money. On this occasion, 
however, the meeting was bugged by the FBI which had 
placed listening devices in Nelson’s home.^ The Soviet 
ambassador in Washington was told confidentially by 
none other than Roosevelt’s adviser, Harry Hopkins, that 
a member of his embassy had been detected passing 
money to a Communist in California.^ 

Though Zarubin became somewhat more discreet after 
this “friendly warning,” his cover had been blown. Worse 
was yet to come. Four months later Zarubin was secretly 
denounced to the FBI by Vasili Mironov, a senior officer 



in the New York residency who had earlier appealed 
unsuccessfully to the Centre for Zarubin’s recall.^ In an 
extraordinary anonymous letter to Hoover on August 7, 
1943, Mironov identified Zarubin and ten other leading 
members of residencies operating under diplomatic cover 
in the United States, himself included, as Soviet 
intelligence officers. He also revealed that Browder was 
closely involved with Soviet espionage and identified the 
Hollywood producer Boris Morros (FROST) as a Soviet 
agent. Mironov’s motives derived partly from personal 
loathing for Zarubin himself He told Hoover, speaking of 
himself in the third person, that Zarubin and Mironov 
“both hate each other.” Mironov also appears to have 
been tortured by a sense of guilt for his part in the 
NKVD’s massacre of the Polish officer corps in 1940. 
Zarubin, he told Hoover, “interrogated and shot Poles in 
Kozelsk, Mironov in Starobelsk.” (In reality, though 
Zarubin did interrogate some of the Polish officers, he 
does not appear to have been directly involved in their 
execution.) But there are also clear signs in Mironov’s 
letter, if not of mental illness, at least of the paranoid 
mindset generated by the Terror. He accused Zarubin of 
being a Japanese agent and his wife of working for 
Germany, and concluded bizarrely: “If you prove to 
Mironov that Z is working for the Germans and Japanese, 
he will immediately shoot him without a trial, as he too 
holds a very high post in the NKVD.”^ 

By the time Mironov’s extraordinary denunciation 



reached the FBI, Zarubin had moved from New York to 
Washington — a move probably prompted by the steady 
growth in intelligence of all kinds from within the 
Roosevelt administration. As the senior NKVD officer in 
the United States, Zarubin retained overall control in 
Washington of the New York and San Francisco 
residencies; responsibility for liaison with the head of the 
CPUS A, Browder, and with the head of the illegal 
residency, Akhmerov; and direct control of some of his 
favorite agents, among them the French politician Pierre 
Cot and the British intelligence officer Cedric Belfrage, 
whom he took over from Golos.^ 

With his cover blown, however, Zarubin found life in 
Washington difficult. One of his most humiliating 
moments came at a dinner for members of the Soviet 
embassy given early in 1944 by the governor of 
Louisiana, Sam Houston Jones. ^ After dinner, as guests 
wandered round the governor’s house in small groups, a 
lady who appeared to know that Zarubin was a senior 
NKGB officer, turned to him and said, “Have a seat. 
General!” Zarubin, whose fuse and sense of humor were 
both somewhat short, took the seat but replied stiffly, “I 
am not a general!” Another guest, who identified himself 
as an officer in military intelligence, complimented the 
lady on her inside knowledge. He then caused Zarubin 
further embarrassment by asking for his views on the 
massacre of 16,000 Polish officers, some of whose bodies 
had been exhumed in the Katyn woods. Zarubin replied 



that German allegations that the officers had been shot by 
the NKVD (as indeed they had) were a provocation 
intended to sow dissension within the Grand Alliance 
which would deceive only the naive. ^ 

Zarubin subsequently sought to persuade the Centre 
that his humiliating loss of cover was due not to his own 
indiscretion but to the fact that the Americans had 
somehow discovered that he had interrogated imprisoned 
Polish officers in Kozelsk. The Centre was unimpressed. 
In a letter to the Central Committee, the NKGB Personnel 
Directorate reported that his period as resident in the 
United States had been marked by a series of blunders. 
Mironov not long before had informed on Zarubin to 
Hoover, now appears to have written to Stalin, accusing 
Zarubin of being in contact with the FBI. ^ ^ In the summer 
of 1944, both Zarubin and Mironov were recalled to 
Moscow. Anatoli Gorsky, who until a few months earlier 
had been resident in London, succeeded Zarubin in 
Washington. 

Once back in Moscow, Zarubin quickly succeeded in 
reestablishing his position at the expense of Mironov and 
was appointed deputy chief of foreign intelligence. By the 
time he retired three years later, allegedly on grounds of 
ill health, he had succeeded in taking much of the credit 
for the remarkable wartime intelligence obtained from the 
United States, and was awarded two Orders of Lenin, two 
Orders of the Red Banner, one Order of the Red Star, and 



numerous medals. Mironov, by contrast, was sentenced 
soon after his return to Moscow to five years in a labor 
camp, probably for making false accusations against 
Zarubin. In 1945 he tried to smuggle out of prison to the 
US embassy in Moscow information about the NKVD 
massacre of Polish officers similar to that which, 
unknown to the Centre, he had sent to the FBI two years 
earlier. On this occasion Mironov was caught in the act, 
given a second trial and shot.^^ 

Even after the recall of Zarubin and Mironov, feuding 
and denunciations continued within the American 
residencies. As with Mironov’s bizarre accusations, some 
of the feuds had an almost surreal quality about them. In 
August 1944 the newly appointed resident in San 
Francisco, Grigori Pavlovich Kasparov, telegraphed to the 
Centre a bitter denunciation of the resident in Mexico 
City, Lev Tarasov, who, he claimed, had bungled attempts 
to liberate Trotsky’s assassin, Ramon Mercader, and had 
adopted a “grand lifestyle.” As well as renting a house 
with grounds and employing two servants in addition to 
the staff allocated to him, Tarasov was alleged to be 
spending too much time breeding parrots, poultry and 
other birds. The fate of Tarasov’s denounced parrots is 
not recorded. 

There was dissension too in New York, where the 
inexperienced 28-year-old Stepan Apresyan (MAY) had 
been appointed resident early in 1944, despite the fact that 



he had never previously been outside the Soviet Union. 
His appointment was bitterly resented by his much more 
experienced deputy, Roland Abbiate (alias “Vladimir 
Pravdin,” codenamed SERGEI), whose previous 
assignments had included the liquidation of the defector 
Ignace Poretsky. Operating under cover as the Tass 
bureau chief in New York, Abbiate had a grasp of 
American conditions which greatly exceeded Apresyan’s, 
but his career continued to be held back by the fact that, 
although he had been bom in St. Petersburg in 1902, his 
parents were French and had returned to France in 1920. 
Abbiate had returned with them, living in France until his 
recmitment by the OGPU as an illegal in 1932.^^ 

As a stop-gap measure to compensate for Apresyan’s 
now visible incompetence, the Centre gave Abbiate 
virtually equal status with Apresyan in the autumn of 
1944 in mnning the residency. Abbiate responded by 
telegraphing to Moscow a scathing attack on Apresyan, 
whom he condemned as “incapable of dealing with the 
tasks which are set him” or of gaining the respect of his 
staff: 


MAY [Apresyan] is utterly without the knack of 
dealing with people, frequently showing himself 
excessively abmpt and inclined to nag, and too rarely 
finding time to chat with them. Sometimes our 
operational workers ... cannot get an answer to an 
urgent question from him for several days at a time 



... A worker who has no experience of work abroad 
cannot cope on his own with the work of directing 
the TYRE OFFICE [New York residency]. 

The real responsibility, Abbiate clearly implied, rested 
with the Centre for appointing such an obviously 
unsuitable and unqualified resident. The civil war 
between the resident and his deputy continued for just 
over a year before ending in victory for Abbiate. In March 
1945 Apresyan was transferred to San Francisco, leaving 
Abbiate as resident in New York.^^ 

WHIFF THE WASHINGTON and New York residencies 
were both in some turmoil in the summer of 1944, sanity 
was returning to Fondon. The Magnificent Five were 
officially absolved of all suspicion of being double agents 
controlled by the British. On June 29 the Centre informed 
the Fondon residency, then headed by Konstantin 
Mikhailovich Kukin (codenamed IGOR),^^ that recent 
important SIS documents provided by Philby had been 
largely corroborated by material from “other sources” 
(some probably in the American OSS, with whom SIS 
exchanged many highly classified reports) “This is a 
serious confirmation of S[OHNCHEN]’s honesty in his 
work with us, which obliges us to review our attitude 
toward him and the entire group.” It was now clear, the 
Centre acknowledged, that intelligence from the Five was 



“of great value,” and contact with them must be 
maintained at all costs: 

On our behalf express much gratitude to 
S[OHNCHEN] for his work ... If you find it 
convenient and possible, offer S[OHNCHEN] in the 
most tactful way a bonus of 100 pounds or give him 
a gift of equal value. 

After six years in which his phenomenal work as a 
penetration agent had been frequently undervalued, 
ignored or suspected by the Centre, Philby was almost 
pathetically grateful for the long overdue recognition of 
his achievements. “During this decade of work,” he told 
Moscow, “I have never been so deeply touched as now 
with your gift and no less deeply excited by your 
communication [of thanks]. 

High among the intelligence which restored the 
Centre’s faith in Philby were his reports, beginning early 
in 1944, on the founding by SIS of a new Section IX “to 
study past records of Soviet and Communist activity.” 
Urged on by his new controller, Boris Krotenschield 
(alias Krotov, codenamed KRECHIN), Philby succeeded 
at the end of the year in becoming head of an expanded 
Section IX, with a remit for “the collection and 
interpretation of information concerning Soviet and 
Communist espionage and subversion in all parts of the 
world outside British territory.” As one of his SIS 



colleagues, Robert Cecil, wrote later, “Philby at one 
stroke had ... ensured that the whole post-war effort to 
counter Communist espionage would become known in 
the Kremlin. The history of espionage records few, if any, 
comparable masterstrokes.”^^ 

At about the same time that Philby was given his 
present, Caimcross was belatedly rewarded for his 
contribution to the epic Soviet victory at Kursk. 
Krotenschield informed him that he had been awarded 
one of the highest Soviet decorations, the Order of the 
Red Banner. He opened a velvet-lined box, took out the 
decoration and placed it in Caimcross ’s hands. 
Krotenschield reported to the Centre that Caimcross was 
visibly elated by the award, though he was told to hand it 
back for safekeeping in Moscow.^^ The award came too 
late, however, to achieve its full effect. In the summer of 
1943, exhausted by the strain of his regular car journeys 
to London to deliver ULTRA decrypts to Gorsky, and 
probably discouraged by Gorsky’s lack of appreciation, 
Caimcross had left Bletchley Park. Though he succeeded 
in obtaining a job in SIS, first in Section V 
(Counterintelligence), then in Section I (Political 
Intelligence), his importance in the Centre’s eyes now 
ranked clearly below that of Philby.^^ Unlike Philby, 
Caimcross did not get on well with his SIS colleagues. 
The head of Section I, David Footman, found him “an odd 
person, with a chip on his shoulder. 



Encouraged by the Centre’s new appreciation of their 
talents, the other members of the Five — Maclean, Burgess 
and Blunt — ^became even more productive than before. In 
the spring of 1944 Maclean was posted to the Washington 
embassy, where he was soon promoted to first secretary. 
His zeal was quickly apparent. According to one of his 
colleagues, “No task was too hard for him; no hours were 
too long. He gained the reputation of one who would 
always take over a tangled skein from a colleague who 
was sick, or going on leave, or simply less zealous.” The 
most sensitive, and in the NKGB’s view probably the 
most important, area of policy in which Maclean 
succeeded in becoming involved by early 1945 was 
Anglo-American collaboration in the building of the 
atomic bomb.^^ 

Burgess increased his usefulness to the NKGB by 
gaining a job in the Foreign Office press department soon 
after Maclean was posted to Washington. Claiming no 
doubt that he required access to a wide range of material 
to be adequately informed for press briefings, Burgess 
regularly filled a large holdall with Foreign Office 
documents, some of them highly classified, and took them 
to be photographed by the NKGB. The holdall, however, 
was almost his undoing. At a meeting with Krotenschield, 
Burgess was approached by a police patrol, who 
suspected that the bag contained stolen goods. Once 
reassured that the two men had no housebreaking 
equipment and that the holdall contained only papers, the 



patrol apologized and proceeded on its way. Though 
Burgess may subsequently have used a bag which less 
resembled that of a housebreaker, his productivity was 
unaffected. According to one of the files examined by 
Mitrokhin, of the Foreign Office documents provided by 
Burgess in the first six months of 1945, 389 were 
classified “top secret.”^^ 

Blunf s productivity was prodigious too. In addition to 
providing intelligence from MI5, he continued to run Leo 
Long in military intelligence, and in the crucial months 
before D-Day gained access to Supreme Headquarters 
Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF), not far from MI5 
headquarters.^^ Part of Blunt’s contribution to NKGB 
operations in London was to keep the residency informed 
of the nature and extent of MI5 surveillance. Intelligence 
which he provided in 1945 revealed that MI5 had 
discovered that his Cambridge contemporary, James 
Klugmann, was a Communist spy. In 1942 Klugmann had 
joined the Yugoslav section of SOE Cairo, where his 
intellect, charm and fluent Serbo-Croat gave him an 
influence entirely disproportionate to his relatively junior 
rank (which eventually rose to major). As well as briefing 
Allied officers about to be dropped into Yugoslavia, he 
also briefed the NKGB on British policy and secret 
operations. In both sets of briefings he sought to advance 
the interests of Tito’s Communist partisans over those of 
Mihailovich’s royalist Chetniks. For four months in 1945 
he served in Yugoslavia with the British military mission 



to Tito’s forces. Blunt was able to warn Krotenschield 
that MI5 listening devices in the British Communist Party 
headquarters in King Street, London, had recorded a 
conversation in which Klugmann boasted of secretly 
passing classified information to the Yugoslav 
Communists. 

WITH THE EXCEPTION of the Five, potentially the 
most important Soviet spy in Britain was the nuclear 
physicist Klaus Fuchs, recruited by the GRU late in 
1941.30 Fuchs left for the United States late in 1943 
as part of the British team chosen to take part in the 
MANHATTAN project, he was — though he did not 
realize it — transferred from GRU to NKGB control and 
given the codename REST (later changed to 
CHARLES).^ ^ Earlier in 1943, the Centre had instructed 
its residencies in Britain and the United States that “[t]he 
brain centers [scientific research establishments] must 
come within our jurisdiction.” Not for the first time, the 
GRU was forced to give way to the demands of its more 
powerful “neighbor.”^^ In 1944 Melita Norwood, the 
long-serving Soviet agent in the British Non-Ferrous 
Metals Association, ceased contact with SONYA of the 
GRU and was given an NKGB controller. In March 
1945, after her employer won a contract from the TUBE 
ALLOYS project, Norwood gained access to documents 
of atomic intelligence which the Centre described as 



“of great interest and a valuable contribution to the 
development of work in this field.” She was instructed to 
say nothing about her espionage work to her husband, and 
in particular to give no hint of her involvement in atomic 
intelligence.^^ Atomic intelligence from London and the 
American residencies was complementary as well as 
overlapping. According to Vladimir Barkovsky, head of 
S&T at the London residency, “In the USA we obtained 
information on how the bomb was made and in Britain of 
what it was made, so that together [intelligence from the 
two countries] covered the whole problem.”^^ 

On February 5, 1944 Fuchs had his first meeting in 
New York’s East Side with his NKGB controller, Harry 
Gold (codenamed successively GOOSE and ARNO), an 
industrial chemist bom in Switzerland of Russian 
parents. Fuchs was told to identify himself by carrying a 
tennis ball in his hand and to look for a man wearing one 
pair of gloves and carrying another. Gold, who 
introduced himself as “Raymond,” reported to Leonid 
Kvasnikov, head of S&T at the New York residency (later 
known as Line X), that Fuchs had “greeted him pleasantly 
but was rather cautious at first. Fuchs later claimed, 
after his arrest in 1949, that during their meetings “the 
attitude of ‘Raymond’ was at all times that of an inferior.” 
Gold admitted, after his own arrest by the FBI, that he 
was overawed by the extraordinary intelligence which 
Fuchs provided and had found the idea of an atomic bomb 



“so frightening that the only thing I could do was shove it 
away as far back in my mind as I could and simply not 
think on the matter at all.”^^ 

On July 25, 1944 the New York residency telegraphed 
the Centre: “Almost half a year of contact established 
with REST [Fuchs] has demonstrated the value of his 
work for us.” It asked permission to pay him a “reward” 
of 500 dollars. The Centre agreed, but, before the money 
could be handed over, Fuchs had disappeared.^^ It was 
over three months before Gold discovered that Fuchs had 
been posted to Fos Alamos, and he did not renew contact 
with him until Fuchs returned to the east coast on leave in 
February 1945.^^ 

During 1944 Kvasnikov’s responsibilities were 
extended: he was given the new post of S&T resident for 
the whole of the United States — a certain indication of the 
increasing priority of atomic espionage.^^ Fate in 1944 
Kvasnikov was able to inform the Centre that, in addition 
to Fuchs, there were now two more prospective spies at 
Fos Alamos. 

The first, David Greenglass, was recruited through a 
group of S&T agents run by Julius Rosenberg 
(codenamed successively ANTENNA and FIBERAF), a 
26-year-old New York Communist with a degree in 
electrical engineering. Fike Fuchs, the members of the 
Rosenberg ring, who included his wife Ethel, had been 
rewarded with cash bonuses in the summer. The ring was 



producing so many classified documents to be 
photographed in Kvasnikov’s apartment that the New 
York residency was running dangerously short of film. 
The residency reported that Rosenberg was receiving so 
much intelligence from his agents that he was finding it 
difficult to cope: “We are afraid of putting LIBERAL out 
of action with overwork. 

In November 1944 Kvasnikov informed the Centre that 
Ethel Rosenberg’s sister, Ruth Greenglass (codenamed 
WASP), had agreed to approach her husband, who 
worked as a machinist at Los Alamos. “I was young, 
stupid and immature,” said David Greenglass (codenamed 
BUMBLEBEE and CALIBRE) later, “but I was a good 
Communist.” Stalin and the Soviet leadership, he 
believed, were “really geniuses, every one of them:” 
“More power to the Soviet Union and abundant life for 
their peoples!” “My darling,” Greenglass wrote to his 
wife, “I most certainly will be glad to be part of the 
community project [espionage] that Julius and his friends 
[the Russians] have in mind.”^^ 

The New York residency also reported in November 
1944 that the precociously brilliant nineteen-year-old 
Harvard physicist Theodore Alvin (“Ted”) Hall, then 
working at Los Alamos, had indicated his willingness to 
collaborate. As well as being inspired by the myth-image 
of the Soviet worker-peasant state, which was an article of 
faith for most ideological Soviet agents. Hall convinced 



himself that an American nuclear monopoly would 
threaten the peace of the post-war world. Passing the 
secrets of the MANHATTAN project to Moscow was 
thus a way “to help the world,” as well as the Soviet 
Union. As the youngest of the atom spies, Hall was given 
the appropriate, if transparent, codename MLAD 
(“Young”). Though only one year older, the fellow 
Harvard student who first brought Hall into contact with 
the NKGB, Saville Savoy Sax, was codenamed STAR 
(“Old”).^^ Hall himself went on to become probably the 
youngest major spy of the twentieth century. 

THE PENETRATION OF Los Alamos was part of a more 
general surge in Soviet intelligence collection in the 
United States during the last two years of the war, as the 
NKGB’s agents, buoyed up by the remorseless advance of 
the Red Army towards Berlin and the opening of a second 
front, looked forward to a glorious victory over fascism. 
The number of rolls of microfilm sent by Akhmerov’s 
illegal residency to Moscow via New York grew from 
211 in 1943 to 600 in 1944 and 1,896 in 1945 The 
Centre, however, found it difficult to believe that 
espionage in the United States could really be as 
straightforward as it seemed. During 1944-5 the NKGB 
grew increasingly concerned about the security of its 
American operations and sought to bring them under 
more direct control.^^ Among its chief anxieties was 



Elizabeth Bentley’s habit of socializing with the agents 
for whom she acted as courier. When Bentley’s controller 
and lover, Jacob Golos, died from a sudden heart attack 
on Thanksgiving Day 1943, Akhmerov decided to 
dispense with a cut-out and act as her new controller. 
Bentley’s first impressions were of a smartly dressed 
“j aunty-looking man in his mid- thirties” with an 
expansive manner. (Akhmerov was actually fortytwo). 
She soon realized, however, that “despite the superficial 
appearance of a boulevardier, he was a tough character. 
For the next six months, though Bentley continued to act 
as courier for the Silvermaster group in Washington, she 
felt herself under increasing pressure. 

In March 1944 Earl Browder passed on to her another 
group of Washington bureaucrats who had been sending 
him intelligence which he had previously passed on to 
Golos. Bentley regarded Victor Perlo (RAIDER), a 
government statistician who provided intelligence on 
aircraft production, as the leader of the group — ^probably 
because he acted as spokesman during her first meeting 
with them.^^ Akhmerov, however, believed that the real 
organizer was Charles Kramer (LOT), a government 
economist, and was furious that the Perlo/Kramer network 
had been handed over by Browder not to him but to 
Bentley. For over a year, he told the Centre, Zarubin and 
he had wanted to make direct contact with the group, but 
Browder had failed to arrange it. “If we work with this 



group,” Akhmerov added, “it will be necessary to remove 
[Bentley]. 

Bentley appealed to Browder for support as she 
struggled to remain the courier for the Washington 
networks. “Night after night, after battling with 
[Akhmerov],” wrote Bentley later, “I would crawl home 
to bed, sometimes too weary to undress.” Eventually, 
Bentley agreed to arrange a meeting between Akhmerov 
and Silvermaster (PAL). Soon afterwards, according to 
Bentley, Akhmerov told her, “almost drooling with 
arrogance:” “Earl [Browder] has agreed to turn Greg 
[Silvermaster] over to me ... Go and ask him.” “Don’t be 
naive,” Browder told Bentley the next day. “You know 
that when the cards are down, I have to take my orders 
from them.”^^ Akhmerov reported to the Centre that 
Bentley had taken her removal from the Silvermaster 
group “very much to heart ... evidently supposing that we 
do not trust her. She is offended at RULE VO Y [Browder] 
for having consented to our liaison with PAL.”^^ 

Bentley was also removed from contact with the 
Perlo/Kramer group. Gorsky tried to placate her by 
inviting her to dinner at a waterfront restaurant in 
Washington. He made a bad start. “I hope the food is 
good,” he said. “Americans are such stupid people that 
even when it comes to a simple matter like cooking a 
meal, they do it very badly.” “Ah, yes,” he added, seeing 
Bentley’s expression change. “I had forgotten for the 



moment that you, too, are an American.” Gorsky went on 
to tell her that she had been awarded the Order of the Red 
Star (“one of the highest — reserved for all our best 
fighters”) and showed her a facsimile: “We all think 
you’ve done splendidly and have a great future before 
you.” GOOD GIRL was not to be placated.^^ A year later 
she secretly began telling her story to the FBI. 

The Centre was also worried by increased FBI 
surveillance of the New York Soviet consulate, which 
housed the legal residency, and by a warning from 
Duncan Lee (KOCH) in September 1944 that the OSS 
Security Division was compiling a list of Communists and 
Communist sympathizers in OSS.^^ The Centre’s 
nervousness was shared by some of its best agents. 
Bentley found Lee himself “on the verge of cracking up ... 
so hypercautious that he had taken to crawling around the 
floor of his apartment on hands and knees examining the 
telephone wires to see if they had been tampered with.”^^ 
Another highly placed Soviet agent, the senior Treasury 
official Harry Dexter White (JURIST), told his controller 
that, though he was unconcerned for his own personal 
security and his wife had prepared herself “for any self- 
sacrifice,” he would have to be very cautious because of 
the damage to the “new course” (the Soviet cause) which 
would occur if he were exposed as a spy. He therefore 
proposed that in the future they have relatively infrequent 
meetings, each lasting about half an hour, while driving 



around in his car.^^ 

There was a further alarm in November which, 
according to Bentley, followed an urgent warning from an 
agent in the White House, Roosevelt’s administrative 
assistant Lauchlin Currie. Currie reported that “the 
Americans were on the verge of breaking the Soviet 
code.”^^ The alarm appears to have subsided when it was 
discovered that Currie had wrongly concluded that a fire- 
damaged NKGB codebook obtained by OSS from the 
Finns would enable Soviet communications (which went 
through a further, theoretically impenetrable, 
encipherment by “one-time pad”) to be decrypted.^ ^ 
(Given the phenomenal success of Anglo-American 
codebreakers in breaking the highest grade German and 
Japanese ciphers, Currie’s mistake is understandable.) At 
Roosevelt’s insistence, Donovan returned the NKGB 
codebook to the Soviet embassy. A doubtless bemused 
Fitin sent Donovan his “sincere thanks. 

DESPITE ALL THE Centre’s anxiety that Soviet 
espionage was about to be exposed, and despite all the 
confusion in the residencies, the NKGB’s eager American 
and British agents continued to provide intelligence 
remarkable for both its quantity and quality. The NKGB 
proudly calculated after the war that the grand total of its 
wartime agents and informers (“confidential contacts”) 
around the world had been 1,240, who had provided 



41,718 items of intelligence. Approximately 3,000 foreign 
intelligence reports and documents had been judged 
important enough to be sent to the State Defense 
Committee and the Central Committee. Eighty-seven 
foreign intelligence officers were decorated for their 
wartime work.^^ 

Moscow made far better use of S&T than of its political 
intelligence, which was always likely to be ignored or 
regarded with suspicion when it disagreed with Stalin’s 
conspiracy theories — or with those of the Centre, which 
were closely modeled on his. S&T from the West, by 
contrast, was welcomed with open and unsuspicious arms 
by Soviet scientists and technologists. A. F. Ioffe, the 
director of the USSR Academy of Sciences Leningrad 
Physics and Technological Institute, wrote of wartime 
S&T: 

The information always turns out to be accurate and 
for the most part very complete ... I have not 
encountered a single false finding. Verification of all 
the formulae and experiments invariably confirms 
the data contained in the materials. 

The most valuable S&T concerned the atomic program. 
Kurchatov reported to Beria on September 29, 1944 that 
intelligence revealed the creation for the MANHATTAN 
project of “a concentration of scientific and engineering- 
technical power on a scale never before seen in the history 



of world science, which has already achieved the most 
priceless results. According to NKGB calculations, up 
to November 1944 it had acquired 1,167 documents on 
nuclear research, of which 88 from the United States and 
79 from Britain were judged of particular importance. 
The most important, however, were yet to come. 

On February 28, 1945 the NKGB submitted to Beria its 
first comprehensive report on atomic intelligence for two 
years — also the first to be based on reports from inside 
Los Alamos. Five months before the successful test of the 
first atomic bomb at Alamogordo in southern New 
Mexico, the Centre was informed of all the main elements 
in its construction. The information which Fuchs had 
passed to Gold on the east coast in mid-February arrived 
too late to be included in the Centre’s assessment. The 
report passed to Beria was, almost certainly, based chiefly 
on intelligence from the nineteen-year-old Theodore Hall 
and technical sergeant David Greenglass. There can be 
little doubt that Hall’s intelligence, delivered to the New 
York residency by his friend, Saville Sax, was the more 
important. It was probably Hall who first revealed the 
implosion method of detonating the bomb, though a more 
detailed report on implosion by Fuchs reached Kurchatov 
on April 6.^^ 

In the spring of 1945 Sax was replaced as courier 
between Hall and the New York residency by Leontina 
(“Lona”) Cohen, codenamed LESLIE. “Lona” had been 



recruited in 1941 by her husband Morris (codenamed 
LUIS), who had become a Soviet agent during the 
Spanish Civil War while serving in the International 
Brigades. The couple, later to figure among the heroes of 
Soviet intelligence, were collectively codenamed the 
DACHNIKI (“Vacationers”), but their careers as agents 
were interrupted by Morris’s conscription in 1942. 
“Lona” was reactivated early in 1945 to act as a courier to 
both Los Alamos and the Anglo-Canadian atomic 
research center at Chalk River, near Ottawa, which was 
also penetrated by Soviet agents. While she made contact 
with Hall, Gold acted as courier for Fuchs and 
Greenglass. Each of the three Soviet agents was 
completely ignorant of the espionage conducted by the 
other two.^^ 

It is probable that both Fuchs and Hall independently 
furnished the plans of the first atomic bomb, each of 
which the Centre was able to crosscheck against the 
other. Fuchs and Hall also independently reported that 
the test of the first atomic bomb had been fixed for July 
10, 1945,^^ though in the end weather conditions caused it 
to be postponed for six days. A month later the Pacific 
War was at an end. Following the bombing of Hiroshima 
and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, Japan surrendered. 

Lona Cohen spent the final dramatic weeks of the 
Pacific War in New Mexico, waiting for Hall to deliver 
the results of the Alamogordo test. After missing 



rendezvous in Albuquerque on three consecutive 
Sundays, Hall finally handed a set of highly classified 
papers to his courier, probably soon after the Japanese 
surrender.^ ^ On catching the train back to New York, 
Lona Cohen was horrified to see military police on board 
searching passengers’ luggage. With remarkable presence 
of mind she thrust Hall’s documents inside a newspaper 
and gave it to a policeman to hold while she opened her 
purse and suitcase for inspection. The policeman handed 
the newspaper back, inspected her purse and suitcase, and 
Mrs. Cohen returned safely to New York.^^ 

Thanks chiefly to Hall and Fuchs, the first Soviet 
atomic bomb, successfully tested just over four years 
later, was to be an exact copy of the Alamogordo bomb. 
At the time, however, the Centre found it difficult to 
believe that the theft of two copies of perhaps the most 
important secret plans in American history could possibly 
escape detection. The sheer scale of its success made the 
NKGB fear that the penetration of the MANHATTAN 
project would soon be uncovered by the Americans. 

The NKGB officer in charge of intelligence collected 
from Los Alamos in 1945 was Anatoli Antonovich 
Yatskov (alias “Yakovlev,” codenamed ALEKSEI), an 
engineer recruited by the NKVD in 1939 who succeeded 
Kvasnikov as S&T resident in the United States. He is 
nowadays remembered as one of the heroes of Russian 
foreign intelligence.^^ At the time, however, the Centre 



was bitterly critical of him. In July 1945 it concluded that 
his carelessness had probably compromised MLAD, and 
denounced his “completely unsatisfactory work with the 
agents on ENORMOZ [the MANHATTAN project].”^^ 
At the very moment of Soviet intelligence’s greatest ever 
triumph in the United States, the acquisition of the plans 
of the first atomic bomb, the Centre wrongly feared that 
the whole ENORMOZ operation was in jeopardy. 

The GRU, as well as the NKGB, had some striking 
successes in the wartime United States. Though Soviet 
military intelligence had been forced to surrender both 
Fuchs and the majority of its more important pre-war 
American agents to the more powerful NKGB, it had 
succeeded in retaining at least one of whom the Centre 
was envious in 1945. Gorsky reported to the Centre a 
conversation between Akhmerov and ALES (Alger Hiss), 
who had been working for the GRU for the past ten 
years. Though Hiss was a senior diplomat, Akhmerov 
said that the GRU had generally appeared little interested 
in State Department documents, and had asked Hiss and a 
small group of agents, “for the most part consisting of his 
relations,” to concentrate on military intelligence.^^ Late 
in 1944, however. Hiss’s role as a Soviet agent took on a 
new significance when he became actively engaged in 
preparations for the final meeting of the wartime Big 
Three at Yalta in the Crimea in February 1945. 

Yalta was to prove an even bigger success for Soviet 



intelligence than Tehran. This time both the British and 
the American delegations, housed respectively in the 
ornate Vorontsov and Livadia Palaces, were successfully 
bugged. The mostly female personnel used to record and 
transcribe their private conversations were selected and 
transported to the Crimea in great secrecy. Not till they 
arrived at Yalta did they discover the jobs that had been 
assigned to them.^^ The NKGB sought, with some 
success, to distract both delegations from its surveillance 
of them by lavish and attentive hospitality, personally 
supervised by a massive NKGB general, Sergei 
Nikiforovich Kruglov. When Churchill’s daughter, Sarah, 
casually mentioned that lemon went well with caviar, a 
lemon tree appeared, as if by magic, in the Vorontsov 
orangery. At the next Allied conference, in Potsdam, 
General Kruglov was rewarded with a KBE, thus 
becoming the only Soviet intelligence officer to receive 
an honorary knighthood. 

Stalin was even better informed about his allies at Yalta 
than he had been at Tehran. All of the Cambridge Five, no 
longer suspected of being double agents, provided a 
regular flow of classified intelligence or Foreign Office 
documents in the runup to the conference, though it is not 
possible to identify which of these documents were 
communicated to Stalin personally. Alger Hiss actually 
succeeded in becoming a member of the American 
delegation. The problem which occupied most of the time 
at Yalta was the future of Poland. Having already 



conceded Soviet dominance of Poland at Tehran, 
Roosevelt and Churchill made a belated attempt to secure 
the restoration of Polish parliamentary democracy and a 
guarantee of free elections. Both were outnegotiated by 
Stalin, assisted once again by a detailed knowledge of the 
cards in their hands. He knew, for example, what 
importance his allies attached to allowing some 
“democratic” politicians into the puppet Polish 
provisional government already established by the 
Russians. On this point, after initial resistance, Stalin 
graciously conceded, knowing that the “democrats” could 
subsequently be excluded. After first playing for time, 
Stalin gave way on other secondary issues, having first 
underlined their importance, in order to preserve his 
allies’ consent to the reality of a Soviet-dominated 
Poland. Watching Stalin in action at Yalta, the permanent 
under- secretary at the Foreign Office, Sir Alexander 
Cadogan, thought him in a different league as a negotiator 
to Churchill and Roosevelt: “He is a great man, and 
shows up very impressively against the background of the 
other two aging statesmen.” Roosevelt, in rapidly failing 
health and with only two months to live, struck Cadogan, 
by contrast, as “very woolly and wobbly. 

Roosevelt and Churchill left Yalta with no sense that 
they had been deceived about Stalin’s true intentions. 
Even Churchill, hitherto more skeptical than Roosevelt, 
wrote confidently, “Poor Neville Chamberlain believed he 
could trust Hitler. He was wrong. But I don’t think I’m 



wrong about Stalin.”^^ Some sense of how Moscow felt 
that good intelligence had contributed to Stalin’s success 
at Yalta is conveyed by Moscow’s congratulations to 
Hiss. Gorsky reported to the Centre in March 1945, after a 
meeting between Akhmerov and Hiss: 

Recently ALES [Hiss] and his whole group were 
awarded Soviet decorations. After the Yalta 
conference, when he had gone on to Moscow, a 
Soviet personage in a very responsible position 
(ALES gave to understand that it was Comrade 
Vyshinsky [Deputy Foreign Minister]) allegedly got 
in touch with ALES and at the behest of the military 
NEIGHBOURS [GRU] passed on to him their 
gratitude and so on.^^ 

The NKGB’s regret at failing to wrest Hiss from the 
NEIGHBOURS must surely have intensified in April 
when he was appointed acting Secretary-General of the 
United Nations “organizing conference” at San 
Francisco. 

BEHIND THE VICTORIOUS Red Army as it swept into 
central Europe during the final months of the war came 
detachments of Smersh (short for Smert Shpionam, 
“Death to Spies!”), a military counter-intelligence agency 
detached from the NKVD in 1943 and placed directly 
under the control of Stalin as Chairman of the State 



Defense Committee and Defense Commissar.^^ Smersh’s 
main mission was to hunt for traitors and Soviet citizens 
who had collaborated with the enemy. On Stalin’s 
instructions, it cast its net remarkably wide, screening 
well over five million people. The million or more Soviet 
POWs who had survived the horrors of German prison 
camps were treated as presumed deserters and transported 
to the gulag, where many died. 

In their anxiety to honor obligations to their ally, both 
the British and American governments collaborated in a 
sometimes barbarous repatriation. So far as Britain was 
concerned, the most controversial part of the forced 
repatriation was the hand-over of Cossacks and 
“dissident” Yugoslavs from south Austria to the Red 
Army and Tito’s forces respectively in May and June 
1945. Most had collaborated with the enemy, though 
sometimes only to a nominal degree. On June 1 battle- 
hardened soldiers of the 8th Argylls, some of them in 
tears, were ordered to break up a Cossack religious 
service and drive several thousands of unarmed men, 
women and children into cattle trucks with rifle butts and 
pick handles. There were similar horrors on succeeding 
days. Some of the Cossacks killed themselves and their 
families to save them from torture, execution or the gulag. 
Most of the 45,000 repatriated Cossacks were Soviet 
citizens, whom Churchill and Roosevelt had agreed at 
Yalta to return to the Soviet Union. But a minority, 
variously estimated at between 3,000 and 10,000 were so- 



called “old emigres” who had left Russia after the civil 
war, had never been citizens of the Soviet Union, and 
were not covered by the Yalta agreement. They too were 
repatriated against their will.^^ 

Among the “old emigres” were a group of White 
generals — chief among them Pyotr Krasnov, Andrei 
Shkuro and Sultan Kelech Ghirey^^ — whom the NKGB 
and its predecessors had been pursuing for a quarter of a 
century. A Smersh detachment was sent to Austria with 
orders to track them down. Its initial inquiries to the 
British about their whereabouts met with no response 
other than the claim that no information was available. 
After heavy drinking at a dinner for Anglo-Russian 
troops, however, a British soldier blurted out that, until 
recently, the generals had been at a camp in the village of 
Gleisdorf.^^ A group of Smersh officers drove 
immediately to Gleisdorf where they discovered that, 
though the generals had left, Shkuro ’s mistress Yelena 
(surname unknown) was still there. Yelena was lured out 
of the camp on the pretense that she had a visitor. As she 
approached the Smersh car, she suddenly saw the Russian 
officers inside and froze with fear. She was quickly 
bundled into the car and revealed, under no doubt brutal 
interrogation, that the White generals had appealed for the 
Supreme Allied Commander, Field Marshal Alexander, 
for protection. Yelena also disclosed that the generals had 
with them fourteen kilograms of gold.^^ What happened 



next is of such importance that Mitrokhin’s note on it 
deserves to be quoted as fully as possible: 

The Chekists [Smersh officers] raised the matter of 
the generals again at a meeting with ... [a British] 
lieutenant-colonel. They mentioned where the 
generals were. The Chekists proposed that they 
should approach the question of the generals’ fate in 
a business-like way. “What do you mean by that?” 
asked the Englishman. They explained to him. If the 
British would hand them over quietly at the same 
time as the Cossacks were repatriated, they could 
keep the generals’ gold. “If the old men remain with 
you, you and your colleagues will get no benefit at 
all. If you accept our alternative, you will get the 
gold.” The lieutenant-colonel thought a while and 
then agreed. He talked with two of his colleagues 
about the details of the operation. On the pretext that 
they were being taken to Alexander’s headquarters 
for talks, the generals were put into cars without any 
of their belongings and driven to Odenburg 
[Judenburg] where they were handed over to the 
Chekists. From the hands of Smersh they were 
transferred to Moscow, to the Calvary of the 
Lubyanka.^^ 

No corroboration is available from any other source for 
the claim in a KGB file that a British army officer (and 



perhaps two of his colleagues) had been bribed into 
handing over the White generals. Given the failure on the 
ground to distinguish the minority of non- Soviet Cossacks 
from the rest, they might well have been surrendered to 
Smersh in any case. The generals would probably have 
survived, however, if their petitions had reached Field 
Marshal Alexander, who might well have granted them. 
But the petitions mysteriously disappeared en route. 

The speed and injustice of the “repatriation” derived 
chiefly from the desire of military commanders on the 
spot to be rid of an unwelcome problem as soon as 
possible, combined with the belief that individual 
screening to determine which Cossacks were not of Soviet 
nationality would be a complex, long drawn out, and in 
some cases impossible task. On May 21 Brigadier Toby 
Low of 5 Corps, which was in charge of the 
“repatriation,” issued an order defining who were to be 
regarded as Soviet citizens. The one White Russian group 
which could be collectively identified as non- Soviet, the 
Schutzkorps, commanded by Colonel Anatol Rogozhin, 
was, he instructed, not to be repatriated. But those to be 
“treated as Soviet Nationals” included the “Ataman 
Group” (of which General Krasnov was a leading 
member) and the “Units of Lt.-Gen. Shkuro.” Low added 
that “[ijndividual cases [appeals] will NOT be considered 
unless particularly pressed,” and that “[i]n all cases of 
doubt, the individual will be treated as a Soviet 
National. 



When all allowance is made for the difficulties of 
combining loyalty to allies with respect for the human 
rights of the Cossacks, the brutality with which the 
repatriation was conducted remains perhaps the most 
ignominious episode in twentieth-century British military 
history. “I reproach myself for just one thing,” the 76- 
year-old White general Krasnov later told the NKGB. 
“Why did I trust the British?” On May 27, just before 3 
A.M., a time of day much favored by Soviet Security, 
General Shkuro was awakened by an unidentified British 
officer, who told him he was under arrest and took him to 
be held under close guard well away from the Cossack 
camp. Another, or perhaps the same, British officer later 
delivered an “urgent,” though bogus, invitation to General 
Krasnov to a conference with Field Marshal Alexander, 
his former comrade-in-arms during the Russian civil war. 
Smersh photographers were waiting to record the historic 
moment when the NKGB’s oldest enemies were turned 
over to it.^^ For the British army it was a shameful 
moment. For Stalin, Smersh and the NKGB, it was a 
famous victory. 



NINE 


FROM WAR TO COLD WAR 


At the end of the Second World War, the Centre faced 
what it feared was impending disaster in intelligence 
operations against its wartime allies. The first major alarm 
occurred in Ottawa, where relations among NKGB and 
GRU personnel working under “legal” cover in the Soviet 
embassy were as fraught as in New York. The situation 
was worst in the GRU residency.^ On the evening of 
September 5, 1945 Igor Gouzenko, a GRU cipher clerk at 
the Soviet embassy in Ottawa, secretly stuffed more than 
a hundred classified documents under his shirt and 
attempted to defect. He tried hard to hold his stomach in 
as he walked out of the embassy. “Otherwise,” his wife 
said later, “he would have looked pregnant.” 

Defection turned out to be more difficult than 
Gouzenko had imagined. When he sought help at the 
offices of the Ministry of Justice and the Ottawa Journal, 
he was told to come back the next day. But on September 
6 both the Ministry of Justice and the Ottawa Journal, 
which failed to realize it was being offered the spy story 
of the decade, showed no more interest than on the 



previous evening. By the night of September 6 the Soviet 
embassy realized that both Gouzenko and classified 
documents were missing. While Gouzenko hid with his 
wife and child in a neighbor’s flat, NKGB men broke 
down his door and searched his apartment. It was almost 
midnight before the local police came to his rescue and 
the Gouzenko family at last found sanctuary.^ 

As well as identifying a major GRU spy ring, 
Gouzenko also provided fragmentary intelligence on 
NKGB operations. Some months later Lavrenti Beria, the 
Soviet security supremo, circulated to residencies a 
stinging indictment of the incompetence of the GRU and, 
he implied, the NKGB in Ottawa: 

The most elementary principles of security were 
ignored, complacency and self-satisfaction went 
unchecked. All this was the result of a decline in 
political vigilance and sense of responsibility for 
work entrusted by the Party and the government. 
G[ouzenko]’s defection has caused great damage to 
our country and has, in particular, very greatly 
complicated our work in the American countries.^ 

The fear of being accused of further breaches of security 
made the Ottawa residency unwilling to take any initiative 
in recruiting new agents. According to a later damage 
assessment, Gouzenko’s defection “paralyzed intelligence 
work [in Canada] for several years and continued to have 



a most negative effect on the work of the residency right 
up to 1960.” In the summer of 1949 the acting resident in 
Ottawa, Vladimir Trofimovich Burdin (also known as 
Borodin), newly arrived from Moscow, wrote to the 
Centre to complain about his colleagues’ inertia: 

The residency not merely lost all its previous 
contacts in Canadian circles but did not even try to 
acquire new ones ... The Soviet colony closed in on 
itself and shut itself off from the outside world, 
becoming wholly preoccupied with its own internal 
affairs. 

The Centre agreed. The residency, it concluded, had “got 
stuck in a rut.”^ 

For the rest of Gouzenko’s life the KGB tried 
intermittently and unsuccessfully to track him down. In 
1975, after a Progressive Conservative MP, Thomas 
Cossit, requested a review of Gouzenko’s pension, the 
Ottawa residency deduced that Gouzenko lived in his 
constituency. The residency also reported that Cossit and 
Gouzenko had been seen together at an ice hockey match 
during a visit to Canada by the Soviet national team. A 
KGB officer stationed in Ottawa, Mikhail Nikolayevich 
Khvatov, sought to cultivate Cossit in the hope of 
discovering Gouzenko’s whereabouts. He had no success 
and the residency subsequently reported that 
parliamentary questions by Cossit were “clearly anti- 



Soviet in tone.” Some years later the KGB began to 
search for compromising material on Cossit’s private life 
and prepare active measures to discredit him. He died in 
1982 before the campaign against him had begun. ^ 

Gouzenko’s defection in September 1945 also caused 
alarm at NKGB residencies in Britain and the United 
States. As head of SIS Section IX (Soviet Counter- 
intelligence) Philby was kept well informed of the 
debriefing of Gouzenko and reported “an intensification 
of counter-measures” against Soviet espionage in London. 
The Centre responded with instructions for tight security 
procedures to ensure that “the valuable agent network is 
protected from compromise.” Boris Krotenschield (aka 
“Krotov”), the controller of the residency’s most 
important agents, was told to hand over all but Philby to 
other case officers and to reduce the frequency of 
meetings to once a month: “Warn all our comrades to 
make a thorough check when going out to a meeting and, 
if surveillance is observed, not to attempt under any 
circumstances to evade the surveillance and meet the 
agent ...” If necessary, contact with British agents was to 
be temporarily broken off.^ 

Even greater alarm was caused by the attempted 
defection of an NKGB officer in Turkey, Konstantin 
Dmitry evich Volkov. On August 27, 1945 Volkov wrote 
to the British vice-consul in Istanbul, C. H. Page, 
requesting an urgent appointment. When Page failed to 
reply, Volkov turned up in person on September 4 and 



asked for political asylum for himself and his wife. In 
return for asylum and the sum of 50,000 pounds (about a 
million pounds at today’s values), he offered important 
files and information obtained while working on the 
British desk in the Centre. Among the most highly rated 
Soviet agents, he revealed, were two in the Foreign Office 
(doubtless Burgess and Maclean) and seven “inside the 
British intelligence system,” including one “fulfilling the 
function of head of a section of British counter-espionage 
in London” (almost certainly Philby).^ 

On September 19 Philby was startled to receive a report 
of Volkov’s meeting with Page by diplomatic bag from 
the Istanbul consulate.^ He quickly warned Krotenschield. 
^ On September 21 the Turkish consulate in Moscow 
issued visas for two NKGB hatchet men posing as 
diplomatic couriers. The next day Philby succeeded in 
gaining authorization from the chief of SIS, Sir Stewart 
Menzies, to fly to Turkey to deal personally with the 
Volkov case. Due to various travel delays he did not 
arrive in Istanbul until September 26. Two days earlier 
Volkov and his wife, both on stretchers and heavily 
sedated, had been carried on board a Soviet aircraft bound 
for Moscow. During the flight back to London Philby 
drafted a cynical report to Menzies on the possible 
reasons for Volkov’s detection by the NKGB. As he 
wrote later. 



Doubtless both his office and his living quarters were 
bugged. Both he and his wife were reported to be 
nervous. Perhaps his manner had given him away; 
perhaps he had got drunk and talked too much; 
perhaps even he had changed his mind and confessed 
to his colleagues. Of course, I admitted, this was all 
speculation; the truth might never be known. 

Another theory — that the Russians had been tipped 
off about Volkov’s approach to the British — had no 
solid evidence to support it. It was not worth 
including in my report. ^ ^ 

Under interrogation in Moscow before his execution, 
Volkov admitted that he had asked the British for political 
asylum and 50,000 pounds, and confessed that he had 
planned to reveal the names of no fewer than 314 Soviet 
agents. Philby had had the narrowest of escapes. With 
slightly less luck in Ottawa a few weeks earlier, 
Gouzenko would not have been able to defect. With 
slightly more luck in Istanbul, Volkov would have 
succeeded in unmasking Philby and disrupting the MGB’s 
British operations. 

The Gouzenko and Volkov alarms occurred at a 
remarkably busy period for the London residency, headed 
until 1947 by Konstantin Kukin (codenamed IGOR). 
From September 11 to October 2, 1945 the Council of 
Foreign Ministers of the five permanent members of the 
UN Security Council (the United States, Soviet Union, 



Britain, France and China) held its first meeting in 
London to discuss peace treaties with defeated enemy 
states and other post-war problems. The residency’s 
penetration of the Foreign Office gave it an unusually 
important role. Throughout the meeting, according to 
KGB files, the Soviet ambassador, Ivan Maisky, placed 
greater reliance on residency staff than on his own 
diplomats, forcing them to extend each working day into 
the early hours of the following morning. The Security 
Council meeting, however, was a failure, publicly 
exposing for the first time the deep East- West divisions 
which by 1947 were to engender the Cold War. 

At this and subsequent meetings of the Security 
Council, Stalin’s foreign minister, Vyacheslav 
Mikhailovich Molotov, depended heavily on the 
intelligence supplied by the MGB’s Western agents. 
Indeed, he tended to take it for granted. “Why,” he roared 
on one occasion, “are there no documents?” At the 
London conference which opened in November 1947, he 
appears to have received some Foreign Office documents 
even before they reached the British delegation. 

The MGB’s most important sources during the 
meetings of the Council of Foreign Ministers from 1945 
to 1949 were British. Thanks to the kidnapping of 
Volkov, four of the wartime Magnificent Five were able 
to carry on work as full-time Soviet agents after the war. 
The exception was Anthony Blunt, who was under such 
visible strain that the Centre did not object to his decision 



to leave MI5. Shortly before he returned to the art world 
in November 1945 as Surveyor of the King’s Pictures, 
Blunt made one extraordinary outburst which at the time 
was not taken seriously. “Well,” he told his MI5 
colleague Colonel “Tar” Robertson, “it’s given me great 
pleasure to pass on the names of every MI5 officer to the 
Russians!” The Centre may well have hoped that Leo 
Long (codenamed ELLI), whom Blunt had run as a sub- 
agent in military intelligence during the war, would 
succeed him in the Security Service. Blunt recommended 
Long for a senior post in MI5 but the selection board 
passed him over, allegedly by a narrow margin, in favor 
of another candidate. Long moved instead to the British 
Control Commission in Germany, where he eventually 
became Deputy Director of Intelligence. There he resisted 
attempts to put him in regular contact with a case officer 
— a recalcitrance which the Centre attributed in part to the 
fact that Blunt had ceased to be his controller. Among the 
occasional services which Blunt continued to perform for 
the Centre were two or three visits to Germany to seek 
intelligence from Long.^^ 

Unlike Blunt, three of the Magnificent Five — Philby, 
Burgess and Maclean — were all at their peak as Soviet 
agents, and Caimcross still close to his, when the Cold 
War began. Philby remained head of SIS Section IX until 
1947, when he was appointed head of station in Turkey, a 
position which enabled him to betray agents who crossed 
the Russian border as well as their families and contacts 



inside the Soviet Union. Maclean established a reputation 
as a high-flying young diplomat in the Washington 
embassy, where he remained until 1947. In 1946 Burgess, 
who had joined the Foreign Office in 1944, became 
personal assistant to Hector McNeil, Minister of State to 
Ernest Bevin in the post-war Labor government. After 
the war John Caimcross returned to the Treasury, where 
the London residency renewed contact with him in 
1948.^^ Caimcross ’s main job at the Treasury over the 
next few years was to authorize expenditure on defense 
research. According to his Treasury colleague G. A. 
Robinson: 

[Caimcross] thus knew not just about atomic 
weapons developments but also plans for guided 
missiles, microbiological, chemical, underwater and 
all other types of weapons. He also needed to know, 
inter alia, about projected spending on aeronautical 
and radar research and anti-submarine detection, 
research by the Post Office and other bodies into 
signals intelligence, eavesdropping techniques, etc. 
He ... could legitimately ask for any further details 
thought necessary to give Treasury approval to the 
spending of money. 

Caimcross ’s controller, Yuri Modin, was, unsurprisingly, 
“overjoyed by the quality of [his] information.”^^ 

The new security procedures introduced in the wake of 



the Gouzenko and Volkov alarms made controlling the 
London residency’s agents far more laborious and 
timeconsuming than during or before the war. On 
average, before every meeting with an agent, each case 
officer spent five hours moving on foot or by public 
transport (especially the London Underground) between 
locations he had studied previously in order to engage in 
repeated checks that he was not under surveillance. Once 
at the meeting place, both the case officer and the agent 
were required to establish visual contact and to satisfy 
themselves that the other was not being watched before 
they approached each other. If either had any doubts, they 
would fall back on one of three previously agreed 
alternative rendezvous. The system pioneered in London 
was later introduced into other residencies.^^ 

The London residency also pioneered the use of radio 
intercept units to identify and monitor surveillance of its 
operations by the police and MI5. In addition to the main 
interception unit in the residency, mobile units were 
established in embassy cars to check the areas in which 
meetings took place with agents.^ ^ However, the Centre’s 
experiment with the eight-man surveillance team sent to 
London during the Second World War to carry out checks 
on agents and visitors to the Soviet embassy, as well as to 
discover the surveillance methods used by British 
intelligence, was discontinued. A report in KGB archives 
records that, handicapped by its lack of fluency in 



English, the team had “no major successes. The 
experiment was probably a total failure. 

The London residency’s attempts to enforce the 
strictest standards of secrecy and security had only a 
limited effect on Guy Burgess. On one occasion, while 
coming out of a pub where he had established visual 
contact with his case officer, he dropped his briefcase and 
scattered secret Foreign Office papers over the floor. 
There were frequent complaints that he turned up for 
meetings the worse for drink and with his clothing in 
disarray. When George Carey-Foster, head of the 
embryonic security branch in the Foreign Office, first 
encountered Burgess in 1947, he was struck by his 
“disheveled and unshaven appearance. He also smelt so 
strongly of drink that I enquired who he was and what his 
job was.” Yet Burgess could still display fragments of the 
charm and brilliance of his Cambridge years. Late in 
1947, probably to get rid of him. Hector McNeil 
recommended Burgess to the parliamentary under- 
secretary at the Foreign Office, Christopher Mayhew, 
who was then organizing the Information Research 
Department (IRD) to counter Soviet “psychological 
warfare.” Mayhew made what he later described as “an 
extraordinary mistake:” “I interviewed Burgess. He 
certainly showed a dazzling insight into Communist 
methods of subversion and I readily took him on.” 
Burgess went the rounds of British embassies selling 
IRD’s wares while simultaneously compromising the new 



department by reporting all its plans to Yuri Ivanovich 
Modin, who became his case officer in 1947 and acquired 
a reputation as one of the ablest agent controllers in 
Soviet intelligence. The chorus of protests at Burgess’s 
undiplomatic behavior led to his removal from the IRD 
and transfer to the Foreign Office Far Eastern Department 
in the autumn of 1948.^^ Though it disturbed the Centre, 
Burgess’s frequently outrageous conduct paradoxically 
strengthened his cover. Even to most of those whom he 
outraged he seemed as unlike a Soviet spy as it was 
possible to imagine. 

Modin was also concerned about Nikolai Borisovich 
Rodin (alias “Korovin”), who succeeded Kukin as 
London resident in 1947. Rodin considered himself above 
the tight security regulations on which he insisted for the 
other members of the residency. According to Modin, 
who loathed him personally, Rodin was “known to go to 
clandestine meetings in one of the embassy cars, and 
sometimes was foolhardy enough to place direct calls to 
agents in their offices.” But, in the rigidly hierarchical 
world of Soviet intelligence, Modin felt that “there was 
nothing I could do about it. It was hardly my place to 
denounce my superior in the service.” As head of Faculty 
Number One (Political Intelligence) in the FCD 
Andropov Institute in the early 1980s, Modin was less 
inhibited. He dismissed Rodin as an arrogant, pretentious 
nonentity.^^ 



THOUGH THE MGB’S most important British agents 
were still undetected at the end of the 1940s, many of 
their American counterparts had been compromised. The 
Centre had complained as early as March 1945 that the 
membership of the Silvermaster spy ring was an open 
secret among “many” Washington Communists and that 
Harry Dexter White’s Soviet “connection” had also 
become known. It denounced “not only the falling off in 
the [New York] Residency’s work of controlling and 
educating probationers [agents], but also the lack of 
understanding by our operational workers of the most 
elementary rules in our work.”^^ 

The defections later in 1945 of Igor Gouzenko and 
Elizabeth Bentley confirmed the Centre’s worst fears. In 
September J. Edgar Hoover reported to the White House 
and the State Department that Gouzenko had provided 
information on the activities of a number of Soviet spies 
in the United States, one of whom was “an assistant to the 
Secretary of State” (almost certainly Alger Hiss). On 
November 7 Bentley, who had first contacted the FBI six 
weeks earlier, began revealing what she knew of Soviet 
espionage to its New York field office. Next day Hoover 
sent President Truman’s military aide a first list of 
fourteen of those identified by Bentley as supplying 
information to “the Soviet espionage system:” among 
them Assistant Secretary of the Treasury Harry Dexter 
White, OSS executive assistant Duncan C. Lee and 
Roosevelt’s former aide Lauchlin Currie.^^ Bentley’s 



defection, in turn, revived FBI interest in Whittaker 
Chambers’ earlier evidence of pre-war Soviet espionage 
by Hiss, White and others. 

On November 20 Gorsky, the Washington resident 
whom Bentley knew as “Al,” met her for the last time in 
front of Bickford’s cafeteria on 23rd Street and Sixth 
Avenue in New York. Unaware that they were under 
surveillance by the FBI, Gorsky arranged their next 
meeting for January 20. According to Bentley, he told her 
that she might soon be needed “back in undercover 
work.” By the time the date for their next rendezvous had 
arrived, however, Gorsky was back in Moscow.^^ His 
hasty departure was probably due to the discovery of 
Bentley’s defection.^^ A few months later the resident in 
New York, Roland Abbiate (alias “Pravdin”), whose wife 
was known to Bentley, was also withdrawn.^ ^ A damage 
assessment in the Centre concluded that Bentley did not 
know the real name, address or telephone number of her 
previous controller, Iskhak Akhmerov, the illegal resident 
in the United States. As a precaution, however, he and his 
wife were recalled to Moscow.^^ 

The almost simultaneous recall of Gorsky, Abbiate and 
Akhmerov left the MGB without experienced leadership 
in the United States. There were few senior officers at the 
Centre with first-hand knowledge of North America 
capable of succeeding them. In any case, as Yuri Modin 
later acknowledged, “We were leery of sending people 



out of the Soviet Union for fear of defections. Most of our 
officers worked in Moscow, with the result that the few 
men posted in foreign countries had a workload so 
crushing that many of them cracked under the pressure. 
Akhmerov was not replaced as illegal resident until 

1948. ^^ Gorsky’s two successors as chief legal resident in 
the United States both became bywords for incompetence 
in the Centre. Grigori Grigory evich Dolbin, who arrived 
to replace Gorsky in 1946, had to be replaced in 1948 
after showing signs of insanity (due, it was rumored in 
Moscow, to the onset of hereditary syphilis). His 
successor, Georgi Aleksandrovich Sokolov, was 
reprimanded by the Centre before being recalled in 

1949 . ^^ 

The most effective damage limitation measure taken by 
the MGB after Bentley’s defection was to break off 
contact with most of the wartime American agents whose 
identities were known to her. As a result, Bentley’s many 
leads resulted in not a single prosecution. The FBI began 
its investigations too late to catch any of the spies named 
by Bentley in the act of passing on classified information, 
and it was unable to use evidence from wiretaps in court. 
The Centre, however, failed to grasp the extent of the 
legal obstacles which confronted the FBI and continued to 
fear for several years that it would succeed in mounting a 
major spy trial. 

The Centre’s fears were strengthened by a major 



American codebreaking success, later codenamed 
VENONA. For its high-grade diplomatic and intelligence 
communications the Soviet Union had used since 1927 a 
virtually unbreakable cipher system known in the West as 
the “one-time pad.”^^ During and immediately after the 
Second World War, however, some of the one-time pads 
were reissued, thus becoming vulnerable — though it took 
several years for American and British codebreakers to 
exploit the difficult opportunity offered to them by Soviet 
cryptographic carelessness. Late in 1946 Meredith 
Gardner, a brilliant cryptanalyst in the US Army Security 
[SIGINT] Agency, began decrypting some of the wartime 
messages exchanged between the Centre and its American 
residencies. By the summer of 1947 he had accumulated 
evidence from the decrypts of massive Soviet espionage 
in the wartime United States. In 1948 ASA called in the 
FBI. From October special agent Robert Lamphere began 
full-time work on VENONA, seeking to identify the 
agents (some still active) whose codenames appeared in 
the VENONA decrypts. Remarkably, however, the 
Central Intelligence Agency was not informed of 
VENONA until late in 1952.^^ Even more remarkably. 
President Truman appears not to have been told of the 
decrypts, perhaps for fear that he might mention them to 
the Director of Central Intelligence, head of the CIA, at 
one of his weekly meetings with him. VENONA showed 
in graphic detail how OSS, the CIA’s wartime 



predecessor, had been heavily penetrated by Soviet 
agents. Both Hoover and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff, General Omar N. Bradley, seem to have 
suspected — wrongly — that the same was true of the 
Agency.^^ 

The Centre learned the VENONA secret in 1947 — five 
years earlier than the CIA — from an agent in ASA, 
William Weisband (codenamed ZHORA).^^ The son of 
Russian immigrants to the United States, Weisband was 
employed as a Russian linguist and roamed around ASA 
on the pretext of looking for projects where his linguistic 
skills could be of assistance. Meredith Gardner recalls 
Weisband looking over his shoulder at a critical moment 
in the project late in 1946, just as he was producing one of 
the first important decrypts — an NKGB telegram of 
December 2, 1944 which revealed Soviet penetration of 
Los Alamos.^^ 

For the Centre, VENONA represented a series of 
unpredictable timebombs which threatened to explode 
over the next few years. It had no means of knowing 
precisely what NKGB telegrams would be decrypted in 
whole or part, or which Soviet agents would be 
compromised by them. Moscow’s anxieties were 
heightened by the public controversy which broke out in 
the United States in the summer of 1948 over Soviet 
espionage. In July 1948 Elizabeth Bentley gave evidence 
in public for the first time to the House Committee on Un- 



American Activities and achieved instant media celebrity 
as the “Red Spy Queen.” In evidence to the committee in 
early August, Whittaker Chambers identified Hiss, White 
and others as members of a secret pre-war Communist 
underground. The Centre wrongly feared that the 
committee hearings would be the prelude to a series of 
show trials which would expose its wartime espionage 
network. 

DURING THE LATE 1940s Soviet foreign intelligence 
operations were further confused by a major 
reorganization in Moscow, prompted by the American 
National Security Act of July 1947 which established a 
Central Intelligence Agency “for the purpose of 
coordinating the intelligence activities of the several 
government departments and agencies in the interest of 
national security.” Though that coordination was never 
fiilly achieved, Molotov argued that the unified foreign 
intelligence apparatus envisaged by the National Security 
Act would give the United States a clear advantage over 
the fragmented Soviet system. The solution, he argued, 
was to combine the foreign intelligence directorates of 
both the MGB and the GRU under a single roof. 
Molotov’s proposal had the further advantage, from 
Stalin’s viewpoint, of weakening the power of Beria, 
whose protege, Viktor Semyonovich Abakumov, headed 
the MGB.^^ In October 1947 the foreign intelligence 
directorates of the MGB and GRU were combined to 



form a new unified foreign intelligence agency, the 
Committee of Information (Komitet Informatsii or 
Under the new, highly centralized system, even the 
operational plans for arranging meetings with, and 
investigating the reliability of, important agents required 
the prior approval of the KI.^^ 

The appointment of Molotov as first chairman of the 
Committee of Information gave the Foreign Ministry 
greater influence on foreign intelligence operations than 
ever before. The first deputy chairman, responsible to 
Molotov for day-to-day operations, was the relatively 
pliant Pyotr Vasilyevich Fedotov, who had become the 
MGB foreign intelligence chief in the previous year.^^ 
Like most of the Centre management, Fedotov had almost 
no experience of the West. Roland Abbiate, the former 
resident in New York and probably the senior intelligence 
officer best acquainted with the West, was sacked on the 
formation of the KI. His file records that he was given no 
explanation for his dismissal and that “it was a terrible 
blow for him.” Though the reason for the sacking is not 
recorded, it may well have been related to his foreign 
Jewish ancestry, which is duly noted in his file. Abbiate 
was briefly reinstated after Stalin’s death, then sacked 
again and later committed suicide. 

Molotov sought to strengthen Foreign Ministry control 
of KI operations by appointing Soviet ambassadors in 
major capitals as “chief legal residents” with authority 



over both civilian (ex-MGB) and military (ex-GRU) 
residents. In the jaundiced view of the later KGB defector 
Ilya Dzhirkvelov: 

This resulted in incredible confusion. The residents, 
the professional intelligence officers, resorted to 
incredible subterfuges to avoid informing their 
ambassadors about their work, since the diplomats 
had only amateurish knowledge of intelligence work 
and its methods ...^^ 

Some diplomats, however, became directly involved in 
intelligence operations. After the troubles in the 
Washington residency which led to the recall of two 
successive residents in 1948-9, the Soviet ambassador, 
Aleksandr Semyonovich Panyushkin, took personal 
charge for a year. He acquired such a taste for intelligence 
that he later became head of the KGB First (foreign 
intelligence) Chief Directorate.^^ 

In 1949 Molotov, now out of favor with Stalin, was 
succeeded as both Foreign Minister and chairman of the 
KI by his former deputy, Andrei Vyshinsky, who had 
made his reputation as the brutal prosecutor in the prewar 
show trials. Vyshinsky retained a sycophantic devotion to 
Beria which showed itself even on the telephone. 
According to one of his successors, Andrei Gromyko, “As 
soon as he heard Beria’ s voice Vyshinsky leapt 
respectfully out of his chair. The conversation itself also 



presented an unusual picture: Vyshinsky cringed like a 
servant before his master. Unlike Molotov, Vyshinsky 
had little interest in KI affairs, handing over the 
chairmanship after a few months to Deputy Foreign 
Minister Valerian Zorin. Fedotov was succeeded as first 
deputy chairman in charge of day-to-day operations by 
the more brutal and decisive Sergei Romanovich 
Savchenko, like Vyshinsky a protege of Beria. Savchenko 
seems to have answered to Beria rather than the Foreign 
Ministry. 

By the time Vyshinsky succeeded Molotov, much of 
the Committee of Information had unraveled. In the 
summer of 1948, after a prolonged dispute with Molotov, 
Marshal Nikolai Aleksandrovich Bulganin, Minister for 
the Armed Forces, began withdrawing military 
intelligence personnel from KI control and returning them 
to the GRU. Probably with the support of Beria, 
Abakumov then embarked on a long drawn out struggle to 
recover control of the remnants of the KI. At the end of 
1948 all residency officers in the EM (Russian emigre) 
and SK (Soviet colonies abroad) Lines returned to the 
MGB. The KI was finally wound up and the rest of its 
foreign intelligence responsibilities returned to the MGB 
late in 1951.^^ 

THE MAIN LEGACY of the KI period to the subsequent 
development of Soviet intelligence was a renewed 



emphasis on illegals who, it was believed, would 
eventually establish a more secure and better-concealed 
foundation for foreign intelligence operations than the 
legal residencies, particularly in the United States. The 
Fourth (Illegals) Directorate of the KI, formed by 
combining the illegals sections of the MGB and the GRU, 
had a total staff of eighty-seven, headed by Aleksandr 
Mikhailovich Korotkov, who had made his reputation 
during pre-war missions to assassinate “enemies of the 
people” on foreign soil. In 1949, by which time military 
personnel in the directorate had returned to the GRU, 
forty-nine illegals were in training. Korotkov set up 
departments specializing in the selection of illegals, their 
training and the fabrication of documentation to support 
their legends. By 1952 the documentation department had 
forged or doctored 364 foreign identity documents, 
including seventy-eight passports. Illegal support (Line 
N) officers were sent by the Centre to all major legal 
residencies.^^ 

The first priority of the Fourth Directorate was the 
creation of a new illegal residency in New York to rebuild 
its American intelligence operations. The man selected as 
illegal resident, the first since Akhmerov’s departure from 
the United States at the beginning of 1946, was Vilyam 
(“Willie”) Genrikhovich Fisher, codenamed MARK, 
probably the only English-bom Soviet intelligence 
officer. Fisher’s parents were Russian revolutionaries of 



the Tsarist era who had emigrated in 1901 to 
Newcastleon-Tyne, where Vilyam had been bom in 
1903.^^ In 1921 the family returned to Moscow, where 
Fisher became a Comintern translator. During military 
service in 1925-6, he was trained as a radio operator and, 
after a brief period in the Fourth Department (Military 
Intelligence), was recmited by INO (OGPU foreign 
intelligence) in 1927. He served as a radio operator in 
residencies in Norway, Turkey, Britain and France until 
1936, when he was appointed head of a training school 
for radio operators in illegal residencies.^^ 

Fisher was fortunate not to be shot during the Great 
Terror. His file records that, as well as being 
automatically suspect because of his English background, 
he had been “referred to in positive terms” by a series of 
“enemies of the people,” and his wife’s brother was 
accused of being a Trotskyite. Though dismissed by the 
NKVD at the end of 1938, he survived to be reemployed 
during the Great Patriotic War in a unit training radio 
operators for guerrilla and intelligence operations behind 
German lines. 

Fisher’s training as an illegal began in 1946 under the 
personal supervision of Korotkov, the head of the MGB 
Illegals Department. His legend was unusually 
complicated. Fisher assumed one identity during his 
journey to the United States in 1948 and another shortly 
after his arrival. The first identity was that of Andrei 



Yurgesovich Kayotis, a Lithuanian bom in 1895 who had 
emigrated to the United States and become an American 
citizen. In November 1947 Kayotis crossed the Atlantic to 
visit relatives in Europe. While he was in Denmark, the 
Soviet embassy issued a travel document enabling him to 
visit Russia and retained his passport for use by Fisher. In 
October 1948 Fisher traveled to Warsaw on a Soviet 
passport, then traveled on Kayotis ’s passport via 
Czechoslovakia and Switzerland to Paris, where he 
purchased a transatlantic ticket on the SS Scythia. On 
November 6 he set sail from Le Havre to Quebec, traveled 
on to Montreal and — still using Kayotis ’s passport — 
crossed into the United States on November 17.^^ 

On November 26 Fisher had a secret meeting in New 
York with the celebrated Soviet illegal I. R. Grigulevich 
(codenamed MAKS), who had taken part in the first 
attempt to assassinate Trotsky in Mexico City and had led 
a Latin American sabotage group during the war attacking 
ships and cargoes bound for Germany. Grigulevich gave 
Fisher 1,000 dollars and three documents in the name of 
Emil Robert Goldfus: a genuine birth certificate, a draft 
card forged by the Centre and a tax certificate (also 
forged). Fisher handed back Kayotis ’s documents and 
became Goldfus. The real Goldfus, bom in New York on 
August 2, 1902, had died at the age of only fourteen 
months. Fisher’s file records that his birth certificate had 
been obtained by the NKVD in Spain at the end of the 
Spanish Civil War, at a time when it was collecting 



identity documents from members of the International 
Brigades for use in illegal operations, but gives no other 
details of its provenance. According to the legend 
constructed by the Centre, Goldfus was the son of a 
German house painter in New York, had spent his 
childhood at 120 East 87th Street, left school in 1916 and 
worked in Detroit until 1926. After further periods in 
Grand Rapids, Detroit and Chicago, the legendary 
Goldfus had returned to New York in 1947. The legend, 
however, was far from perfect. The Centre instructed 
Fisher not to seek employment for fear that his employer 
would make inquiries which would blow his cover. 
Instead, he was told to open an artist’s studio and claim to 
be self-employed.^^ As Fisher mingled with other New 
York artists, his technique gradually improved and he 
became a competent, if rather conventional, painter. He 
surprised friends in the artistic community with his 
admiration for the late nineteenth-century Russian painter 
Fevitan, of whom they had never heard, but made no 
mention of Stalinist “socialist realism,” with which he 
was probably also in sympathy. Fisher made no secret of 
his dislike for abstract painting. “You know,” he told 
another artist, “I think most contemporary art is headed 
down a blind alley. 

In 1949, as the basis of his illegal residency, Fisher was 
given control of a group of agents headed by Morris 
Cohen (codenamed FUIS and VOFUNTEER), which 



included his wife Lona (LESLE).^^ Following Elizabeth 
Bentley’s defection, the Centre had temporarily broken 
contact with the Cohens early in 1946, but renewed 
contact with them in Paris a year later and reactivated 
them in the United States in 1948.^^ The most important 
agent in the VOLUNTEER network was the physicist Ted 
Hall (MEAD), for whom Lona Cohen had acted as courier 
in 1945 when he was passing atomic intelligence from 
Los Alamos. Early in 1948, Hall, then working for his 
PhD at Chicago University, had joined the Communist 
Party together with his wife Joan, apparently with the 
intention of abandoning work as a Soviet agent and 
working for the campaign of the Progressive candidate, 
the naively pro- Soviet Henry Wallace, in the presidential 
election. Morris Cohen, however, persuaded Hall to 
return to espionage. On August 2, 1948 the Washington 
residency telegraphed the Centre: 

LUIS has met MEAD. He has persuaded him to 
break contact with the Progressive organization and 
concentrate on science. Important information 
obtained on MLAD’s two new contacts. They have 
declared their wish to transmit data on ENORMOZ 
[the nuclear program], subject to two conditions: 
MEAD must be their only contact and their names 
must not be known to officers of ARTEMIS [Soviet 
intelligence].^^ 



The VOLUNTEER network expanded to include, in 
addition to MEAD, three other agents: ADEN, SERB and 
SILVER. Two of these were undoubtedly the two 
nuclear physicists contacted by Hall. Though their 
identities remain unknown, the Centre clearly regarded 
their intelligence as of the first importance. According to 
an SVR history, “the Volunteer group ... were able to 
guarantee the transmittal to the Centre of supersecret 
information concerning the development of the American 
atomic bomb.”^^ 

In recognition of the VOLUNTEER group’s success, 
Fisher was awarded the Order of Red Banner in August 
1949 69 ^ however, his illegal residency was 

disrupted by the arrest of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, for 
whom Lona Cohen had acted as courier. Both the Cohens 
were quickly withdrawn to Mexico, where they were 
sheltered for several months by the Soviet agents OREL 
(“Eagle”) and FISH — ^both members of the Spanish 
Communist Party in exile^^ — ^before moving on to 
Moscow. The Cohens were to resurface a few years later, 
under the names Peter and Helen Kroger, as members of a 
new illegal residency in Britain. Hall’s career as a 
Soviet spy was also interrupted. In March 1951 he was 
questioned by an FBI team which was convinced that he 
was guilty of espionage but lacked the evidence for a 
prosecution. 



Under his later alias “Rudolf Abel,” Fisher was to 
become one of the best-known of all Soviet illegals, 
whose career was publicized by the KGB as a prime 
example of the success and sophistication of its operations 
in the West during the Cold War. In reality, Fisher never 
came close to rivaling the achievements of his wartime 
predecessor, Iskhak Akhmerov. During eight years as 
illegal resident, he appears never to have identified, let 
alone recruited, a single promising potential agent to 
replace the VOLUNTEER network. Unlike Akhmerov, 
however, he did not have the active and enthusiastic 
assistance of a well-organized American Communist 
Party (CPUS A) to act as talent-spotters and assistants. 
Part of the reason for Fisher’s lack of success was the 
post-war decline and persecution of the CPUSA.^^ 

THE MOST IMPORTANT American agent recruited 
during the early Cold War, Aleksandr (“Sasha”) 
Grigoryevich Kopatzky, was a walk-in. Kopatzky had 
been bom in the city of Surozh in Bryansk Oblast in 
1923,^^ and had served as a lieutenant in Soviet 
intelligence from August 1941 until he was wounded and 
captured by the Germans in December 1943. While in a 
German hospital he agreed to work for German 
intelligence. During the last two months of the war he 
served as an intelligence officer in General Andrei 
Vlasov’s anti-Soviet Russian Army of Liberation which 



fought the Red Army in alliance with the Wehrmacht. At 
the end of the war, Kopatzky was briefly imprisoned by 
the American authorities in the former concentration 
camp at Dachau.^^ 

Despite his service in the NKVD, Kopatzky’ s anti- 
Soviet credentials seemed so well established that he was 
invited to join the American-supervised German 
intelligence service established in 1946 at Pullach, near 
Munich, by General Reinhard Gehlen, the former 
Wehrmacht intelligence chief on the eastern front In 
1948 Kopatzky further distanced himself from his Soviet 
past by marrying the daughter of a former SS officer, 
Eleonore Stimer, who had been briefly imprisoned for her 
activities in the Hitler Youth. Eleonore later recalled that 
her husband “drank a lot of vodka. He kissed ladies’ 
hands ... He was very punctual, shined his shoes, did his 
gymnastics in the morning, had a neat haircut, short hair 
all his life. And he was a very good shot. Sasha liked to 
hunt and talked of hunting tigers in Siberia with his 
father.” Many years later, after Sasha’s death, it suddenly 
occurred to Eleonore, while watching a televised 
adaptation of a John Le Carre novel, that her husband 
might have married her to improve his cover. That 
realization, she says, “came like a mountain of bricks on 
me.”^^ By their wedding day Kopatzky was probably 
already planning to renew contact with Soviet 
intelligence. 



The SVR still regards the Kopatzky case as extremely 
sensitive. It insisted as recently as 1997 that no file exists 
which suggests that Kopatzky, under any of his aliases, 
ever engaged in “collaboration ... with Soviet 
intelligence.”^^ Mitrokhin, however, was able to take 
detailed notes from the bulky file which the SVR claims 
does not exist. The file reveals that in 1949 Kopatzky 
visited the Soviet military mission in Baden-Baden, and 
was secretly transported to East Berlin where he agreed to 
become a Soviet agent.^^ Soon afterwards, he infiltrated 
the anti-Soviet emigre organization Union of the Struggle 
for Liberation of the Peoples of Russia (SBONR), based 
in Munich, which had close links with the CIA. In 1951, 
doubtless to his Soviet controllers’ delight, he was 
recruited by the CIA station in West Berlin as “principal 
agent. Successively codenamed ERWIN, HERBERT 
and RICHARD by the Centre, Kopatzky received a 
monthly salary of 500 marks in addition to his income 
from the CIA. Among his earliest successes was, on 
November 5, 1951, to get one of his fellow CIA agents, 
the Estonian Vladimir Kivi (wrongly described in 
Kopatzky’ s file as an “American intelligence chief’), 
drunk, transport him to East Berlin and hand him over to 
Soviet intelligence.^^ Though Kopatzky was not a CIA 
staff officer and never worked at Agency headquarters, he 
did enormous damage to Agency operations in Germany 
for more than a decade. According to his file, no fewer 



than twenty-three KGB legal operational officers and one 
illegal “met and worked with him” — a certain indication 
of how highly the Centre rated him.^^ 

THROUGHOUT THE COLD WAR, Soviet intelligence 
regarded the United States as its “main adversary.” In 
second place at the beginning of the Cold War was the 
United States ’s closest ally, the United Kingdom. In third 
position came France. Before the Second World War, 
France had been a major base for NKVD foreign 
operations. Her crushing defeat in June 1940, however, 
followed by the German occupation of northern France, 
the establishment of the collaborationist Vichy regime in 
the south (later also occupied by the Germans) and 
Hitler’s invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941 
drastically reduced the scope for Soviet penetration. The 
NKGB did, however, establish a strong presence within 
Communist sections of the French Resistance. 

There were two main groups of Soviet agents in 
wartime France: one in Paris of about fifty Communists 
and fellow travelers headed by LEMOINE (transliterated 
into the Cyrillic alphabet as LEMON YE), and another of 
over twenty- five headed by HENRI, based on Toulouse, 
with, from 1941, a subgroup in Paris. According to KGB 
records, the LEMOINE group, most of whom believed 
they were working for the Communist Party rather than 
the NKGB, “was disbanded because of treachery.” 
Though six members of the HENRI group (KLOD, 



LUCIEN, MORIS, ROBERT and ZHANETTA) were 
caught and shot by the Germans, the core of the group 
survived. 

At the end of the war Soviet intelligence had much 
greater freedom of action in France than in either the 
United States or Britain. The Parti Communiste Frangais 
(PCF) publicly congratulated itself on its undeniably 
heroic role in the wartime Resistance, proudly termed 
itself le parti des fusilles (“the party of the shot”), and 
greatly inflated the numbers of its fallen heroes. From 
August 1944, when General de Gaulle invited the PCF to 
join the Provisional Government, there were Communist 
ministers for the first time in French history. According to 
an opinion poll in May 1945, 57 percent of the population 
thought that the defeat of Germany was due principally to 
the Soviet Union (20 percent gave the most credit to the 
United States, 12 percent to Britain). In the elections of 
October 1945 the PCF, with 26 percent of the vote, 
emerged as the largest party in France. By the end of the 
year it had almost 800,000 members. Though support for 
the PCF had almost peaked, there were many who hoped 
— or feared, particularly after de Gaulle’s resignation 
early in 1946 — that France was on the road to becoming a 
Communist-controlled “people’s democracy.” One 
socialist minister privately complained, “How many 
senior civil servants, even at the very top, are backing 
Communism to win!”^^ 

The Centre’s first instructions to the newly re- 



established Paris residency after the Liberation, dated 
November 18, 1944, instructed it to profit from the 
“current favorable situation” to renew contact with the 
pre-war agent network and recruit new agents in the 
foreign and interior ministries, intelligence agencies and 
political parties and organizations. Inspired by the success 
of scientific and technological intelligence-gathering in 
Britain and the United States, the Centre sent further 
instructions on February 20, 1945, ordering the residency 
to extend its recruitment to the Pasteur and Curie 
Institutes and other leading research bodies. The 
appointment of the ardent Communist and Nobel Laureate 
Frederic Joliot-Curie as the French govemmenf s Director 
of Scientific Research doubtless delighted the Centre. 
Joliot-Curie assured Moscow that “French scientists ... 
will always be at your disposal without asking for any 
information in return. 

During 1945 the Paris residency sent 1,123 reports to 
Moscow, based on intelligence from seventy sources. Its 
operational problems derived not from any lack of agents 
but from a shortage of controllers. Up to February 1945 
the residency had only three operational officers. In 
May MARCEL of the wartime HENRI group was 
instructed to set up a new group to assist in the 
penetration of the post-war foreign and domestic 
intelligence agencies, the foreign ministry and the 
political parties, and in re-establishing control over agents 



in the provinces.^ ^ By November the number of 
operational officers in the Paris residency had increased to 
seven, supported by six technical staff, but there was to be 
no further increase for several years. In addition to 
recruiting new agents, the residency was ordered to check 
individually every agent recruited before the war. 
Unsurprisingly, its 1945 reports were criticized for lack of 
depth and insufficient attention to the most valuable 
agents.^^ 

The next available statistics on the intelligence supplied 
by the Paris residency cover the period from July 1, 1946 
to June 30, 1947, when it supplied 2,627 reports and 
documents, well over double the total for 1945. It also had 
some major recruiting successes. In 1944 WEST, 
recruited by HENRI from the Resistance in the previous 
year, joined the newly founded foreign intelligence 
agency the DGER (from January 1946 the Service de 
Documentation Exterieure et de Contre Espionnage 
(SDECE)), working first on the British, then the Italian, 
desk. His file records that he provided “valuable 
information on the French, Italian and British intelligence 
services.” Though WEST (later renamed RANGE) was 
dismissed in 1945 and moved to a career in publishing, he 
retained contact with some of his former colleagues. 
RATYEN, the first of his recruits to be identified in the 
files noted by Mitrokhin, was dismissed from SDECE in 
1946. In 1947 WEST recruited two, more important 
SDECE officers, codenamed CHOU AN (or TORMA) and 



NOR (or NORMAN) .93 

Soviet penetration was assisted by the chronic 
infighting within SDECE. In May 1946 Andre Dewavrin 
(alias “Passy”), de Gaulle’s wartime intelligence chief and 
the first head of SDECE, was arrested on a charge of 
embezzlement of which he was later found innocent. 
For the next few years Dewavrin’ s successor, Henri 
Ribiere, and his deputy, Pierre Fourcaud, were engaged in 
such bitter feuding that Fourcaud was forced to deny 
accusations that he had sabotaged the brakes of Ribiere ’s 
car and caused a near fatal accident. On one occasion, 
during the fractious daily meeting of SDECE division 
heads, Ribiere drove his deputy out of the room with his 
walking stick. As one SDECE officer complained, 
“[DJivision heads, finding themselves with conflicting 
orders from their director and his deputy, did not know 
what to do.”^^ 

In the year up to June 30, 1947, the Paris residency 
forwarded to the Centre 1,147 documents on the French 
intelligence services, 92 on French intelligence operations 
against the Soviet Union and 50 on other intelligence 
agencies. The files noted by Mitrokhin record that both 
CHOUAN and NOR worked on political intelligence 
(SDECE Section d’ etudes politiques). CHOUAN was 
employed for a time in the American department of 
SDECE, but by 1949 was working on Soviet Bloc affairs. 
NOR specialized in intelligence on Italy.^^ WEST was 



paid 30,000 francs a month by the Paris residency, and in 
1957 was given 360,000 francs to buy a flat.^^ Ivan 
Ivanovich Agayants, the Paris resident from 1946 to 1948, 
was fond of boasting of his success in penetrating 
SDECE. In a lecture at the Centre in 1952 he sneeringly 
described French intelligence as “that prostitute I put in 
my pocket. 

Penetration of the Foreign Ministry at the Quai d’Orsay 
proved more difficult. During a visit to Moscow in June 
1946, the Communist trade union leader Benoit Frachon 
reported pessimistically: 

The officials of the Foreign Ministry represent a very 
closed caste ... well known for their reactionary 
views. Our situation at the ministry is very 
precarious. We have only one Party member. This is 
the private secretary of [Georges] Bidault [the 
Foreign Minister], who knows that she is Communist 
— so we do not have total confidence in her. Among 
the diplomats in foreign postings, only the embassy 
secretary in Prague is Communist. 

The Communist embassy secretary was almost certainly 

r 

Etienne Manac’h, who went on to become French 
ambassador in Beijing (1969-75).^^^ Manac’h, 
codenamed TAKSIM, had first made contact with Soviet 
intelligence while stationed in Turkey in 1942. His KGB 
file describes him as a confidential contact rather than an 



agent, who provided information from time to time “on an 
ideological-political basis” until 1971. His information 
was clearly valued by the Centre. During his twenty-nine 
years’ contact with the KGB he had six case officers, the 
last of whom — M. S. Tsimbal — ^was head of the FCD 
Fifth Department, whose responsibilities included 
operations in France. 

The KGB’s most important Cold War agents in the 
Foreign Ministry were cipher personnel rather than 
diplomats. Ultimately the most valuable and longest- 
serving agent recruited by the Paris embassy at the end of 
the war was probably a 23 -year-old cipher officer in the 
Quai d’Orsay codenamed JOUR (transliterated into the 
Cyrillic alphabet as ZHUR). The large amount of Foreign 
Ministry documents and cipher materials provided by 
JOUR were despatched from Paris to Moscow in what his 
file describes as “a special container,” and enabled much 
of the cipher traffic between the Quai d’Orsay and French 
embassies abroad to be decrypted. In 1957 he was secretly 
awarded the Order of the Red Star. JOUR was still active 
a quarter of a century later, and in 1982 was awarded the 
Order of the Friendship of Peoples for his “long and 
fruitful co-operation. 

The dismissal of Communist ministers from the French 
government in May 1947 made further Soviet penetration 
of the official bureaucracy more difficult. The Centre 
complained in April 1948 that: the residency had no 
agents close to the leadership of the Gaullist 



Rass emblement du Peuple Frangais, the Christian 
Democrat MRP and other “reactionary” political parties; 
it had failed to penetrate the Soviet section of SDECE; 
intelligence on the British and American embassies was 
poor; and inadequate progress had been made in 
penetrating the Commissariat on Atomic Energy and 
other major targets for scientific and technological 
intelligence. 

A plan was drawn up to remedy these failings and to 
promote active measures “to compromise people hostile 
to the USSR and the French Communist Party.” Once 
again, Moscow was not fully satisfied with the results 
achieved. In the five-month period from September 1 to 
February 1, 1949, the Paris residency submitted 923 
reports, of which 20 percent were judged sufficiently 
important to pass on to the Central Committee. The 
Centre noted, however, that “the requirement set by the 
leadership with regard to political intelligence had still not 
been adequately met.” During the eleven months from 
February 1 to December 31 the residency supplied 1,567 
reports. Though 21 percent were passed to the Central 
Committee, the reports were criticized for failing to 
“reveal the innermost aspects of events” and for “not 
making it possible to identify the plans of ruling circles in 
their struggle with democratic [pro-Soviet] forces. 

The decline in the number of reports to the Centre 
during 1949 — about forty a month fewer than during the 
latter months of 1948 — ^was due chiefly to what the files 



describe as a “deterioration in the operational situation” at 
the beginning of the year, caused by heightened 
surveillance by the internal security service, the Direction 
de la Surveillance du Territoire (DST), and the Surete. On 
March 12, 1949 the Centre warned the Paris residency of 
the danger of continuing to meet agents on the street or in 
cafes and restaurants and advised it to make much greater 
use of dead letter-boxes, messages in invisible ink and 
radio communication. The residency was also instructed 
to train its agents to recognize and evade surveillance, and 
to instruct them on how to behave if questioned or 
arrested. A month later the residency reported to the 
Centre that, though it was impracticable to abandon 
completely street meetings with agents, security had been 
much improved. Case officers were now forbidden to go 
directly from the embassy or any other Soviet premises to 
meet an agent. Before each meeting the officer was 
picked up by a residency driver at a pre-arranged location 
and driven to the area of the rendezvous, after elaborate 
security checks designed to detect surveillance. Following 
the meeting the case officer would pass on any materials 
supplied by the agent to another residency officer in a 
“brush contacf’ as they walked past each other. Both 
times and places of meetings with agents were regularly 
changed, and more rendezvous were arranged in 
churches, theaters, exhibitions and locations outside 
Paris. 

As a further security precaution, the frequency of 



meetings with agents was also reduced. The six most 
valuable were seen twice a month, ten other agents were 
met once a month and another seven once every two 
months. Less important agents were either put on ice or 
contacted by pre-arranged signals only as the need arose. 
After a year operating the new security procedures, the 
Paris residency reported that operating conditions had 
improved. On April 22, 1950 it informed the Centre that it 
was in contact with almost fifty agents — twice as many as 
a year before. For most of the next decade the 
residency was to provide better intelligence than its 
counterparts in Britain and the United States. 

THE ORGANIZATIONAL CONFUSION of Soviet 
foreign intelligence in the late 1940s was reflected in the 
running of its three most productive British agents. 
Remarkably, even Kim Philby had no regular controller 
during his term as head of station in Turkey from 1947 to 
1949. Except during visits to London, he communicated 
with Soviet intelligence via Guy Burgess. Burgess’s 
behavior, however, was becoming increasingly erratic. To 
his controller, Yuri Modin, it seemed “that his nerve was 
going, and that he could no longer take the strain of his 
double life.”^^^ A trip by Burgess to Gibraltar and Tangier 
in the autumn of 1949 turned into what Goronwy Rees 
called a “wild odyssey of indiscretions”: among them 
failing to pay his hotel bills, publicly identifying British 



intelligence officers and dmnkenly singing in local bars, 
“Little boys are cheap today, cheaper than yesterday.” 
Burgess was surprised not to be sacked on his return to 
London. Once back in the Foreign Office, however, he 
resumed his career as a dedicated Soviet agent, supplying 
large quantities of classified papers. On December 7, 
1949, for example, he handed Modin 168 documents, 
totaling 660 pages. KGB files also credit Burgess with 
using Anglo-American policy differences over the 
People’s Republic of China, established in October 1949, 
to cause friction in the “Special Relationship.”^ 

Donald Maclean was under even greater strain than 
Burgess. His posting to Cairo in October 1948 as 
counselor and head of chancery at the age of only thirty- 
five seemed to set him on a path which would lead him to 
the top of the diplomatic service, or a position close to it. 
But Maclean became deeply depressed at his insensitive 
handling by the Cairo residency. The documents he 
supplied were accepted without comment and no 
indication was given by the Centre of what was expected 
of him. In December 1949 Maclean attached to a bundle 
of classified diplomatic documents a note asking to be 
allowed to give up his work for Soviet intelligence. The 
Cairo residency gave so little thought to running Maclean 
that it forwarded his note unread to Moscow. Incredibly, 
the Centre also ignored it. Not till Maclean sent another 
appeal in April 1950, asking to be released from the 
intolerable strain of his double life, did he attract the 



Centre’s attention. It then read for the first time the letter 
he had sent four months earlier.^ 

While the Centre was deliberating, Maclean went 
berserk. One evening in May, while in a drunken rage, he 
and his drinking companion Philip Toynbee broke into the 
flat of two female members of the US embassy, ransacked 
their bedroom, ripped apart their underclothes, then 
moved on to destroy the bathroom. There, Toynbee later 
recalled, “Donald raises a large mirror above his head and 
crashes it into the bath, when to my amazement and 
delight, alas, the bath breaks in two while the mirror 
remains intact.” A few days later Maclean was sent back 
to London where the Foreign Office gave him the summer 
off and paid for treatment by a psychiatrist who diagnosed 
overwork, marital problems and repressed homosexuality. 
In the autumn, apparently back in control of himself, at 
least in office hours, he was made head of the American 
desk in the Foreign Office. 

The impact of Burgess’s and Maclean’s intelligence in 
Moscow was heightened by the outbreak of the Korean 
War in June 1950. Maclean’s deputy on the American 
desk, Robert Cecil, later concluded that the Kremlin must 
have found the documents provided by Maclean “of 
inestimable value in advising the Chinese and the North 
Koreans on strategy and negotiating positions.”^ In 
addition to supplying classified documents, Maclean and 
Burgess also put their own anti-American gloss on them 



and thus strengthened Soviet fears that the United States 
might escalate the Korean conflict into world war. For 
perhaps the first time in his diplomatic career, Maclean 
showed open sympathy in a Foreign Office minute with 
the crude Stalinist analysis of the inherently aggressive 
designs of American finance capital. There was, he said, 
“some point” to the argument that the American economy 
was now so geared to the military machine that all-out 
war might seem preferable to a recession produced by 
demobilization. ^ 

The Centre’s most prized British agent, however, 
remained Kim Philby, who, it was hoped, would one day 
rise to become Chief of the Secret Service. In the autumn 
of 1949 he was appointed SIS station commander in 
Washington. Philby was exultant. His new posting, he 
later wrote, brought him “right back into the middle of 
intelligence policy-making” and gave him “a close-up 
view of the American intelligence organizations.”^ 

Before his departure for the United States, Philby was 
“indoctrinated” into the VENONA secret. Though aware 
of the possibility that one of the decrypts might identify 
him as a Soviet agent, he was doubtless reassured to 
discover that VENONA provided comparatively little 
information on NKGB activities in Britain. The bulk of 
the Soviet intelligence decrypts concerned operations in 
the United States. In late September 1949, immediately 
after the successful test of the first Soviet atomic bomb. 



Philby discovered during his VENONA briefing that the 
atom spy CHARLES in Los Alamos had been identified 
as Klaus Fuchs. The Centre promptly warned those of its 
American agents who had been in contact with Fuchs that 
they might have to escape through Mexico. It did not, 
however, succeed in warning Fuchs, who in April 1950 
was sentenced to fourteen years’ imprisonment. 

On his arrival in Washington in October 1949, Philby 
quickly succeeded in gaining regular access to VENONA 
decrypts. That access became particularly important after 
the arrest and imprisonment in the following year of 
William Weisband, the American agent who had first 
revealed the VENONA secret to the Centre. Philby’ s 
liaison duties with the CIA allowed him to warn the 
Centre of American as well as British operations against 
the Soviet Bloc, even enabling him to provide the 
geographical coordinates of parachute drops by British 
and American agents. When writing his memoirs later, 
Philby was sometimes unable to resist gloating over the 
fate of the hundreds of agents he betrayed. Referring to 
those who parachuted into the arms of the MGB, he wrote 
with macabre irony, ‘T do not know what happened to the 
parties concerned. But I can make an informed guess. 

Philby’ s success in Washington was achieved despite, 
rather than because of, the assistance given him by the 
KI/MGB in Washington. The chaotic state of the 
Washington residency, which led to the recall of two 



successive residents in 1948-9/^^ made Philby refuse to 
have any contact with any legal Soviet intelligence 
officers in the United States. For almost a year Philby’s 
sole contact with the Centre was via messages sent to 
Burgess in London. 

In the summer of 1950 Philby received an unexpected 
letter from Burgess. “I have a shock for you,” Burgess 
began. “I have just been posted to Washington.” Philby 
later claimed in his memoirs that he had agreed to put 
Burgess up in his large neoclassical house at 4100 
Nebraska Avenue during his tour of duty at the 
Washington embassy to try to keep him out of the 
spectacular “scrapes” for which he was now notorious. 
The “scrapes,” however, continued. In January 1951 
Burgess burst in on a dinner party given by the Philby s 
and drew an insulting (and allegedly obscene) caricature 
of Libby Harvey, wife of a CIA officer. The Harveys 
stormed out, Aileen Philby retired to the kitchen and Kim 
sat with his head in his hands, repeatedly asking Burgess, 
“How could you? How could you?”^^^ 

Despite Burgess’s scrapes in the United States, he 
fulfilled an important role as courier between Philby and 
his newly appointed case officer, a Russian illegal 
codenamed HARRY (GARRI in Cyrillic transliteration), 
who had arrived in New York a few months before 
Burgess began his posting at the Washington embassy. 
HARRY had been bom Valeri Mikhaylovich Makayev in 



1918. In May 1947 he had been sent to Warsaw to 
establish his legend as a US citizen who had lived for 
some years in Poland. As evidence of his bogus identity 
the Centre gave him an out-of-date US passport issued in 
1930 to Ivan (“John”) Mikhailovich Kovalik, bom in 
Chicago to Ukrainian parents in 1917.^^^ The real 
Kovalik, whose identity Makayev assumed, had been 
taken to Poland as a child by his parents in 1930, later 
settling in the Soviet Union; he died in 1957 in 
Chelyabinskaya Oblast. 

After two years in Warsaw, Makayev was able to 
obtain a new US passport in the name of Kovalik with the 
help of a female clerk at the American embassy. The 
MGB discovered that in November 1948, without 
informing the embassy, the clerk had married a Polish 
citizen with whom she planned to return to the United 
States after her tour of duty. Anxious to keep her marriage 
secret, she was pressured by the MGB into swearing 
under oath that she was personally acquainted with 
Kovalik and his parents and could vouch for his good 
character. According to Makayev ’s file, his application 
for a new US passport was “processed in an expeditious 
manner and with significant deviations from the mles.” 
The cormpt embassy clerk received a reward of 750 
dollars. 

On March 5, 1950 Makayev left Gdynia for the United 
States on board the ship Batory. ™ The Centre concluded 



that his cover, like Fisher’s, could best be preserved 
within New York’s cosmopolitan artistic community. 
Soon after his arrival, he began an affair with a Polish- 
bom ballerina, codenamed ALICE, who owned a ballet 
studio in Manhattan. Makayev’s gifts as a musician 
probably exceeded Fisher’s as a painter. After a brief 
period working as a furrier, he succeeded in obtaining a 
job teaching musical composition at New York 
University. 

The Centre had high hopes of Makayev. He was given 
25,000 dollars to establish a new illegal American 
residency to mn parallel with Fisher’s. Two other Soviet 
illegals were selected to work under him: Reino 
Hayhanen (codenamed VIK), who had assumed a bogus 
Finnish identity, and Vitali Ivanovich Ly ampin (DIM or 
DIMA), who had an Austrian legend. Two dedicated 
communications channels were prepared for the new 
residency: a postal route between agents MAY in New 
York and GERY in London, and a courier route using 
ASKO, a Finnish seaman on a ship which traveled 
between Finland and New York. Makayev impressed the 
Centre by getting to know the family of the Republican 
senator for Vermont, Ralph E. Flanders. His main 
mission, however, was to act as controller of Moscow’s 
most important British agent, Kim Philby.^^^ 

Burgess’s first journey as a courier between Philby in 
Washington and Makayev in New York took place in 



November 1950.^^^ The main pretext for his journeys to 
New York was to visit his friend Alan Maclean (younger 
brother of Donald), private secretary to the British 
representative at the United Nations, Gladwyn Jebb.^^^ 
Once the liaison established by Burgess was working 
smoothly, Philby agreed to meet Makayev himself 
Burgess, however, continued to act as the usual method of 
communication between Philby and his case officer. 
His visits to Alan Maclean became so frequent that Jebb 
formed the mistaken impression that the two men “shared 
a flat.” Conversations with Alan doubtless also helped 
Burgess keep track of Donald Maclean’s unstable mental 
state. 

Some of the most important intelligence which Philby 
supplied to Makayev directly concerned Maclean. The 
VENONA decrypts to which he had access contained a 
number of references to an agent codenamed HOMER 
operating in Washington at the end of the war, but 
initially only vague clues to his identity. Philby quickly 
realized that HOMER was Maclean, but was informed by 
the Centre that “Maclean should stay in his post as long as 
possible” and that plans would be made to rescue him 
“before the net closed in.”^^^ The net did not begin to 
close until the winter of 1950-1. By the end of 1950 the 
list of suspects had narrowed to thirty-five. By the 
beginning of April 1951 it had shrunk to nine.^^^ A few 
days later a telegram decrypted by Meredith Gardner 



finally identified HOMER as Maclean. It revealed that in 
June 1944 HOMER’ s wife was expecting a baby and 
living with her mother in New York^^^ — information 
which fitted Melinda Maclean but not the wife of any 
other suspect. 

There still remained a breathing space of at least a few 
weeks in which to arrange Maclean’s escape. The search 
for the evidence necessary to convict him of espionage, 
complicated by the decision not to use VENONA in any 
prosecution, made necessary a period of surveillance by 
MI5 before any arrest. The plan to warn Maclean that he 
had been identified as a Soviet agent was worked out not 
by the Centre but by Philby and Burgess. In April 1951 
Burgess was ordered home in disgrace after a series of 
escapades had aroused the collective wrath of the Virginia 
State Police, the State Department and the British 
ambassador. On the eve of Burgess’s departure from New 
York aboard the Queen Mary, he and Philby dined 
together in a Chinese restaurant where the piped music 
inhibited eavesdropping and agreed that Burgess would 
convey a warning to both Maclean and the London 
residency as soon as he reached Britain. 

Philby was even more concerned with his own survival 
than with Maclean’s. If Maclean cracked under 
interrogation, as seemed possible in view of his 
overwrought condition, Philby and the rest of the Five 
would also be at risk. Mitrokhin’s notes on the KGB file 



record: “STANLEY [Philby] demanded HOMER’ s 
immediate exfiltration to the USSR, so that he himself 
would not be compromised.”^^^ He also extracted an 
assurance from Burgess that he would not accompany 
Maclean to Moscow, for that too would compromise him. 
Immediately after his return to England on May 7, 
Burgess called on Blunt and asked him to deliver a 
message to Modin, whom Blunt knew as “Peter.” 
According to Modin, Blunt’s anxious appearance, even 
before he spoke, indicated that something was desperately 
wrong. “Peter,” he said, “there’s serious trouble. Guy 
Burgess has just arrived back in London. HOMER’ s 
about to be arrested ... Donald’s now in such a state that 
I’m convinced he’ll break down the moment they 
question him.” Two days later the Centre agreed to 
Maclean’ s exfiltration. 

Meanwhile Burgess had seen Maclean and was worried 
that, despite (or because of) his nervous exhaustion, he 
might refuse to defect. He reported to Modin and the 
London resident, Nikolai Rodin, that Maclean could not 
bring himself to leave his wife Melinda, who was 
expecting their third child in a few weeks’ time. When 
Rodin reported Maclean’s hesitations to Moscow, the 
Centre telegraphed, “HOMER must agree to defect.” 
Melinda Maclean, who had been aware that her husband 
was a Soviet spy ever since he had asked her to marry 
him, agreed that, for his own safety, he should leave for 



Moscow without delay. It was clear, however, that 
Maclean would need an escort. On May 17 the Centre 
instructed the London residency that Burgess was to 
accompany him to Moscow. Burgess initially refused to 
go, recalling his promise to Philby not to defect, and 
seemed to Modin “close to hysteria.” Rodin, however, 
seems to have persuaded Burgess to go by giving the 
impression that he would not need to accompany Maclean 
all the way, and would in any case be free to return to 
London. In reality, the Centre believed that Burgess had 
become a liability and was determined to get him to 
Moscow — by deception, if necessary — and keep him 
there. “As long as he agreed to go with Maclean,” wrote 
Modin later, “the rest mattered precious little. Cynically 
enough, the Centre had ... concluded that we had not one 
but two bumt-out agents on our hands. 

Though the Foreign Secretary, Herbert Morrison, had 
secretly authorized the interrogation of Maclean, no date 
had been decided for it to begin. The London 
residency, however, mistakenly believed that Maclean 
was to be arrested on Monday, May 28, and made plans 
for his exfiltration with Burgess during the previous 
weekend. It reported to the Centre that surveillance of 
Maclean by MI5 and Special Branch ceased at 8 p.m. 
each day and at weekends. (It may not have realized that 
there was no surveillance at all of Maclean at his home at 
Tatsfield on the Kent-Surrey border.) The residency also 



discovered that the pleasure boat Falaise made weekend 
round-trip cruises from Southampton, calling in at French 
ports, which did not require passports. Burgess was 
instructed to buy tickets for himself and Maclean under 
assumed names for the cruise leaving at midnight on 
Friday, May 25. That evening Burgess arrived at Tatsfield 
in a hired car, had dinner with the Macleans, then drove 
off with Donald to Southampton where they were just in 
time to board the Falaise before it set sail. The next 
morning they left the boat at St. Malo, made their way to 
Rennes and caught the train to Paris. From Paris they took 
another train to Switzerland, where they were issued false 
passports by the Soviet embassy in Berne. In Zurich they 
bought air tickets to Stockholm via Prague, but left the 
plane at Prague, where they were met by Soviet 
intelligence officers. By the time Melinda Maclean had 
reported that her husband had not returned home after the 
weekend, Burgess and Maclean were behind the Iron 
Curtain. 

Once in the Soviet Union, Burgess was told that he 
would not be allowed back to Britain but would receive 
an annual pension of 2,000 roubles. Modin later 
complained that his talents were wasted by the Centre: 
“He read a lot, walked and occasionally picked up another 
man for sex ... He might have been very useful to [the 
KGB]; but instead he did nothing because nothing was 
asked of him, and it was not in his nature to solicit 



work.”^^^ Maclean was rather better treated than Burgess. 
He settled in Kuibyshev, took Soviet citizenship under the 
name Mark Petrovich Fraser, was awarded an annual 
pension twice that of Burgess and taught for the next two 
years at the Kuibyshev Pedagogical Institute. In 
September 1953, in an operation codenamed SIRA, his 
wife and three children were exfiltrated from Britain to 
join him in Kuibyshev. 

THE CENTRE CONGRATULATED itself that the 
successful exfiltration of Burgess and Maclean had 
“raised the authority of the Soviet intelligence service in 
the eyes of Soviet agents.”^^^ That, however, was not 
Philby’s view. At a meeting on May 24, Makayev had 
found him “alarmed and concerned for his own security” 
and insistent that he would be put “in jeopardy” if 
Burgess as well as Maclean fled to Moscow. The first 
that Philby learned of Burgess’s defection with Maclean 
was during a briefing about five days later by the MI5 
liaison officer in Washington. “My consternation [at the 
news],” wrote Philby later, “was no pretense.” Later that 
day he drove into the Virginia countryside and buried the 
photographic equipment with which he had copied 
documents for Soviet intelligence in a forest — an action 
he had mentally rehearsed many times since arriving in 
Washington two years earlier. Just when Philby most 
needed his controller’s assistance, however, Makayev let 



him down. The New York legal residency left a message 
and 2,000 dollars in a dead letter-box for HARRY to 
deliver to Philby. Makayev failed to find them and Philby 
never received them.^^^ 

An inquiry by the Centre into Makayev ’s conduct in 
New York, prompted by his failure to help Philby, was 
highly critical. It found him guilty of “lack of discipline,” 
“violations of the Centre’s orders” and “crude 
manners” — a defect blamed on his neglected childhood. 
Plans for Makayev to found a new illegal residency in the 
United States were canceled and he was transferred to 
Fisher’s residency so that he could receive expert 
supervision. His performance, however, failed to improve. 
While returning to New York from leave in Moscow, he 
lost a hollow imitation Swiss coin which contained secret 
operational instructions on microfilm. After a further 
inquiry at the Centre, Makayev was recalled and his 
career as an illegal terminated. Attempts to recover 9,000 
dollars allotted to him in New York (2,000 dollars in bank 
accounts and 7,000 dollars in stocks) were unsuccessful 
and the whole sum had to be written off.^^^ 

The Centre calculated that since their recruitment in 
1934-5, Philby, Burgess and Maclean had supplied more 
than 20,000 pages of “valuable” classified documents and 
agent reports. As Philby had feared, however, the 
defection of Burgess and Maclean did severe, though not 
quite terminal, damage to the careers in Soviet 



intelligence of the other members of the Magnificent Five. 
Immediately after the defection, Blunt went through 
Burgess’s flat, searching for and destroying incriminating 
documents. He failed, however, to notice a series of 
unsigned notes describing confidential discussions in 
Whitehall in 1939. In the course of a lengthy MI5 
investigation. Sir John Colville, one of those mentioned in 
the notes, was able to identify the author as Caimcross. 
MI5 began surveillance of Caimcross and followed him to 
a hurriedly arranged meeting with his controller, Modin. 
Just in time, Modin noticed the surveillance and returned 
home without meeting Caimcross. At a subsequent 
interrogation by MI5, Caimcross admitted passing 
information to the Russians but denied being a spy. 
Shortly afterwards he received “a large sum of money” at 
a farewell meeting with Modin, resigned from the 
Treasury and went to live abroad. 

Immediately after the defection of Burgess and 
Maclean, the Centre instmcted Modin to press Blunt to 
follow them to Moscow. Unwilling to exchange the 
prestigious, congenial surroundings of the Courtauld 
Institute for the bleak socialist realism of Stalin’s Russia, 
Blunt refused. ‘T know perfectly well how your people 
live,” Blunt told his controller, “and I can assure you it 
would be very hard, almost unbearable, for me to do 
likewise.” Modin, by his own account, was left 
speechless. Blunt was rightly confident that MI5 would 
have no hard evidence against him. Soviet intelligence 



had few further dealings with him.^^^ 

As Philby had feared, the defection of his friend and 
former lodger, Burgess, placed him under immediate 
suspicion. The Director of Central Intelligence, General 
Walter Bedell Smith, promptly informed SIS that he was 
no longer acceptable as its liaison officer in Washington. 
On his return to London, Philby was officially retired 
from SIS. In December 1951 he was summoned to a 
“judicial inquiry” at MI5 headquarters — in effect an 
informal trial, of which he later gave a misleading account 
in his memoirs. According to one of those present, “There 
was not a single officer who sat through the proceedings 
who came away not totally convinced of Philby’ s guilt.” 
Contrary to the impression Philby sought to create in 
Moscow after his defection twelve years later, many of 
his own former colleagues in SIS shared the opinion of 
MI5. But the “judicial inquiry” concluded that it would 
probably never be possible to find the evidence for a 
successful prosecution. Within SIS Philby retained the 
support of a loyal group of friends to whom he cleverly 
presented himself as the innocent victim of a McCarthyite 
witch-hunt. Soviet intelligence had no further contact with 
him until 1954.^^^ 

Philby seems never to have realized that Burgess’s 
sudden defection was the result not of his own loss of 
nerve but of a cynical deception by the Centre, and never 
forgave Burgess for putting him in jeopardy. By the time 
Philby himself finally defected to Moscow in 1963, 



Burgess was on his death bed. He asked his old friend to 
visit him at the KGB hospital in Pekhotnaya Street. Philby 
refused to go.^^^ His sense of grievance was increased by 
his own reception in Moscow. Philby had long believed 
that he was an officer in the Soviet foreign intelligence 
service and was shocked to discover that, as a foreign 
agent, he would never be awarded officer rank. Worse 
still, he was not fully trusted by the leadership either of 
the KGB or its First Chief (Foreign Intelligence) 
Directorate. Not until the sixtieth anniversary celebrations 
of the October Revolution, fourteen years after his arrival 
in Moscow, was the KGB’s most celebrated Western 
agent at last allowed to enter its headquarters. 



TEN 


THE MAIN ADVERSARY 


Part 1: North American Illegals in the 1950s 


One of the most remarkable public appearances ever 
made by a Soviet illegal took place on November 6, 1951, 
when “Teodoro B. Castro” attended the opening in Paris 
of the Sixth Session of the United Nations General 
Assembly as an adviser to the Costa Rican delegation. 
Castro was, in reality, Iosif Romualdovich Grigulevich 
(variously codenamed MAKS, ARTUR and DAKS),^ a 
Lithuanian Jew whose main previous expertise had been 
in sabotage and assassination. He had trained saboteurs 
during the Spanish Civil War, taken a leading role in the 
operations to kill Trotsky in Mexico and had run a 
wartime illegal residency in Argentina which specialized 
in the sabotage of ships and cargoes bound for Germany.^ 
While in Argentina, Grigulevich had begun to develop an 



elaborate Latin American legend for use after the war.^ 
Late in 1949, Grigulevich and his wife, Laura Araujo 
Aguilar (a Mexican illegal agent codenamed LUIZA), set 
up an illegal residency in Rome. Posing as Teodoro 
Castro, the illegitimate son of a dead (and childless) Costa 
Rican notable, Grigulevich established a small import- 
export business to provide cover for his intelligence work. 
In the autumn of 1950 he made the acquaintance of a 
visiting delegation from Costa Rica which included the 
leading Costa Rican politician of his generation, Jose 
Figueres Ferrer, head of the founding junta of the Second 
Republic which had restored constitutional government 
and later President of the Republic in 1953-8 and 1970-4. 
Grigulevich ’s success in winning Figueres ’s confidence 
must have exceeded his wildest expectations. 
Hoodwinked by Grigulevich’ s fraudulent account of his 
illegitimate birth, Figueres told him they were distant 
relatives. Thereafter, according to Grigulevich’ s file, he 
became the friend and confidant of the future president, 
using the Centre’s money to invest with him in an Italian 
firm importing Costa Rican coffee.^ 

In October 1951, under his cover name Teodoro Castro, 
Grigulevich was appointed Costa Rica’s charge d’affaires 
in Rome. A month later he was chosen as an adviser to 
the Costa Rican delegation to the Sixth Session of the UN 
General Assembly at its meeting in Paris. During the 
assembly he was introduced to the US Secretary of State, 
Dean Acheson, and the British Foreign Secretary, 



Anthony Eden — ^but not, apparently, to the Soviet Foreign 
Minister, Andrei Vyshinsky.^ Vyshinsky’s usual 
oratorical style at international gatherings was tedious and 
longwinded. On this occasion, however, he arrived with a 
caged dove, intended to represent the innocent victims of 
imperialist aggression, then proceeded to speak with the 
brutal sarcasm for which he had been infamous as 
prosecutor during the show trials of the Great Terror. 
Referring to a speech by President Truman on arms 
limitation, Vyshinsky declared in the course of a lengthy 
diatribe, ‘T could hardly sleep all night last night having 
read that speech. I could not sleep because I kept 
laughing.”^ 

Among the other targets for Vyshinsky’s sarcasm was 
the Costa Rican delegation. One of the motions debated 
by the General Assembly was the call by the Greek 
delegation for the return to Greece of the children 
evacuated to the Soviet Bloc during the Greek civil war. 
At Acheson’s request, the Costa Rican delegation agreed 
to support the motion. Doubtless to his extreme 
embarrassment, Grigulevich was chosen to draft a speech 
in favor of it to be delivered by Jorge Martinez Moreno. 
He did his best to limit the offense to the Soviet 
delegation by somewhat vacuous rhetoric which 
emphasized “the anxiety and the interest with which [the 
Costa Rican] delegation had always considered any threat 
liable to endanger the peace of the world,” and 
congratulated the UN Special Committee on the Balkans 



“for its work of observation and conciliation, thanks to 
which ... although the Balkans remained a danger, at least 
world peace had been safeguarded.” The Soviet 
delegation was unimpressed. Probably unaware of 
Castro’s real identity, Vyshinsky condemned the speech 
as the ramblings of a diplomatic clown. ^ 

Vyshinsky’s denunciation, however, did nothing to 
damage Grigulevich’s diplomatic career. On May 14, 
1952 he presented his letters of credence as Envoy 
Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of Costa Rica 
in Rome to the Italian president, Luigi Einaudi. According 
to his file, Grigulevich was on good terms with the 
American ambassador, Ellsworth Bunker, and his 
successor, Claire Boothe Luce, and successfully 
cultivated the Costa Rican nuncio to the Vatican, Prince 
Giulio Pacelli, a nephew of Pope Pius XII. Grigulevich 
had a total of fifteen audiences with the Pope. He also 
made friends with one of Italy’s leading post-war 
politicians, the Christian Democrat Alcide de Gasperi 
(Prime Minister, 1945-53), who gave him a camera 
inscribed “In token of our friendship.”^ 

Grigulevich’s astonishing transformation from Soviet 
saboteur and assassin into a popular and successful Latin 
American diplomat, combined with the initial success of 
“Willie” Fisher’s illegal residency in providing 
“supersecref ’ nuclear intelligence from the United States,^ 
seemed to vindicate the Centre’s early Cold War strategy 



of attempting to recreate the age of the Great Illegals. The 
role of the post-war illegals was considered to be 
potentially even more important than that of their 
illustrious predecessors. If the Cold War turned into hot 
war, as the Centre thought quite possible, Soviet 
embassies and the legal residencies they contained would 
have to be withdrawn from NATO countries, leaving the 
illegals to run wartime intelligence operations. 

DESPITE THE EARLY Cold War success of Grigulevich 
and Fisher, the mood in the Centre at the beginning of the 
1950s was anything but triumphalist. As a result of the 
identification of Soviet spies in the VENONA decrypts, 
following the earlier revelations by Bentley, Chambers 
and Gouzenko, the Centre had to set about rebuilding 
almost its entire American agent network while operating 
under far closer FBI surveillance than ever before. It 
could no longer count on significant help from the 
Communist Party of the United States (CPUS A), which 
during the Second World War had assisted Soviet 
penetration of the Roosevelt administration, the 
intelligence community and the MANHATTAN project. 

In 1949 Gene Dennis, the CPUS A general secretary, and 
ten other party leaders were tried on charges of 
advocating the forcible overthrow of the federal 
government. Dennis and nine of the defendants were 
sentenced to five years in jail, the eleventh was jailed for 
three years, and all the defense attorneys were found in 



contempt of court. After the Supreme Court upheld the 
sentences in 1951, more than a hundred other leading 
Communists were convicted on similar charges. For most 
of the decade the Party was forced into a largely 
underground existence. 

The Centre was also greatly exercised by the 
unprecedented publicity given to Soviet intelligence 
operations in the United States. On January 24, 1950 
Klaus Fuchs began confessing his wartime espionage at 
Los Alamos to his British interrogators. The next day, in 
New York, Alger Hiss was sentenced to five years’ 
imprisonment for perjury in denying espionage charges 
before a Grand Jury. On February 2 Fuchs was formally 
charged in London, and the menace of Soviet atomic 
espionage burst on to the front pages of the American 
press. A week later the previously little-known Wisconsin 
senator, Joseph R. McCarthy, falsely claimed to have the 
names of 205 State Department Communists who were 
“shaping” American foreign policy. Despite his 
outrageous inventions and exaggerations, McCarthy 
rapidly won a mass following. He did so because he 
succeeded in striking a popular chord. To many 
Americans the idea of an “enemy within,” given 
plausibility by the convictions of Hiss and Fuchs 
(followed a year later by those of the Rosenbergs), helped 
to explain why the United States, despite its immense 
power, seemed unable to prevent the onward march of 
world Communism and the emergence of the Soviet 



Union as a nuclear superpower. As late as January 1954 
opinion polls found 50 percent of Americans with a 
favorable opinion of McCarthy and only 29 percent 
opposed to him. 

President Truman’s claim in 1951 that “the greatest 
asset that the Kremlin has is Senator McCarthy” was, in 
the long run, to be proved right. McCarthy ultimately did 
more for the Soviet cause than any agent of influence the 
KGB ever had. His preposterous self-serving crusade 
against the “Red Menace” made liberal opinion around 
the world skeptical of the reality of Moscow’s secret 
intelligence offensive against the Main Adversary. Even 
Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, executed one after the other 
in the same electric chair at New York’s Sing Sing Prison 
in 1953, were widely believed to have been framed. It 
took some years, however, for the Centre to grasp the 
enormous propaganda advantages of McCarthyism. At the 
time the Centre was chiefly concerned by the increased 
difficulties created by “spy mania” in the United States 
for its attempts to recruit and run new American agents. 

McCarthyism reinforced the Centre’s belief in the 
importance of expanding its illegal presence on the 
territory of the Main Adversary. While legal residencies 
based in official Soviet missions were inevitably subject 
to increasingly sophisticated FBI surveillance, illegal 
residencies could operate freely so long as they remained 
unidentified. Since his arrival in the United States in 1947 
“Willie” Fisher (MARK) had attracted no suspicion 



whatsoever — despite the fact that his agent, Theodore 
Hall, was interrogated by the FBI in 1951 after his 
identity was disclosed by the VENONA decrypts. The 
Centre also took seriously the possibility that illegal 
residencies might have to take over all intelligence 
operations if war or other crises led to the expulsion of 
Soviet missions and legal residencies. The preparations 
for a major expansion of the illegal residencies were 
enormously detailed. In 1954 the Illegals Directorate drew 
up plans for a network of 130 “documentation agents” 
whose sole responsibility was to obtain birth certificates, 
passports and other documents to support the illegals’ 
legends. Operations officers specializing in illegal 
documentation were posted in twenty-two Western and 
Third World residencies, as well as in China and all 
Soviet Bloc KGB liaison missions. 

There were, however, more serious obstacles than the 
Centre was willing to acknowledge than the expansion of 
its illegal networks. The age of the Great Illegals — 
brilliant cosmopolitans such as Deutsch and Maly, able to 
inspire others with their own visionary faith in the future 
of the Soviet system — had gone, never to return. Turning 
Soviet citizens brought up in the authoritarian, 
intellectually blinkered command economy of Stalin’s 
Russia into people who could pass as Westerners and 
cope successfully with life in the United States was to 
prove a daunting, as well as time-consuming, business. 



Recruiting high-flying ideologically committed American 
agents was also vastly more difficult during the Cold War 
than during the 1930s or the Second World War. The 
Soviet Union had lost much of its appeal even to young 
radical intellectuals alienated by the materialism and 
injustices of American society. It was deeply ironic that 
when McCarthy’s self-serving campaign against the Red 
Menace was at its height, Soviet penetration of the 
American government was at its lowest ebb for almost 
thirty years. 

The Centre was further hampered by its own 
cumbersome bureaucracy, complicated during the final 
years of the Stalinist era by the rise and fall of the 
Committee of Information (KI) as the overseer of Soviet 
foreign intelligence.^^ In the course of the Cold War, the 
organization of the Illegals Directorate changed eight 
times, and the role assigned to it was modified on 
fourteen different occasions. Aleksandr Korotkov, the 
head of the directorate during the first decade of the Cold 
War, had no experience of life in the West and little 
understanding of the problems faced by illegals in the 
United States. Few of his grandiose plans for illegal 
operations against the Main Adversary were ever realized. 

Throughout the 1950s, the Centre struggled to establish 
even one more illegal residency in the United States to 
add to that of Fisher. The first attempt to found a second 
residency collapsed in ignominious failure, the recall in 
1951 of Makayev (HARRY), the intended resident, and 



the disappearance of 9,000 dollars of KI funds. The next 
attempt was more cautious. Using a strategy which it was 
later to repeat, the Centre decided to send a potential 
illegal resident to Canada, wait until he was well 
established, and only then move him on to the more 
difficult terrain of the Main Adversary. The first Soviet 
illegal to use Canada as a staging post for the United 
States was the 30-year-old Yevgeni Vladimirovich Brik 
(codenamed HART), who landed in Halifax, Nova Scotia, 
in November 1951 with instructions to take up residence 
in Montreal. 

Brik had the great advantage of a bilingual education. 
From 1932 to 1937 he had been a pupil at the Anglo- 
American School in Moscow, subsequently spending 
several years in New York, where his father worked for 
Amtorg, the Soviet trade mission in the United States, 
before returning to serve in the Red Army during the 
Great Patriotic War. In 1948 Brik was instructed to 
cultivate Western pupils at his old school in order to test 
his suitability for intelligence work in North America. 
Having succeeded in that exercise to the Centre’s 
satisfaction, he began a two-year training course in 1949, 
covering ciphers, secret writing, use of short-wave radio, 
selection and use of dead letter-boxes, anti- surveillance 
precautions and methods of intelligence collection. Brik 
was also taught the trade of a watchmaker in order to 
enable him to start a small business in Canada. 



For his journey to Canada, Brik adopted the identity of 
a Canadian “live double,” Ivan Vasilyevich Gladysh 
(codenamed FRED), recruited in July 1951 specifically to 
provide cover for him. On instructions from the Centre, 
Gladysh crossed the Atlantic to Britain, then traveled 
through France and West Germany to Vienna, where he 
met Brik. In Vienna Gladysh briefed Brik on the details of 
his life in Canada and his journey to Europe, then gave 
him his Canadian passport. Brik pasted his own 
photograph in the passport in place of Gladysh’ s and set 
off across the Atlantic.^ ^ After landing at Halifax, Brik 
took a train to Montreal and went to the station lavatories. 
On one of the cubicle doors he saw the chalk mark he had 
been told to expect. He went inside, removed the top of 
the cistern and found taped to the underside the birth 
certificate and other documents belonging to another “live 
double,” David Semyonovich Soboloff.^^ Soboloff 
(codenamed SOKOL) had been bom in Toronto in 1919 
but at the age of sixteen had emigrated with his family to 
the Soviet Union. In 1951 he was working as a teacher at 
the Magnitogorsk Mining and Metallurgical Institute. For 
the remainder of his time in Canada Brik became David 
Soboloff. In July he obtained a passport in his name.^^ 
Brik succeeded in persuading the Centre that there was 
no realistic possibility of establishing himself as a 
watchmaker in Montreal, and that he should open a 
oneman photographic studio instead. While in Montreal, 



he was instructed to begin making plans for emigration to 
the United States.^^ Brik, however, proved an even more 
disastrous choice than Makayev as the potential head of 
an illegal American residency. Without telling the Centre, 
in October 1953 he began a passionate affair with the wife 
of a Canadian soldier living in Kingston, Ontario. In 
order not to break contact with her, Brik persuaded the 
Centre that it would be premature for him to move to the 
United States. Before long he admitted to his lover that he 
was a Russian spy living under a false identity and tried to 
persuade her to leave her husband. She refused but 
begged him to go to the RCMP (Royal Canadian Mounted 
Police) and make a voluntary confession.^^ 

In November 1953 Brik gave in to his lover’s pleas and 
telephoned the RCMP headquarters in Ottawa. Terry 
Guernsey, the head of the diminutive B (Counter- 
intelligence) Branch of the RCMP Security Service, 
decided to run Brik (codenamed GIDEON by B Branch) 
as a double agent in order to uncover as much as possible 
about Soviet intelligence operations in Canada. GIDEON 
proved unusually difficult to run, particularly when his 
lover broke off their affair, and his drinking ran 
periodically out of control. On one occasion, after 
consuming more than a bottle of Old Tom gin, he rang the 
Montreal Gazette and, to the horror of the RCMP officer 
monitoring his telephone calls, said in a drunken slur, 
‘T’m a Russian spy. Do you want a story?” Like the 



Ottawa Journal which had turned away Gouzenko in 
September 1945, the Gazette failed to realize it was being 
offered the spy story exclusive of the decade and 
dismissed the caller as a drunk.^^ 

Until the summer of 1955 it did not occur to the KGB 
that the illegal HART (Brik) might now be a double 
agent. Once it was satisfied that he had successfully 
established his bogus identity and cover profession in 
Montreal, the Centre proceeded to the next stage in his 
development as an illegal resident whose main role would 
be as an agent controller. Between 1951 and 1953 the 
Ottawa legal residency, spurred on by Moscow’s criticism 
of its inertia since the defection of Gouzenko, recruited 
eleven agents (all apparently fairly low-level) with the 
assistance of the Canadian Communist Party. Five were 
Communists and most supplied scientific and 
technological intelligence.^^ By transferring some of the 
agents to an illegal controller, the Centre hoped to 
overcome the problems created by the RCMP security 
service’s surveillance of the Ottawa embassy. 

By the time the KGB realized that Brik was under 
RCMP control, it had put him in touch with five agents. 
Three were male: LISTER, a Toronto Communist of 
Ukrainian origin bom in 1919; LIND, an Irish-Canadian 
Communist employee of the A. V. Roe aircraft company, 
also resident in Toronto; and POMOSHCHNIK, the 
Communist owner of a radio and television sales and 



service business in Ottawa.^^ The intelligence supplied by 
LIND included plans for the CF-105 Avro Arrow, then 
among the most advanced jet fighter aircraft in the 
world. Brik also knew the identities of EMMA and 
MARA, two female agents used as “live letterboxes” 
(LLBs) for communications with the Centre. EMMA, 
who had been recruited while studying at the Sorbonne in 
1951, took the Canadian External Affairs Ministry 
entrance examination, but was unsuccessful. In 1954 she 
opened an arts and crafts shop in Quebec. MARA was a 
French fashion designer, bom in 1939, the co-owner of a 
furniture shop in Paris who was used as an LLB for KGB 
communications from Canada.^ ^ 

The Centre later concluded that Brik had betrayed all 
five of the agents with whom he had been put in contact. 
He was unaware, however, of the identity of Hugh 
Hambleton, ultimately the most important of the agents 
recmited by the Ottawa legal residency in the early 1950s. 
Hambleton had been bom in Ottawa in 1922 and had 
spent some of his childhood in France, where his father 
was a Canadian press correspondent. During the Second 
World War he served as an intelligence officer with the 
Free French in Algiers and, after the Liberation, in Paris, 
before becoming French liaison officer with the US 
army’s 103rd Division in Europe. In 1945 he transferred 
to the Canadian army and spent a year based in 
Strasbourg analyzing intelligence on occupied Germany, 



and interrogating prisoners-of-war. Unsurprisingly, the 
post-war years seemed dull by comparison. “To be 
important, to have people pay attention to you,” he once 
said, “that is what counts in life.”^^ The KGB gave him 
the recognition which he craved. 

Hambleton’s KGB file reveals for the first time that he 
emerged from the war as a committed Communist and 
was talent- spotted by the Centre’s “Canadian friends.” 
Harry Baker, one of the Canadian Communist leaders, 
picked him out at Party meetings and later vouched for his 
ideological reliability. Another Party member, codenamed 
SVYASHCHENIK (“Priest”), carried out background 
checks on him. In 1952 Hambleton was recruited as a 
Soviet agent by the Ottawa resident, Vladimir 
Trofimovich Burdin, and given the codename RIMEN 
(later changed to RADOV). Two years later Hambleton 
moved to Paris where he began postgraduate research in 
economics at the Sorbonne. In 1956 he gained a job in the 
economics directorate of NATO, whose headquarters 
were then on the outskirts of Paris. Over the next five 
years Hambleton handed over what his KGB file 
describes as “a huge quantity of documents,” most of 
which were assessed by the Centre as “valuable or 
extremely valuable in content.”^^ Though Brik was 
unaware of his existence, Hambleton was eventually 
betrayed twenty years later by another Soviet illegal. 

Early in 1955, probably as part of its preparations to 



transfer Brik to the United States, the Centre made plans 
to move another illegal resident, codenamed ZHANGO, 
to Canada. ZHANGO was a 49-year-old Russian, Mikhail 
Ivanovich Filonenko, who had been given the genuine 
birth certificate, and had assumed the identity, of Joseph 
Ivanovich Kulda. Bom on July 7, 1914 in Alliance, Ohio, 
Kulda had emigrated to Czechoslovakia with his parents 
in 1922. Filonenko ’s wife, Anna Fyodorovna (codenamed 
successively MARTA and YELENA), took the identity of 
Mariya Navotnaya, a Czech bom on October 10, 1920 in 
Manchuria. Anna was Czech on her father’s side; before 
marrying Filonenko she had spent two years in 
Czechoslovakia perfecting her grasp of the language and 
improving her legend. Posing as Czechoslovak refugees, 
the Filonenkos were initially unsuccessful in their 
applications for Canadian visas, but with the help of the 
UN Refugees Commission (later the UNHCR) gained 
entry to Brazil in 1954.^^ In 1955 the Centre made plans 
to move Filonenko on to join Brik in Canada, where he 
was to have the new codename HECTOR. Brik duly 
informed the RCMP of HECTOR’S planned arrival.^^ 

The KGB was saved in the nick of time from a major 
intelligence disaster, which, it believed, would have 
included the arrest and show trial of Filonenko, by a 
walk-in to the Ottawa residency. On July 21, 1955 a 
heavily indebted 39-year-old RCMP corporal, James 
Morrison, who for some years had taken part in 
surveillance of the Ottawa embassy, got in touch with 



Burdin’s successor as resident, Nikolai Pavlovich 
Ostrovsky (codenamed GOLUBEV), and reported that 
Brik had been “turned” eighteen months earlier. He was 
acting, he claimed, out of sympathy for the USSR and a 
desire to prevent a repetition of the Gouzenko affair 
which had done so much damage to Soviet-Canadian 
relations ten years earlier. Morrison’s request for 5,000 
dollars, however, provides a better indication of his 
motives. Unknown to Ostrovsky, he had already been 
caught embezzling RCMP funds with which he hoped to 
pay off the debts caused by his taste for high living. 
Remarkably, instead of being sacked, Morrison was 
allowed to refund the money he had stolen. Ironically, he 
was to use money from the KGB to repay the RCMP.^^ 
The Centre initially suspected that the intelligence from 
Morrison (later code-named FRIEND) was an elaborate 
“provocation” by the RCMP, but decided to interrogate 
Brik in Moscow. Fortunately for the KGB, it had already 
been decided in June that Brik would travel to the Soviet 
Union for a holiday and reunite with his wife later in the 
summer. Though understandably nervous at the thought 
of returning to Moscow, he appears to have been 
confident of his ability to continue to outwit the KGB.^^ 
Before leaving Canada, Brik was briefed by Charles 
Sweeny of the RCMP and Leslie Mitchell, the SIS liaison 
officer in Washington, and asked to find out what he 
could about the fate of Burgess and Maclean, as well as to 



identify as many KGB officers as possible during his 
visit. They told him that if he needed assistance in 
Moscow it would be provided by the British SIS, since 
Canada had no foreign intelligence service. He was given 
details of one rendezvous point with an SIS officer, the 
location of two dead letter-boxes and signal sites to 
indicate when a DLB had been filled. If it became 
necessary to arrange an escape, SIS would leave in a DLB 
a short-wave radio, money, a pistol with silencer, false 
Soviet passports for himself and his wife, the internal 
travel documents needed to go to the town of Pechenga 
near the Soviet-Norwegian border and a map showing 
where to cross the frontier.^ ^ 

The Centre took great care not to arouse Brik’s 
suspicions before his departure. His first stop, arranged in 
June, was in Brazil, where he was due to meet Filonenko 
(HECTOR) on August 7. Filonenko was warned not to 
attend the meeting, but the prearranged rendezvous was 
kept under KGB observation. When Brik arrived on 
August 7, the KGB watchers reported that he had two 
companions, thus providing strong circumstantial 
evidence that he was now a double agent. Apparently 
undeterred by Filonenko ’s failure to meet him, Brik 
continued to Moscow via Paris and Helsinki. The 
residents in both capitals were ordered to give him a 
friendly welcome and discuss with him the travel 
arrangements for his return to Canada. A KGB strong-arm 
man was, however, sent to Finland in case Brik had any 



last-minute doubts about going to Moscow. If necessary, a 
Soviet agent in the Finnish police agreed to arrange for 
his expulsion to the Soviet Union.^^ 

On August 19, 1955 Brik arrived at Moscow airport 
and was immediately arrested. He at first denied that he 
was a double agent, but his file records that he 
subsequently broke under “pressure” and “told all.”^^ His 
confession confirmed everything reported to the Ottawa 
residency by James Morrison (FRIEND), who was then 
paid the 5,000 dollars he had asked for. Morrison 
volunteered for further payment what the Centre 
considered “valuable” information about the organization, 
personnel and operations of the RCMP and, in particular, 
its security service.^^ 

On September 4, 1956, at a closed session of the 
Military Collegium of the Supreme Court, Brik was 
sentenced to fifteen years in prison. The fact that he 
escaped the death penalty was presumably due to his 
cooperation in what his file describes as “an operational 
game.” Brik was not allowed to meet any member of the 
SIS station in the Moscow embassy, probably for fear that 
he would blurt out what had happened to him, but 
instructed to arrange a rendezvous which he did not keep. 
By keeping the rendezvous site under surveillance, the 
KGB was able to identify Daphne (later Baroness) Park, 
the member of the British embassy who turned up there, 
as an SIS officer. During the “operational game” Brik was 



allowed to live at home with his family in order to try to 
give SIS the impression that he was still at liberty. The 
KGB discovered, probably by bugging his apartment, that 
he tried unsuccessfully to persuade his wife to flee 
abroad.^^ 

Morrison continued for three years to work as a Soviet 
agent. Including the 5,000 dollars he received for 
betraying Brik, he was paid a total of 14,000 dollars by 
the KGB. The Centre, however, became increasingly 
dissatisfied with the quality of the information he 
supplied. In September 1955 Morrison was posted to 
Winnipeg as part of a unit investigating drug smuggling 
from the United States, and lost much of his previous 
access to RCMP intelligence. His last meeting with a 
Soviet controller took place on December 7, 1957. 
Morrison asked for help in paying off a debt of 4,800 
dollars. The deputy resident in Ottawa, Rem Sergeevich 
Krasilnikov (ARTUR), however, paid him only 150 
dollars and told him that he would need to arrange a 
transfer to Ottawa and get better access to RCMP 
intelligence if he wished to earn more money. Morrison 
failed to turn up to his next pre-arranged meeting with 
Krasilnikov and broke off further contact with the KGB. 
In 1958 the Ottawa residency discovered from press 
reports that Morrison had been dismissed from the RCMP 
and given a two-year suspended sentence for fraud.^^ 

Though Morrison’s warning in 1955 had helped to 
contain the damage done to KGB operations by Brik’s 



twenty-one months as a double agent, that damage was 
none the less considerable. The Centre was forced to 
abandon its plan for a second illegal residency in the 
United States based on Brik and Filonenko. In addition to 
betraying five KGB agents, Brik had also identified to the 
RCMP a number of KGB officers in the Ottawa legal 
residency, all of whom were withdrawn from Canada.^^ 

ANOTHER PLAN BY the Centre to establish a further 
illegal residency in the United States also collapsed in the 
mid-1950s. The intended illegal resident was Vladimir 
Vasilyevich Grinchenko (codenamed RON and KLOD), 
who had taken the identity of Jan Bechko, the son of a 
Slovak father and a Ukrainian mother. Since 1948 
Grinchenko and his wife, Simona Isaakovna Krimker 
(codenamed MIRA), had been based in Buenos Aires, 
where in 1951 they had gained Argentinian citizenship. In 
1954 the Centre planned to transfer them to the United 
States. At the last moment, however, it was discovered 
that the FBI had obtained Grinchenko ’s fingerprints while 
he was working as an agent on a Soviet ship visiting 
North America. Grinchenko was hurriedly redeployed to 
France, where, a few months later, his career as an illegal 
was ended by what his file describes as “a gross breach of 
security.” In August 1955 his Argentinian passport, 
French residence permit, student card and expense 
account were all stolen from his hotel room in Paris. So 
was the photograph of, and a letter in Russian from. 



another KGB illegal codenamed BORIS. Both 
Grinchenko and BORIS were hurriedly recalled to 
Moscow.^^ 

Though the Centre did not yet realize it, its one 
established American residency was by now also in 
trouble. Unlike Makayev (HARRY), Brik (HART) and 
Grinchenko (KLOD), “Willie” Fisher (MARK), the 
illegal resident in New York, was a paragon of both self- 
discipline and ideological dedication.^^ His chief 
assistant, Reino Hayhanen, however, was to prove even 
less reliable than Brik. 

Hayhanen had taken the identity of a “live double,” 
Eugene Nikolai Maki, who had been bom in the United 
States in 1919 to a Finnish- American father and a New 
York mother, and at the age of eight had emigrated with 
his parents to the Finnish- speaking Soviet Republic of 
Karelia. In 1938 Maki had been arrested on suspicion of 
espionage but had been released, given the codename 
DAVID and employed by the Interior Ministry to inform 
on the families of other Karelian victims of the Terror. In 
1949 Maki surrendered his birth certificate to Hayhanen, 
who spent most of the next three years in Finland taking 
over Maki’s identity with the help of a Finnish 
Communist, Olavi Ahman, who had been recmited as a 
Soviet agent in 1939.^^ 

On October 20, 1952 Hayhanen, now codenamed VIK, 
arrived in New York on board the Queen Mary, and spent 



most of the next two years establishing his new identity, 
collecting his salary from dead letter-boxes in the Bronx 
and Manhattan and periodically drawing attention to 
himself by heavy drinking and violent quarrels with his 
Finnish wife Hannah.^ ^ The Centre, doubtless unaware of 
Hayhanen’s disorderly behavior, sent him congratulations 
on his “safe arrival” in a microfilm message hidden inside 
a hollowed-out nickel. Like Makayev a year or so earlier, 
Hayhanen mislaid the nickel, which in the summer of 
1953 was used, possibly by Hayhanen himself, to buy a 
newspaper from a Brooklyn newsboy. The newsboy 
accidentally dropped the nickel in a stairway and was 
amazed to see it break in two and a minute microfilm drop 
out. He handed both the coin and the microfilm to the 
New York police, who passed them on to the FBI. 
Though it was some years before the number groups in 
the microfilm message could be decrypted, the fact that 
they had been typed on a Cyrillic typewriter helped to 
alert the Bureau to the presence in New York of a Soviet 
illegal. It is highly unlikely that VIK informed the 
Centre that the coin and microfilm were missing. 

In the summer of 1954 Hayhanen at last began work as 
Fisher’s assistant. One of his first tasks was to deliver a 
report from a Soviet agent in the United Nations 
secretariat in New York, a French economist codenamed 
ORIZO, to a dead letter-box for collection by the New 
York legal residency. ORIZO ’s report probably 
concerned two American nuclear physicists whom he had 



been instructed to cultivate. The report, however, never 
arrived. Doubtless alarmed at this breach of security, 
ORIZO asked to stop working for the KGB, but was 
ultimately persuaded to carry on.^^ 

Though disturbed by the weakness of Hayhanen’s 
tradecraft, Fisher failed to grasp that he was an alcoholic 
fraudster who posed a serious threat to the future of his 
residency. During a visit to Bear Mountain Park in the 
spring of 1955, Fisher and Hayhanen buried 5,000 dollars 
which Hayhanen was later supposed to deliver to the wife 
of Morton Sobell, a convicted Soviet spy and member of 
the Rosenberg spy ring, who had been sentenced to thirty 
years in jail. Hayhanen later reported, ‘T located Helen 
Sobell and gave her the money and told her to spend it 
carefully.” In fact, he kept the 5,000 dollars for himself. 

Early in 1956 the police were called to the home of the 
“Makis” home at Peekskill in Hudson Valley, where they 
found both Hayhanen and his wife drunk; Hayhanen had a 
deep knife wound in his leg, which he claimed was the 
result of an accident. Later that year he was found guilty 
of drunken driving and had his license suspended. In 
January 1957 Hayhanen was due to return to Moscow on 
leave. Initially, he could not bring himself to go, 
fabricating a series of stories to justify his delay. He first 
told Fisher that he was being tailed by three men, then 
claimed that the FBI had taken him off the Queen Mary, 
on which he had booked a passage. The unsuspecting 



Fisher told Hayhanen to leave the country as soon as 
possible to escape FBI surveillance and gave him 200 
dollars for his travel expenses. On April 24 Hayhanen set 
sail aboard La Liberte for France. Arriving in Paris on 
May Day, he made contact with the KGB residency and 
was given another 200 dollars to complete his journey to 
Moscow. Four days later, instead of returning to Russia, 
he entered the American embassy in Paris, announced that 
he was a KGB officer and began to tell his story. 

Though the KGB did not discover the defection until 
August, it warned Fisher, probably in late May or early 
June, that Hayhanen had failed to arrive in Moscow, and 
instructed him as a precaution to leave the United States, 
using a new set of identity documents. Fisher disobeyed 
his orders and stayed. He was arrested early on the 
morning of June 21 while staying in a New York hotel on 
East 28th Street and flown to the Alien Detention Facility 
in McAllen, Texas, for questioning.^^ After a few days 
spent stonewalling his questioners Fisher finally admitted 
that he was a Russian who had been living under false 
identities in the United States, and gave as his real name 
that of a deceased friend and KGB colleague, Rudolf 
Ivanovich Abel. The Centre, Fisher knew, would realize 
what had happened as soon as it saw the name Abel on 
the front pages of the American newspapers.^^ 


FISHER’S ARREST MARKED a major strategic defeat 



for KGB operations against the Main Adversary. The 
Centre’s early Cold War strategy in the United States had 
been based on the creation of an illegal network which 
would run major agents such as Hall and Philby, and 
eventually penetrate the administration to approximately 
the level achieved during the Great Patriotic War. Fisher’s 
failure, however, appears to have left the KGB without a 
single illegal residency in the United States. Instead of 
adopting a more realistic strategy with far more limited 
aims, the Centre persisted with its plan to revive the era of 
the Great Illegals and blamed its initial failure on a series 
of operational errors. 

The Centre’s investigations of the cases of Makayev 
(HARRY), Brik (HART) and Hayhanen (VIK) all 
revealed flaws in the selection of the first generation of 
Cold War illegals. Hayhanen’ s file in the KGB archives 
contains many warning signs which should have been 
evident well before he was despatched to the United 
States in 1952. In both the Soviet Union and Finland he 
had a record for getting into debt and borrowing money, 
as well as for unusually complicated sexual liaisons. 
Though already married in the Soviet Union, Hayhanen 
entered into a bigamous marriage in Finland — ^without 
informing the Centre beforehand — with Hannah Kurikka, 
with whom he later lived in the United States. The report 
on Hayhanen prepared for the leadership of the KI in 
1949, however, glossed over his character weaknesses 
and insisted that his operational failings would be 



rectified during training. Mitrokhin noted after reading 
Hayhanen’s file in the KGB archives: 


It was obvious that the KGB wanted to keep VIK in 
intelligence work no matter what, regardless of signs 
that he was in trouble, because they did not want to 
expose any of their operations, because the training 
of a replacement would be difficult and time- 
consuming, and because they regretted wasting so 
much time and money on VIK.^^ 

Hayhanen’s Russian wife was informed of his 
defection, divorced him and went back to her maiden 
name, Moiseyeva. In 1957 the chairman of the KGB 
received a letter from a woman named M. M. Gridina 
asking for news of Hayhanen, who, she said, was the 
father of her 12-year-old son. The KGB was less frank 
with Gridina than with Moiseyeva. She was told that the 
KGB had never employed Hayhanen and did not know 
his whereabouts, but had heard rumors that he had 
committed a serious crime against the Soviet state and 
was wanted by the police. Gridina replied that she would 
tell her son that his father had been killed fighting the 
Germans during the Great Patriotic War.^^ In fact, 
Hayhanen died in the United States in 1961. At the time it 
was alleged that he had been killed in a car accident on 
the Pennsylvania turnpike; in reality he seems to have 
died from cirrhosis of the liver.^^ 



On November 15, 1957 the 55-year-old “Rudolf Abel” 
was sentenced to thirty years in jail. His American lawyer, 
James Donovan, was struck by “Abel’s” “uncanny calm” 
as he listened to what was, in effect, a life sentence: “This 
cool professional’s self-control was just too much for 
me. ”64 “Abel’s” wife, Ilya, who had last seen her husband 
when he returned on leave to Moscow in the summer of 
1955, made less attempt to disguise her feelings. She 
wrote bitterly to the Centre that it was not simply a 
question of waiting for twenty-five or thirty years but “I 
do not know if my husband will ever return.” For the past 
seven years she had worked as a harpist in a circus 
orchestra; however, when she criticized the KGB after her 
husband was jailed, she was made redundant on the 
pretext that the orchestra no longer needed a harpist. The 
Centre rejected Ilya “Abel’s” pleas for help in finding 
another job, but granted her a pension of 51 roubles a 
month. 

At Atlanta Penitentiary, in Georgia, where “Rudolf 
Abel” had been sent to serve his sentence, he became 
friends with two other convicted Soviet spies. He played 
chess with Morton Sobell, whose wife had failed to 
receive the 5,000 dollars embezzled by Hayhanen.^^ 
“Abel” also received a number of small favors from Kurt 
Ponger, an Austrian-bom American in the penitentiary’s 
dental section who had been sentenced in 1953 to a term 
of five to fifteen years’ imprisonment for conspiracy to 



commit espionage while serving in the US army in 
Austria. Ponger’s file in the KGB archives reveals that he 
had been a Soviet agent since 1936, but that after his 
arrest the Centre had wrongly concluded that he was a 
double agent whose arrest had been deliberately staged by 
the Americans in order to discredit the Soviet Union in 
Austrian public opinion. “Abel” had no doubt that Ponger 
was a genuine Soviet agent and later tried to persuade the 
KGB to give Ponger financial assistance after he was 
freed in September 1962.^^ 

“Abel” served only just over four years of his sentence. 
On February 10, 1962 he was exchanged on the 
Glienicker Bridge, which linked West Berlin with 
Potsdam, for the shot-down American U-2 pilot Gary 
Powers. The exchange was treated by the KGB as a 
major operation, codenamed LYUTENTSIA, coordinated 
by Vladimir Trofimovich Burdin, the former resident in 
Ottawa. An undercover KGB group was stationed in West 
Berlin to watch for signs of American military activity in 
the area of the bridge. On the bridge itself, hidden in the 
offices of the East German Customs Service, was a KGB 
armed operational group. Close at hand, but also out of 
view from the Western side of the bridge, was another 
armed group which had accompanied Powers from 
Potsdam for the exchange. At the Soviet checkpoint, a 
specially trained officer from the 105th Regiment was put 
in command of a detail of submachine gunners. The East 
Germans provided a reserve unit of twenty men armed 



with submachine guns and grenades. 

The Centre congratulated itself on the fact that its 
absurdly large, concealed military presence had gone 
almost unobserved. “Abel’s” lawyer was more 
impressed by the fact that the American guard who 
accompanied his client on to the bridge was “one of the 
largest men I have ever seen. He must have been six feet 
seven inches tall and weighed perhaps three hundred 
pounds.”^ ^ After the exchange of “Abel” for Powers, the 
Glienicker Bridge became famous during the Cold War as 
the “Bridge of Spies.” The KGB file on operation 
LYUTENTSIA records that its total nonmilitary cost 
(food, train tickets, hotel bills, various items for “Abel” 
and his wife and daughter, and a celebration dinner) came 
to 5,388 marks 90 pfennigs. Walter Ulbricht, the East 
German leader, did not share the Centre’s satisfaction at 
the success of the operation. He complained to the Soviet 
ambassador, Pervukhin, on February 15 that his 
government had not been adequately informed and that 
the failure to include East German police among Powers’s 
escort showed lack of respect for the sovereignty of the 
German Democratic Republic. Ulbricht followed his 
verbal protest with a diplomatic note citing other Soviet 
slights.^^ 

In the United States, “Abel’s” paintings and prints 
became collectors’ items. The Attorney-General, Robert 
Kennedy, asked the Soviet embassy to find out whether 



“Abel” would be willing to give the US government a 
portrait of his brother, President Kennedy, which he had 
painted in Atlanta Penitentiary, and allow it to be hung in 
the White House. The Centre suspected a plot. The 
proposal to display “Abel’s” portrait in the White House 
was, it believed, a provocation, though it was not certain 
what exactly it was intended to provoke. Robert 
Kennedy’s request was turned down.^^ 

“Abel” received an unpublicized hero’s welcome on his 
return to Moscow, being received in turn by Vladimir 
Yefimovich Semichastny, chairman of the KGB, 
Aleksandr Mikhailovich Sakharovsky, head of the KGB 
First Chief (Foreign Intelligence) Directorate, and General 
Pyotr Ivashutin, head of the GRU.^^ At Semichastny’ s 
prompting, “Abel” wrote to Khrushchev to thank him 
personally for the supposed part he had taken in securing 
his release: “... I am especially touched by the fact that, 
amidst the great variety of your Party and governmental 
concerns, you found the time to think about me as well.” 

Though it suited the Centre, for the sake of its own 
reputation in the Party hierarchy, to portray “Abel’s” 
mission to the United States as an operational triumph by 
a dedicated Chekist, brought to a premature conclusion 
only by an act of treachery for which he bore no 
responsibility, it was well aware that in reality he had 
achieved nothing of real significance. He had been 
arrested in 1957 only because he had disobeyed 
instructions to leave the country after Hayhanen had 



failed to return to MoscowJ^ 

The Centre took advantage of the fact that “Abel” was 
portrayed in the American media as a master spy of heroic 
stature. That impression was strengthened by the 
sympathetic portrayal of him in Strangers on a Bridge, an 
account by his lawyer of his trial, imprisonment and 
exchange for Powers published in 1964. Donovan made 
clear that he “admired Rudolf as an individual,” and 
quoted Allen Dulles, Director of Central Intelligence from 
1953 to 1961, as telling him, “I wish we had three or four 
just like him in Moscow right now ...” He ended his book 
by printing a letter “Abel” had sent him from Moscow, 
enclosing two rare, sixteenth-century, vellum-bound Latin 
editions of Commentaries on the Justinian Code. “Please 
accept them,” “Abel” wrote, “as a mark of my gratitude 
for all that you have done for me.”^^ 

All this was music to the Centre’s ears.^^ The myth of 
the master spy Rudolf Abel replaced the pedestrian reality 
of Fisher’s illegal residency. The inconvenient lack of 
heroic exploits to celebrate was glossed over by the 
assurance that, though there were many of them, they 
remained too secret to celebrate in public. The real 
“Willie” Fisher, however, became increasingly 
disillusioned. After his return to Moscow, he was given a 
chair in a comer of the FCD Illegals Directorate but was 
denied even a desk of his own. When a friend asked him 
what he did, he replied disconsolately, “I’m a museum 



exhibit.’ 



ELEVEN 


THE MAIN ADVERSARY 


Part 2: Walk-ins and Legal Residencies in the Early Cold 

War 


The KGB’s chief successes against the Main Adversary 
during the presidencies of Dwight D. Eisenhower (1953- 
61) and John F. Kennedy (1961-3) derived not from its 
grand strategy for new illegal residencies, which 
collapsed for several years after FISHER’ s arrest, but 
from a series of walk-ins. The most important was 
probably a CIA “principal agent” in West Berlin and 
Germany, Alexsandr (“Sasha”) Grigoryevich Kopatzky, 
alias “Koischwitz” (successively codenamed ERWIN, 
HERBERT and RICHARD), who had offered himself for 
recruitment by Soviet intelligence in 1949.^ Trained by 
the KGB in secret writing and microphotography, he was 
paid a total of 40,000 West German and 2,117 East 



German marks during the 1950s, as well as being 
rewarded for his success with several gold watches.^ 

Kopatzky was employed at one of the focal points of 
American intelligence operations. The CIA’s West Berlin 
station was situated only a few miles from the greatest 
concentration of Soviet forces anywhere in the world. 
One of Kopatzky ’s chief tasks was to find East German 
women willing to have sex with Soviet soldiers and act as 
CIA agents. By taking an active part in the station’s 
attempt to recruit Soviet personnel and encourage 
defections, he was able to find numerous opportunities to 
sabotage its operations. Among the wealth of intelligence 
which Kopatzky provided were the identities of more than 
a hundred American intelligence officers and agents in 
East Germany; some were arrested while others were 
turned into double agents. He also assisted a number of 
KGB operations to “dangle” bogus agents intended to 
deceive the CIA station. In 1952 he helped to organize the 
bogus defection of Soviet agent VIKTOR, who was later 
employed by the Voice of America radio station and 
supplied what Kopatzky’ s file terms “valuable 
information.”^ 

After Kopatzky was briefly imprisoned for drunken 
driving in 1954, his name was changed by the CIA to 
“Igor Orlov,” so that his criminal record would not appear 
on his application for US citizenship.^ In 1957, with his 
cover as a CIA (but not Soviet) agent largely blown in 



Berlin, Orlov was taken to Washington with his family 
and given further operational training by the Agency. He 
then returned to Europe to take part in various CIA 
operations in Germany and Austria.^ In I960 the CIA at 
last began to suspect that “Orlov” was working for the 
KGB. A later damage assessment at the Centre concluded 
that the extraordinary number of KGB officers who had 
been in direct contact with him — over twenty during the 
last decade — might have helped to place him under 
suspicion.^ In order to prevent Orlov defecting before the 
case against him had been established, the CIA promised 
him a new job with the Agency in Washington, sacked 
him on his arrival in January 1961 and began an intensive 
investigation.^ Orlov made contact with his new Soviet 
controller, I. P. Sevastyanov, an operations officer at the 
Washington residency, got a job as a truck driver and 
heard nothing for several years from either the CIA or the 
FBI. In 1964 he bought a picture-framing gallery in 
Alexandria, Virginia, paid for in part, no doubt, by his 
earnings from the KGB.^ 

By the time he opened his gallery, Orlov may well have 
felt confident that the case against him could never be 
proved. His confidence evaporated in the spring of 1965 
when the FBI arrived on his doorstep, spent several days 
searching his home, questioned his wife Eleonore and 
summoned him to take a polygraph test. Orlov seems to 
have panicked. Under surveillance and unable to make 



covert contact with the KGB, he went into the Soviet 
embassy on 1 6th Street through a rear door, vainly hoping 
to enter unobserved.^ The Washington residency arranged 
with him an exfiltration plan which was agreed to by 
Moscow. Encouraged by “Abel’s” star rating as a master 
spy and his American lawyer’s affectionate memoir of 
him, the Centre intended to turn the exfiltration into a 
publicity stunt. It planned a press conference in Moscow 
at which Orlov would be presented as a Soviet illegal who 
had performed heroic deeds behind the German lines on 
the eastern front during the Second World War and later 
penetrated the CIA. Orlov would then publish his life 
story, which would be used as an “active measure” to 
glamorize the KGB and denigrate its Main Adversary. 

The plan, however, had to be called off. Orlov’s wife 
flatly refused to go to Moscow with their two young sons, 
so he decided to tough it out in Washington. Though the 
FBI kept the “Orlov” file open, they were never able to 
prove a case against him. Their investigation, like that of 
the CIA, however, was based on one false assumption. 
After his defection in December 1961, KGB Major 
Anatoli Golitsyn had provided some clues which helped 
to confirm suspicions about Orlov. Golitsyn correctly said 
that a Soviet spy whose real surname began with a K had 
been active in Berlin and West Germany, but wrongly 
said that his codename, rather than his real name, was 
SASHA. The CIA and FBI both wrongly concluded that 



Aleksandr (“Sasha”) Kopatzky, alias “Igor Orlov,” was 
agent SASHA. Orlov’s KGB file shows that he was at 
various stages of his career successively ERWIN, 
HERBERT and RICHARD, but never SASHA, and that 
he remained a Soviet agent until a few years before his 
death in 1982. After a press article in 1978 claimed that 
Orlov was a Soviet spy, the KGB broke off contact with 
RICHARD. In 1992, ten years after Orlov’s death, the 
Gallery Orlov, run by his widow, was still described by a 
Washington guide as “a hangout for espionage writers. 

West Berlin and West Germany, where Kopatzky (aka 
Orlov) had first offered his services to the KGB in 1949, 
were the KGB’s most successful recruiting grounds for 
disgruntled US military personnel. The most important 
was probably Robert Lee Johnson, codenamed GEORGE, 
a disaffected army sergeant and part-time pimp in West 
Berlin. In 1953 Johnson and his prostitute fiancee, 
Hedy, crossed into East Berlin and asked for political 
asylum. The KGB, however, persuaded Johnson to stay in 
the West, earn a second salary by spying for the Soviet 
Union and pay off his old scores against the US army. 
Despite his involvement in prostitution, alcohol abuse and 
gambling (not to mention espionage), Johnson succeeded 
in gaining employment as a guard from 1957 to 1959 at 
missile sites in California and Texas, where he purloined 
documents, photographs and, on one occasion, a sample 
of rocket fuel for the KGB.^^ 



Johnson’s most productive period as a Soviet agent 
began in 1961 when he was stationed as a guard in the US 
Armed Forces Courier Centre at Orly Airport, near Paris, 
one of the main nerve centers in the classified military 
communications system. Over the next two years he 
handed over 1,600 pages of top secret documents to his 
controller. Among them were ciphers and daily key-tables 
for the Adonis, KW-9 and HW-18 cipher machines; the 
operational plans of the US armed forces command in 
Europe; documents on the production of American 
nuclear weapons; lists and locations of targets in the 
Soviet Bloc; US intelligence reports on Soviet scientific 
research, aviation and missile development; and SIGINT 
evidence on the state of readiness of the East German Air 
Force. Collectively the documents provided an 
extraordinary and highly classified insight both into 
American forces in Europe and into what they knew about 
the forces of the Warsaw Pact.^^ Johnson was finally 
arrested in 1964 after a tip-off from the KGB defector 
Yuri Nosenko.^^ 

IN THE UNITED STATES itself the most remarkable 
KGB walk-ins during the Eisenhower presidency were 
two employees of the National Security [SIGINT] 
Agency, 31 -year-old Bemon F. Mitchell and 29-year-old 
William H. Martin. On September 6, 1960, in Moscow’s 
House of Journalists, Mitchell and Martin gave perhaps 
the most embarrassing press conference in the history of 



the American intelligence community. The greatest 
embarrassment was the public revelation that NS A had 
been decrypting the communications of some of the 
United States’ allies. Among them, said Martin, were 
“Italy, Turkey, France, Yugoslavia, the United Arab 
Republic [Egypt and Syria], Indonesia, Uruguay — that’s 
enough to give a general picture, I guess.” 

Though the defection of the two NS A employees was a 
spectacular publicity coup, Mitchell’s KGB file reveals 
that it fell some way short of the Centre’s expectations.^^ 
Somewhat surprisingly, Mitchell had been recruited by 
NS A in 1957 despite admitting to six years of “sexual 
experimentations” up to the age of nineteen with dogs and 
chickens. His gifts as a mathematician were presumably 
thought more important than his farmyard experiences. 
During Martin’s positive vetting, acquaintances variously 
described him as irresponsible and an insufferable egotist 
but — like his friend Mitchell — a gifted mathematician. 
Politically naive and socially inadequate, Mitchell and 
Martin were seduced by the Soviet propaganda image of 
the USSR as a state committed to the cause of peace 
whose progressive social system could offer them the 
personal fulfillment they had failed to find in the United 
States.^ ^ 

In December 1959, Mitchell flew from Washington to 
Mexico City, in defiance of NS A regulations, entered the 
Soviet embassy and asked for political asylum in the 



USSR, giving ideological reasons as the motive for his 
action.^^ The KGB residency made strenuous attempts to 
persuade him to stay on inside NS A as a defector- in- 
place, but without success. Mitchell agreed to a secret 
meeting with another KGB officer in Washington but 
maintained his insistence on emigrating to the Soviet 
Union with Martin. Once there, however, he promised to 
reveal all he knew about NS A. 

On June 25, 1960, at the beginning of three weeks’ 
summer leave, Mitchell and Martin boarded Eastern 
Airlines flight 307 at Washington National Airport, bound 
for New Orleans. There, after a brief stopover, they took 
another flight for Mexico City, stayed the night at the 
Hotel Virreyes, then caught a Cubana Airlines plane to 
Havana.^^ In July they were exfiltrated from Cuba to the 
Soviet Union. KGB codebreakers were disappointed in 
the amount of detailed knowledge of NS A cryptanalysis 
possessed by Mitchell and Martin. Their most important 
intelligence, in the Centre’s view, was the reassurance 
they were able to provide on NSA’s lack of success in 
breaking current high-grade Soviet ciphers.^^ However, 
the KGB similarly remained unable to decrypt high-grade 
US cipher sy stems. 

Security was so lax at NSA’s Fort Meade headquarters 
that no attempt was made to track Mitchell and Martin 
down until eight days after they had been due to return 
from their three- week vacation. Inside Mitchell’s house 



NS A security officers found the key to a safe deposit box, 
which Mitchell had deliberately left for them to find. 
Inside the box in a nearby bank they found a sealed 
envelope bearing a request, signed by both Mitchell and 
Martin, that its contents be made public. The envelope 
contained a lengthy denunciation of the US government 
and the evils of capitalism and a bizarre eulogy of life in 
the Soviet Union, including the claim that its emancipated 
women were “more desirable as mates. 

By decision no. 295 of the Communist Party of the 
Soviet Union, dated August 11, 1960, Mitchell and 
Martin were given political asylum and monthly 
allowances of 500 roubles each — about the same as their 
NS A salaries and well above Soviet salary scales. In the 
autumn Mitchell was given a job in the Institute of 
Mathematics at Leningrad University; Martin began 
doctoral research at the same institute. Both defectors 
quickly put their beliefs about the desirability of Soviet 
mates to the test. Mitchell married Galina Vladimirovna 
Yakovleva, a 30-year-old assistant professor in the piano 
music department of the Leningrad Conservatory. Martin, 
who changed his name to Sokolovsky, married a Russian 
woman whom he met on holiday on the Black Sea.^^ 

Within a few years the Centre found both Mitchell and 
Martin considerably more trouble than they were worth. 
Predictably, both defectors rapidly became disillusioned 
with life in the Soviet Union. Martin, whom the Centre 



regarded as the more impressionable of the two, was 
gullible enough to believe a tale concocted by the KGB 
that they had both been sentenced in absentia to twenty 
years’ hard labor by a closed session of the US Supreme 
Court. He was eventually shown a bogus copy of the 
judgment in order to persuade him to put all thought of 
returning home out of his mind. Mitchell was more 
skeptical and by the 1970s appeared determined to leave. 
As chairman of the KGB, Yuri Andropov gave personal 
instructions that under no circumstances was either 
Mitchell or Martin to be allowed to go, for fear of 
deterring other potential defectors from the West. In a 
further attempt to deter Martin he was shown an article by 
Yuri Semyonov in Izvestia claiming that American agents 
had been found in possession of poison ampoules, and 
was led to believe that these were intended for Mitchell 
and himself. Mitchell correctly suspected that the story 
had been fabricated by the KGB. Galina Mitchell was also 
anxious to leave, but the KGB put pressure on her mother 
to persuade Galina to change her mind. After their 
applications for visas had been rebuffed by Australia, 
New Zealand, Sweden and Switzerland, as well as the 
United States, the Mitchells told the Soviet authorities on 
March 29, 1980 that they had given up their attempts to 
emigrate.^^ But there were persistent reports afterwards 
that Mitchell was still trying to leave. 


FOR MOST OF the Cold War, the Washington and New 



York legal residencies had little success in providing the 
intelligence from inside the federal government which had 
been so plentiful during the Second World War. Their 
limitations were clearly exposed during the two years 
before the most dangerous moment of the Cold War, the 
Cuban missile crisis of 1962. 

The vacuum left by the lack of KGB high-grade 
political intelligence from the United States was partly 
filled by dangerous nonsense from elsewhere, some of 
which reflected the paranoid strain in Soviet analysis. On 
June 29, 1960 the KGB chairman, Aleksandr 

Nikolayevich Shelepin, personally delivered to 
Khrushchev an alarmist assessment of American policy, 
based on a misinformed report from an unidentified 
NATO liaison officer with the CIA: 

In the CIA it is known that the leadership of the 
Pentagon is convinced of the need to initiate a war 
with the Soviet Union “as soon as possible” ... Right 
now the USA has the capability to wipe out Soviet 
missile bases and other military targets with its 
bomber forces. But over the next little while the 
defense forces of the Soviet Union will grow ... and 
the opportunity will disappear ... As a result of these 
assumptions, the chiefs at the Pentagon are hoping to 
launch a preventive war against the Soviet Union. 

Khrushchev took the warning seriously. Less than a 



fortnight later he issued a public warning to the Pentagon 
“not to forget that, as shown at the latest tests, we have 
rockets which can land in a pre-set square target 13,000 
kilometers away.”^^ 

Moscow followed the presidential elections of 1960 
with close attention. Khrushchev regarded the Republican 
candidate, Richard Nixon, as a McCarthyite friend of the 
Pentagon hawks, and was anxious that Kennedy should 
win. The Washington resident, Aleksandr Semyonovich 
Feklisov (alias “Fomin”), was ordered to “propose 
diplomatic or propaganda initiatives, or any other 
measures, to facilitate Kennedy’s victory.” The residency 
tried to make contact with Robert Kennedy but was 
politely rebuffed. 

Khrushchev’s view of Kennedy changed after the 
CIA’s abortive and absurdly inept attempt to topple Fidel 
Castro by landing an American-backed “Cuban brigade” 
at the Bay of Pigs in April 1961. In the immediate 
aftermath of the Cuban debacle, Kennedy despairingly 
asked his special counsel, Theodore Sorensen, “How 
could I have been so stupid?”^^ The young president, 
Khrushchev concluded, was unable to control the “dark 
forces” of American capitalism’s military-industrial 
complex. At a summit meeting with Kennedy at Vienna 
in June, Khrushchev belligerently demanded an end to the 
three-power status of Berlin and a German peace treaty by 
the end of the year. The two superpowers seemed set on a 



collision course. Kennedy said afterwards to the journalist 
James Reston: 

I think [Khrushchev] did it because of the Bay of 
Pigs. I think he thought anyone who was so young 
and inexperienced as to get in that mess could be 
taken, and anyone who got into it and didn’t see it 

through had no guts. So he just beat the hell out of 

35 

me.^-^ 

On July 29, 1961 Shelepin sent Khrushchev the outline 
of a new and aggressive global grand strategy against the 
Main Adversary designed to “create circumstances in 
different areas of the world which would assist in 
diverting the attention and forces of the United States and 
its allies, and would tie them down during the settlement 
of the question of a German peace treaty and West 
Berlin’s proposal.” The first part of the plan was to use 
national liberation movements around the world to secure 
an advantage in the East- West struggle and to “activate by 
the means available to the KGB armed uprisings against 
pro- Western reactionary governments.” At the top of the 
list for demolition Shelepin placed “reactionary” regimes 
in the Main Adversary’s own backyard in Central 
America, beginning in Nicaragua where he proposed 
coordinating a “revolutionary front” in collaboration with 
the Cubans and the Sandinistas. Shelepin also proposed 
destabilizing NATO bases in western Europe and a 



disinformation campaign designed to demoralize the West 
by persuading it of the growing superiority of Soviet 
forces. On August 1, with only minor amendments, 
Shelepin’s masterplan was approved as a Central 
Committee directive.^^ Elements of it, especially the use 
of national liberation movements in the struggle with the 
Main Adversary, continued to reappear in Soviet strategy 
for the next quarter of a century. 

During the Kennedy administration, however, the role 
of the KGB in Washington was less important than that of 
the GRU. In May 1961 GRU Colonel Georgi Bolshakov, 
operating under cover as head of the Washington bureau 
of the Tass news agency, began fortnightly meetings with 
the Attorney-General, Robert Kennedy. Bolshakov 
succeeded in persuading Robert Kennedy that, between 
them, they could short-circuit the ponderous protocol of 
official diplomacy, “speak straightly and frankly without 
resorting to the politickers’ stock-in-trade propaganda 
stunts” and set up a direct channel of communication 
between President Kennedy and First Secretary 
Khrushchev. Forgetting that he was dealing with an 
experienced intelligence professional who had been 
instructed to cultivate him, the President’s brother became 
convinced that “an authentic friendship grew” between 
him and Bolshakov: 

Any time that he had some message to give to the 

President (or Khrushchev had) or when the President 



had some message to give to Khrushchev, we went 
through Georgi Bolshakov ... I met with him about 
all kinds of things. 

Despite Bolshakov’s success, GRU intelligence 
assessment of American policy was abysmal. In March 
1962 it produced two dangerously misinformed reports 
which served to reinforce the KGB’s earlier warning that 
the Pentagon was planning a nuclear first strike. The GRU 
claimed that in the previous June the United States had 
made the decision to launch a surprise nuclear attack on 
the Soviet Union in September 1961, but had been 
deterred at the last moment by Soviet nuclear tests which 
showed that the USSR’s nuclear arsenal was more 
powerful than the Pentagon had realized. The woefully 
inaccurate Soviet intelligence reports of Washington’s 
plans for thermonuclear warfare coincided with a series of 
real but farcically inept American attempts to topple or 
assassinate Moscow’s Cuban ally, Fidel Castro — actions 
ideally calculated to exacerbate the paranoid strain in 
Soviet foreign policy. 

In March 1962 Castro urged the KGB to set up an 
operations base in Havana to export revolution across 
Latin America. Then, in May, Khrushchev decided to 
construct nuclear missile bases in Cuba — the most 
dangerous gamble of the Cold War. He was partly 
motivated by his desire to impress Washington with 
Soviet nuclear might and so deter it from further (non- 



existent) plans for a first strike. At the same time he 
intended to make a dramatic gesture of support for the 
Cuban revolution. 

The Soviet gamble was taken in the belief that 
Washington would not detect the presence of the Cuban 
missile sites until it was too late to do anything about 
them. That belief was mistaken for two reasons. First, 
high-altitude U-2 spy planes were able to photograph the 
construction of the missile bases. Secondly, American 
intelligence analysts were able to make sense of the 
confusing U-2 photographs because they possessed plans 
of missile site construction and other important 
intelligence secretly supplied by Colonel Oleg 
Vladimirovich Penkovsky, a spy in the GRU run jointly 
by the British SIS and the CIA. All the main American 
intelligence reports on the Cuban bases during the missile 
crisis were later stamped IRONBARK, a codeword 
indicating that they had made use of Penkovsky’ s 
documents. 

As the construction of nuclear missile bases in Cuba 
began, Bolshakov continued to provide reassurance, 
probably as part of a deliberate deception strategy, that 
Khrushchev would never countenance such an aggressive 
policy. When U-2 spy planes revealed the existence of the 
bases in mid-October, while they were still in the course 
of construction, thus beginning the Cuban missile crisis, 
Robert Kennedy turned on Bolshakov. ‘T bet you know 
for certain that you have your missiles in Cuba,” he 



remonstrated. Bolshakov denied it. According to 
Sorensen, “President Kennedy had come to rely on the 
Bolshakov channel for direct private information from 
Khrushchev, and he felt personally deceived. He was 
personally deceived. 

At the moment in the Cold War when the Kremlin most 
urgently needed good intelligence from Washington, the 
KGB residency was unable to provide it. During the 
Second World War Soviet agents had penetrated every 
major branch of the Roosevelt administration. The Centre 
had been better informed on some important aspects of 
American policy (notably the MANHATTAN project) 
than Roosevelt’s vice-presidents or most members of his 
cabinets. During the Cuban missile crisis, by contrast, 
the Washington residency’s sources were limited to 
agents and contacts in the press corps and foreign 
embassies (especially those of Argentina and Nicaragua). 
Some of the intelligence which Feklisov, the resident, sent 
to Moscow was simply gossip. He had no source capable 
of penetrating the secret deliberations of EXCOMM, 
Kennedy’s closest advisers who assembled in the cabinet 
room on October 16 and met in daily session for the next 
thirteen days until the crisis was resolved. Aleksandr 
Sakharovsky, the head of the FCD, wrote dismissively on 
several of Feklisov’ s telegrams at the height of the missile 
crisis, “This report does not contain any secret 
information.”^^ 



The relative lack of influence of the KGB on 
Khrushchev’s policy during the crisis also reflected the 
limitations of its chairman. In December 1961 the 
influential Aleksandr Shelepin had been succeeded as 
chairman by his less able protege, Vladimir Semichastny, 
who knew so little about intelligence and was so 
unattracted by the post offered to him that he accepted it 
only under pressure from Khrushchev. Khrushchev made 
clear that his main reason for appointing Semichastny was 
to ensure the political loyalty of the KGB rather than to 
benefit from his advice on foreign policy. There is no sign 
in any of the files noted by Mitrokhin that Semichastny 
ever followed Shelepin ’s example of submitting to 
Khrushchev ambitious grand strategies for combating the 
Main Adversary. During the missile crisis Semichastny 
had not a single meeting with Khrushchev and was never 
invited to attend meetings of the Presidium (an enlarged 
Politburo which for the previous decade had been the 
main policy-making body). 

Nor did Khrushchev ever ask for, or receive from, the 
KGB any assessment of the likely American response to 
the placing of nuclear missile bases in Cuba.^^ As foreign 
intelligence chief, Sakharovsky seems to have had little 
insight into American policy-making. Though apparently 
a competent bureaucrat in the Soviet mold, his first-hand 
experience of the outside world was limited to Romania 
and other parts of eastern Europe. His melancholy 
expression was probably, as one of his subordinates has 



written, “due to the enormous pressures of the job.”^^ 
Among the pressures was the need to conform to the 
highest standards of political correctness. The FCD rarely 
submitted assessments save at the specific request of the 
Foreign Ministry, the International Department of the 
Central Committee or the Presidium. Most of what it 
termed its “analyses” were, in reality, little more than 
digests of information on particular topics which 
generally avoided arriving at conclusions for fear that 
these might conflict with the opinions of higher authority. 
The supreme authority during the missile crisis was 
Khrushchev himself rather than the Presidium. To a 
remarkable degree he both determined Soviet policy and, 
like Stalin before him, acted as his own chief intelligence 
analyst.^^ 

Intelligence did, however, have some influence on 
Khrushchev’s policy during the final stages of the crisis. 
On October 25 he indicated to the Presidium that, in order 
to resolve the crisis, it might ultimately be necessary to 
dismantle the missile bases in return for a US guarantee 
not to invade Cuba. Khrushchev, however, was not yet 
ready to make such a proposal. He changed his mind 
during the night of October 25-6 after a GRU report that 
US Strategic Air Command had been placed on nuclear 
alert. Hitherto he had hoped to save face by obtaining the 
removal of US missile bases in Turkey in return for 
stopping the construction of Soviet missile sites in Cuba. 
On the morning of October 26, however, wrongly fearing 



that an American invasion of Cuba might be imminent, he 
dictated a rambling and emotional plea for peace to 
Kennedy which asked for a US guarantee of Cuban 
territorial integrity but made no mention of the Turkish 
missile bases. Within twenty-four hours, Khrushchev had 
changed his mind. On October 27, having concluded that 
an American invasion was not imminent after all, he sent 
another letter insisting that the Turkish bases must be part 
of the deal.^^ 

Shortly after Khrushchev had sent his second letter, 
Soviet air defense in Cuba, apparently as a result of a 
failure in the chain of command, shot down an American 
U-2 spy plane over Cuba, killing the pilot. Khrushchev 
panicked. Reports that Kennedy was to make a speech on 
national television at noon on October 28 wrongly 
persuaded him that the President might be about to 
announce an invasion of Cuba. Khrushchev gave in and 
accepted Kennedy’s terms: a unilateral withdrawal of “all 
Soviet offensive arms” from Cuba. To make sure his 
message reached Kennedy in time, he ordered it to be 
broadcast over Radio Moscow.^^ 

THE HUMILIATION OF the Soviet climbdown at the 
end of the missile crisis, which led two years later to 
Khrushchev’s overthrow in a Kremlin palace coup, was 
strengthened in the Centre by the discovery of a series of 
penetrations by, and defections to, the CIA. In December 
1961 a KGB officer. Major Anatoli Mikhailovich 



Golitsyn, walked into the American embassy in Helsinki 
and was exfiltrated to the United States. In September 
1962 the KGB arrested GRU Colonel Oleg Penkovsky, 
who for the past eighteen months had been providing 
high-grade intelligence to the British and Americans. 

The damage report on Golitsyn produced the usual 
stereotyped denunciation of his motives. Since it was 
impossible to criticize either the KGB or the Soviet 
system, it followed that the basic cause of all defections 
was the moral failings of the defectors themselves — in 
particular, “the virus of careerism” unscrupulously 
exploited by Western intelligence services: 

The treason of Golitsyn, an ambitious and vain man, 
provides a typical example of a person representing 
the tribe of careerists. In the mid-1950s he reacted 
painfully to a demotion in his position: he could not 
tolerate having his mistakes and blunders pointed out 
and commented on. Emphasizing his exceptional 
qualities, he said that only bad luck had prevented 
him from becoming a highly successful senior 
officer during the Stalin period. [Late in 1961] 
Golitsyn made persistent attempts to learn the 
contents of the evaluation written on him for 
Moscow, which was negative. The [Helsinki] 
Residency believes that he succeeded in learning its 
essence and, knowing from the experience of others 
that he could expect a serious talk in the personnel 



department and a demotion in rank, he defected to 
the United States. 

Like all defectors, Golitsyn was given an insulting 
codename — in his case, GOR-BATY (“Hunchback”).^ ^ 
Measures taken to discredit him included the arrest of a 
Soviet smuggler (codenamed MUSTAFA), who was 
persuaded to implicate Golitsyn in contraband operations 
across the Finnish border. An article in the newspaper 
Sovetskaya Rossiya on September 27, 1962 condemned 
Golitsyn’s (fictitious) involvement with smugglers. 

Despite the Centre’s attempt to belittle Golitsyn, the 
damage assessment after his defection concluded that he 
had been able to betray a wide range of intelligence to the 
CIA on the operations of most of the “Lines” 
(departments) at the Helsinki and other residencies, as 
well as KGB methods of recruiting and running agents. 
Between January 4 and February 16, 1962 the Centre sent 
instructions to fifty-four residents on the action required 
to limit the damage to current operations. For the time 
being, all meetings with important agents were to be 
suspended and contact limited to “impersonal means” 
such as dead letter-boxes.^^ 

As well as providing important intelligence on KGB 
methods and leads to a number of Soviet agents, however, 
Golitsyn also confused the CIA with a series of 
increasingly extravagant conspiracy theories. He 



persuaded the head of the CIA counter-intelligence staff, 
James Angleton, that the KGB was engaged in a gigantic 
global deception, and that even the Sino- Soviet split was a 
charade to deceive the West. Golitsyn was later to 
maintain that the Prague Spring in Czechoslovakia was 
also a KGB description.^^ It did not occur to the Centre 
that Golitsyn’s defection, by infecting a small but 
troublesome minority of CIA officers with his own 
paranoid tendencies, would ultimately do the Agency 
more harm than good. 

In November 1963 Aleksandr Nikolayevich 
Cherepanov of the KGB Second Chief Directorate 
(internal security and counter-intelligence), sent the 
American embassy in Moscow a packet of highly 
classified papers dealing with the surveillance and 
entrapment of diplomats and other foreigners in Russia, 
together with a note offering his services to the CIA. In 
the ambassador’s absence, the deputy head of mission 
feared that the documents were part of a KGB 
provocation. Though the head of the CIA station was 
allowed to photograph the documents, the originals, 
despite his protests, were returned to the Russians. 
Cherepanov fled from Moscow but was arrested by KGB 
border guards on the frontier with Turkestan on December 
17, 1963. He admitted during interrogation that the 
operational secrets he had revealed to the Americans 
included the use of “spy dust” (metka), special chemicals 
applied to suspects’ shoes to facilitate tracking. 



Cherepanov was sentenced to death at a secret trial in 
April 1964. The Centre’s damage assessment of the case 
concluded: 

It is not possible to determine why the Americans 
betrayed Cherepanov. Either they suspected that his 
action was a KGB provocation or they wanted to 
burden the KGB with a lengthy search for the person 
who had sent the package to the embassy. 

Though the CIA was not responsible for Cherepanov’s 
betrayal, it was shortly to make another, even more 
serious error. In February 1964 Yuri Ivanovich Nosenko, 
a KGB officer serving on the Soviet disarmament 
delegation in Geneva, who had begun working for the 
Agency in June 1962, defected to the United States. 
Nosenko ’s CIA debriefers, however, wrongly concluded 
that he was a KGB plant. 

Unaware of the CIA’s horrendous misjudgement, the 
Centre regarded Nosenko ’s defection as a serious setback. 
Its damage assessment began with the usual character 
assassination, claiming that Nosenko (henceforth 
codenamed IDOL), had been infected — like Golitsyn — 
with the “virus of careerism:” 

Nosenko, who lusted for power, did not hide his 
ambitions and obtained a high position. The 
leadership of Department 1 at Headquarters will not 



forget Nosenko’s hysterical reaction when he was 
informed of their plans to promote him from deputy 
chief to chief of section [otdeleniye]. “The chief of 
the directorate has promised that I will replace the 
head of the department [otdeiy he shouted 
shamelessly. The characteristics of careerism were 
evident in many curious facets of his life. When he 
became the deputy chief of another department, 
Nosenko was ashamed of his rank [KGB captain], 
which was below that normally associated with his 
position. He would return unsigned any documents 
with “Captain” on them, and would only sign 
documents on which his perceptive subordinates had 
not indicated his rank.^^ 

Throughout the Cold War, the KGB had much greater 
success in collecting scientific and technological 
intelligence (S&T) on the Main Adversary than 
penetrating the federal government. In 1963 the S&T 
department of the FCD was given enhanced status as 
Directorate T.^^ Most of its tasking came from the 
Military — Industrial Commission (VPK), which was 
responsible for overseeing weapons production, and 
was obsessed with American armaments and advanced 
technology — almost to the exclusion of the rest of the 
world. In the early 1960s over 90 percent of 
VPK requirements concerned the Main Adversary. 



Among the American S&T obtained by the KGB during 
these years was intelligence on aircraft and rocket 
technology, turbojet engines (from a source in General 
Electric), the Phantom jet fighter, nuclear research, 
computers, transistors, radio electronics, chemical 
engineering and metallurgy. S&T agents in the United 
States identified in Mitrokin’s notes (though with few 
details of their accomplishments) include: STARIK and 
BOR (or BORG), who worked as research scientists for 
the US air force; URBAN, identified by Mitrokhin as a 
department head at Kellogg (probably the M. W. Kellogg 
Technology Company in Houston), who had served as an 
agent since 1940;^^ BERG, a senior engineer probably 
employed by Sperry-Rand (UNIVAC);^^ VIE, who 
worked for the chemical manufacturers Union Carbide; 
FELKE, an agent in Du Pont de Nemours, the chemical, 
biomedical and petroleum conglomerate; USACH, of the 
Brookhaven National Laboratory at Upton, New York, 
which carried out government research on nuclear energy, 
high-energy physics and electronics; and NORTON of 
RCA, which manufactured electronic, 

telecommunications and defense equipment. 

During the Cold War, unlike the Second World War, 
the dwindling band of American Communists and fellow 
travelers rarely had access to the S&T sought by the 
KGB. Most S&T agents recruited in the United States 
seem to have spied for money. Two such mercenary spies 



were caught by the FBI during the mid-1960s: John 
Butenko, who worked for an ITT subsidiary which did 
classified work for Strategic Air Command, and Colonel 
William Whalen, who provided intelligence on missiles 
and atomic weapons. In 1963 the New York residency 
supplied 114 classified S&T documents, totaling 7,967 
pages, and 30,131 unclassified documents, totaling 
181,454 pages, as well as 71 “samples” of state-of-the-art 
technology and other items. Washington sent the Centre 
37 classified documents (3,944 pages) and 1,408 
unclassified documents (34,506 pages). 

Some of the best American S&T, however, came from 
residencies outside the United States. Possibly the most 
important was in the field of computer technology, where 
the Soviet Union had fallen far behind the West. The 
experimental Soviet BESM-1, produced in 1953, was 
judged by a Western expert to be “a respectable 
computer” for its time, with a capability superior to that of 
the UNIVAC-1 introduced in 1951. The BESM-2, 
however, which went into production in 1959, was only a 
third as fast as the IBM-7094, introduced in 1955, and 
one-sixteenth as fast as the IBM-7090 of 1959. Because 
of the embargo on the export of advanced technology to 
the Soviet Union maintained by COCOM (the embargo 
coordinating committee of NATO members and Japan), 
the computers legally imported from the West were barely 
more powerful than their Soviet counterparts.^^ During 



the 1960s the attempt to catch up with Western computer 
technology was based largely on espionage. 

The KGB’s main source of computer S&T was, almost 
certainly, IBM, which manufactured over half the 
computers in use around the world in the mid-1960s. 
Within IBM, the most important KGB agent identified in 
Mitrokhin’s notes was ALVAR, a naturalized French 
citizen bom in Tsarist Russia, whose motives — ^unlike 
most Americans in the S&T network — may well have 
been ideological. Probably the KGB’s longest-serving 
Line X agent, ALVAR had been recmited by the NKVD 
in 1935. By the 1950s he held a senior post at IBM’s 
European headquarters in Paris, and in 1958 was awarded 
the Order of the Red Banner for his work as a Soviet 
agent. ALVAR carried on working for the KGB until his 
retirement in the late 1970s, when he was awarded a 
Soviet pension of 300 dollars a month in addition to his 
company pension — a certain sign of the Centre’s 
appreciation of him. 

In the early 1960s the Paris residency supplied 
intelligence on American transistor manufacture which, 
according to KGB files, both improved the quality of 
Soviet transistors and brought forward the start of mass 
production by one and a half years. It also provided S&T 
on computer networking systems which were later 
imitated by the Soviet defense ministry. The most likely 
source of the intelligence on both transistor production 
and computer networks was ALVAR. From 1964, 



however, the Paris residency also had an agent, 
codenamed KLOD, in Texas Instruments.^^ 

Among other agents who provided technology and 
S&T from IBM was a Nordic national, codenamed 
KHONG. From 1960 to 1966 KHONG worked for a 
European affiliate of IBM, and purchased embargoed 
materials and samples worth 124,000 dollars, which he 
passed on to the KGB. In both 1961 and 1962 he was 
questioned by the local US embassy on the reasons for his 
purchases, but appears to have satisfied the embassy on 
both occasions. KHONG’ s motives, unlike ALVAR’ s, 
seem to have been mainly financial. He was initially paid 
10 percent commission, subsequently raised to 15 percent, 
on his purchases from IBM. KHONG later worked for the 
United Nations in a number of countries. The fact that he 
had a total of twelve controllers during his career as a 
Soviet agent is evidence that the Centre considered him an 
important source. By the time contact with him ceased in 
1982, a year after his retirement, the KGB had held about 
150 meetings with him.^^ 

The Soviet Union often found it more difficult to use 
than to collect the remarkable S&T which it collected 
from American businesses, most of them defense 
contractors. In 1965 the Politburo criticized the fact that 
there was a time lag of two to three years before Soviet 
industry began exploiting S&T.^^ Even the computer 
technology stolen by the KGB did no more than, at best. 



stabilize the striking gap between East and West The 
gap was not to be explained by any lack of expertise 
among Soviet scientists and mathematicians. As one 
Canadian expert wrote in 1968, “Westerners who know 
Soviet computer scientists can testify to their competence 
and their thorough knowledge of the field. The 
continued backwardness of the Soviet computer industry, 
despite the expertise of Soviet scientists and the 
remarkable S&T obtained by the KGB, reflected the 
cumbersome inefficiency of the Soviet command 
economy, in which technological innovation had to run 
the gauntlet of a complex and unresponsive state 
bureaucracy. 

Rather than accept any share of responsibility for the 
failure to make efficient use of much of the S&T acquired 
from the West, the VPK chairman, L. V. Smirnov, blamed 
the KGB for not obtaining enough of it. In a letter to the 
KGB chairman, Semichastny, in April 1965, Smirnov 
complained that over 50 percent of the top priority S&T 
tasks assigned to the KGB between two and four years 
earlier had still not been fulfilled. Semichastny replied 
that steps had been taken to improve the KGB’s ability to 
meet its assignments, but criticized the VPK for 
underestimating the current difficulty of collecting S&T 
from American targets. Since some of the same scientific 
and technological developments were taking place in 
Britain, France, Japan and West Germany, the VPK 
should pay greater attention to targets in these countries. 



76 


In the following year groups of Line X officers 
operating against American targets were stationed in 
residencies in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Denmark, 
Finland, India, Israel, Lebanon, Mexico, Morocco, 
Norway, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Arab Republic 
and a number of other Third World countries 

Despite Smirnov’s criticisms, the KGB’s performance 
in S&T collection was, on balance, a success story. As 
Smirnov himself acknowledged, the FCD fulfilled almost 
half of the VPK’s demanding tasks against the Main 
Adversary with a few years at most. Measured against the 
spectacular successes of twenty years earlier, however, 
when the Centre had received the plans of the atomic 
bomb — the world’s greatest scientific secret — from two 
different agents and important nuclear intelligence from 
several more, even the successes of the early 1960s were 
bound to seem somewhat disappointing. The decline was 
irreversible. Most of the Soviet spies who penetrated 
every major branch of the Roosevelt administration had 
been ideological agents, seduced by the myth-image of 
Stalin’s Russia as the world’s first worker-peasant state, 
pointing the way to a new Socialist society. During the 
early Cold War, even among American radicals, the 
vision faded. Most of the successors to the wartime 
ideological moles were mercenary walk-ins and corrupt 
employees of defense contractors willing to sell their 
companies’ secrets. 

Though the KGB could not bring itself to accept it, the 



golden age of the high-flying American ideological agent 
had gone, never to return.

TWELVE 


THE MAIN ADVERSARY 


Part 3: Illegals after ‘‘Abel” 


In 1966 the lack of high-grade political intelligence from 
the United States led the KGB Collegium, a senior 
advisory body headed by the Chairman, to call for a major 
improvement in intelligence operations against the Main 
Adversary. The chief method by which it proposed to 
achieve this improvement, however, was one which had 
already been attempted unsuccessfully during the 1950s: 
the creation over the next few years of a network of illegal 
residencies which would take over the main burden of 
intelligence operations from the legal residencies in New 
York, Washington and San Francisco.^ 

Not until six years after the arrest of “Rudolf Abel” in 
1957 did the KGB succeed in establishing another illegal 
residency on the territory of the Main Adversary. Though 



there were brief missions to or through the United States 
by a number of illegals, the first to have taken up 
residence who is recorded in the files noted by Mitrokhin 
was KONOV, a Muscovite of Greek origin bom in 1912, 
who took the identity of Gerhard Max Kohler, a Sudeten 
German bom in Reichenberg (now part of the Czech 
Republic) in 1917. KONOV was a war veteran and radio 
specialist who worked as head of a laboratory in 
Leningrad until his recmitment by the KGB in April 
1955. He spent the next four years in East Germany, 
working as an engineer, establishing his German cover 
identity and studying both his next destination. West 
Germany, and his ultimate target, the United States. The 
KGB, which specialized in arranged marriages for its 
illegals, found him a German wife and assistant 
previously employed by the Stasi, codenamed EMMA, 
who took the identity of Ema Helga Maria Decker, bom 
on September 2, 1928 near Breslau (now in Poland).^ 

In October 1959, posing as East German refugees, 
KONOV and EMMA crossed to the ERG, where 
KONOV found work as a radio engineer. In 1962 he 
began corresponding with American radio and electronics 
companies and obtained several job offers. After visiting 
the United States as a tourist, he accepted employment in 
a company which in 1963 enabled EMMA and himself to 
obtain immigrant visas. KONOV seems to have been the 
first post-war illegal sent to the United States to 
concentrate on scientific and technological intelligence 



(S&T). Specializing in electronic measuring devices, he 

took part in a number of international exhibitions and — 

according to his file — made several inventions. 

KONOV’s S&T was so highly rated by the Centre that it 

won him two KGB awards. On June 20, 1970, after living 

for seven years in the United States as Gerhard and Ema 

Kohler, KONOV and EMMA became American citizens, 

swearing their oaths of allegiance in Newark Courthouse. 
3 

By the time KONOV entered the United States in 1963, 
two other KGB illegals were already established in 
Canada, both intended by the Centre for subsequent 
transfer to the Main Adversary. Nikolai Nikolayevich 
Bitnov (codenamed ALBERT) had arrived in Canada in 
1961. The basis of the legend painstakingly constructed 
for Bitnov was a fabricated version of the life history of 
Leopold Lambert Delbrouck, who had been bom in 
Belgium in 1899, emigrated to Russia with his family at 
the age of eight and died there in 1946. In the fictitious 
version of Delbrouck’ s career constmcted by the Centre, 
however, Delbrouck had married a Romanian woman, set 
up home in Gleiwitz in Germany (now Gliwice in Poland) 
and then moved to Romania, where he died in 1931. 
While in Gleiwitz, the couple had supposedly had a son, 
Jean Leopold Delbrouck, whose identity Bitnov assumed. 
Bitnov’ s wife, Nina (codenamed GERA), took over the 
identity of a “dead double,” Yanina Batarovskaya, who 
had been bom in France in 1928 and died in Lithuania in 



1956.4 

Early in 1956, now age thirty, Bitnov moved with his 
wife to Romania to establish his legend with the help of 
the Romanian intelligence service, the DGSP. In April 
1957, using identity documents forged by the Centre, they 
succeeded in obtaining passports from the Belgian 
diplomatic mission in Bucharest.^ Six months later, they 
moved to Geneva so that Bitnov could enroll in a business 
school and learn how to operate as a businessman in the 
West. From late 1958 to the summer of 1961 the couple 
lived in Liege, establishing Belgian identities and 
obtaining new passports which, unlike those issued in 
Bucharest, made no reference to their residence in 
Romania and were thus less likely to arouse suspicion in 
North America. In July 1960, the Bitnovs emigrated to 
Canada.^ 

The Centre probably intended that Bitnov should move 
on after a few years to the territory of the Main 
Adversary. Initially, however, he was ordered, like Brik 
(HART) a decade earlier, to establish himself under 
business cover in Canada. Despite his course in Geneva, 
however, Bitnov proved a hopeless businessman. First, he 
invested 2,000 dollars of KGB funds in a business which 
bought up land with mineral rights and sold them to 
mining companies. After two years the company went 
bankrupt. Then Bitnov spent 2,000 dollars purchasing a 
directorship in a car dealership which went into 



liquidation only two months later. Unwilling to pour good 
money after bad into any more of his investment schemes, 
the Centre ordered him to look for paid employment. 
After a period on unemployment benefits, Bitnov found a 
poorly paid job as a bookkeeper which, he complained, 
left him little or no time for intelligence work. Having 
achieved nothing of any significance as an illegal, he was 
recalled to Moscow in 1969.^ The following year, he was 
given a pension and sent into early retirement at the age of 
only forty-five.^ The fact that the Centre persevered with 
Bitnov for so long was further evidence of the strength of 
its determination to establish a network of illegal 
residencies in North America. 

Bitnov was unaware that in February 1962, only seven 
months after his own arrival in Canada, another illegal, 
codenamed DOUGLAS, had landed with his wife and 
four-year-old son at Montreal airport. DOUGLAS was 
Dalibar Valoushek, a 3 3 -year-old Czech border guard 
recruited by the KGB with the assistance of its 
Czechoslovak counterpart, the StB.^ He took the identity 
of a Sudeten German, Rudolf Albert Herrmann, who had 
died in the Soviet Union during the Second World War. 
According to Valoushek’ s legend, Herrmann had survived 
the war and made his home in East Germany, then taken 
refuge in the West to escape the Communist regime. His 
wife, Inga (codenamed GERDA), a Sudeten German 
whose family had moved to the GDR, took the identity of 



Ingalore Noerke, a “dead double” who had been killed 
during the wartime bombing of Stettin. At the end of 1957 
the Valousheks fled to the West, loudly proclaiming their 
hatred of the East German regime. They spent the next 
four years strengthening their legends as anti-Communist 
refugees while Valoushek learned how to run a small 
business. 

Once in Canada, Valoushek proved a much better 
businessman than Bitnov — though not quite as successful 
as published accounts of his career (which do not give his 
real identity) have suggested. Soon after his arrival in 
Canada he bought Harold’s Famous Delicatessen in 
downtown Toronto, which he and Inga, as “Rudi” and 
“Inga Herrmann” made a popular rendezvous for staff 
from the nearby studios of the Canadian Broadcasting 
Company. After two years Valoushek sold the 
delicatessen, got a job as a CBC sound engineer and took 
courses in film-making. His first major assignment was 
on a film advertising campaign for the Liberal Party. By 
the mid-1960s he had a reputation as a popular and 
successful film-maker. At the 1967 Liberal convention, 
which elected Pierre Trudeau as party leader, Trudeau 
leaned off the stage and playfully popped grapes into 
“Rudi Herrmann’s” mouth. Though Valoushek’s 
business appeared prosperous, however, his KGB file 
reveals that the Centre had to provide 10,000 dollars to 
cover trading losses. 



In 1967 Valoushek became the controller of the KGB’s 
most important Canadian agent, Hugh Hambleton 
(RADOV).^^ After losing his job at NATO on security 
grounds in 1961 (though without any charges being 
brought against him), Hambleton had spent the next three 
years taking a PhD at the London School of Economics, 
returning to Canada in 1967 to become a professor in the 
economics department at Laval University in Quebec. 
Once back in Quebec, Hambleton’ s contact with the KGB 
dwindled. He met an officer from the legal residency 
three times in Ottawa, on each occasion talking to him in 
a car parked near the main post office. Hambleton, 
however, disliked his new controller, who tried 
unsuccessfully to persuade him to apply for a job in 
External Affairs. After an interval during which 
Hambleton failed to turn up for meetings in Ottawa, 
Valoushek was sent to Quebec to renew contact with him. 
During a congenial dinner at the Chateau Frontenac 
overlooking the Saint Lawrence river, the two men 
established a mutual rapport and Hambleton agreed to 
resume his career as a Soviet agent. Over the next few 
years, he traveled to a great variety of destinations, 
combining research on academic projects with work for 
the KGB. He remained in touch with Valoushek until 
1975, meeting him in Trinidad and Haiti, as well as 
Canada and the United States. But Hambleton ’s travels 
were so far flung that it required a considerable number of 



KGB officers to maintain contact with him.^^ 

In 1968, a year after becoming Canadian citizens, 
Valoushek and his family were transferred to the United 
States to found a new illegal residency in the New York 
area. His first KGB contact was IVANOVA, a young 
Russian woman who, having formerly worked as an agent 
of the KGB Second Chief Directorate inside the Soviet 
Union, had been allowed (perhaps even encouraged) to 
marry an American visitor and had moved to the United 
States. IVANOVA gave Valoushek 15,000 dollars to 
establish himself and had several further secret meetings 
with him to pass on instructions from the Centre and 
letters from his Czech relatives. With the funds 
provided by IVANOVA, Valoushek made a 12,000 dollar 
downpayment on a secluded house fifteen miles north of 
New York, in Hartsdale,^^ joined the New York Press 
Club and began work as a freelance cameraman and 
commercial photographer. His first major assignment 
from the KGB was to penetrate the Hudson Institute, a 
leading New York think tank. The Centre had been 
excited by a report from Hambleton giving information on 
the Institute’s members and believed it to be a major 
potential source of intelligence on American global 
strategy and defense policy. 

IN MAY 1962, three months after Valoushek’ s arrival, 
BOGUN, another Soviet illegal, had landed in Canada. 



The Centre intended that, after establishing himself in 
Canada, BOGUN, like DOUGLAS, should transfer to the 
territory of the Main Adversary. BOGUN was Gennadi 
Petrovich Blyablin, a 38-year-old Muscovite who had 
taken the identity of Peter Carl Fisher, bom in Sofia in 
1929 of a German father and Bulgarian mother. Like 
Valoushek, he perfected his German legend by living in 
East Germany, then moved to the West in 1959, posing as 
a refugee. The Centre allowed him three years to settle, 
legalize his status and find work in West Germany before 
sending him to Canada. On March 9, 1961 Blyablin 
married his KGBAPPROVED partner, LENA, in 
Hanover. In December they obtained their West German 
passports before setting off for Canada five months 
later. 

While Valoushek found cover as a film-maker, 
Blyablin established himself as a freelance press 
photographer — a profession which provided numerous 
opportunities and pretexts for traveling around Canada 
and further afield. In Febmary 1965, following the 
Centre’s instmctions, Blyablin and his wife moved to the 
United States on immigrant visas. His main task over the 
next three years was photographing and providing 
intelligence on major military, scientific and industrial 
targets around the United States. 

In 1968, however, Blyablin attracted the attention of 
the FBI during his investigation of major targets in the 
United States and had to be hurriedly recalled, together 



with his wife, to Moscow.^ ^ It was later discovered that 
some of his correspondence with the Centre, routed via 
agent SKIP, had been intercepted. SKIP was Karo 
Huseinjyan, an ethnic Armenian bom in Cypms in 1919 
was Karo Huseinjyan, an ethnic Armenian bom in Cypms 
in 1919 who owned a jewelry shop in Beimt and provided 
a forwarding service for a number of illegals. A Centre 
investigation disclosed that letters from Blyablin, dated 
April 7 and July 27, 1968, sent via Huseinjyan, had been 
steamed open.^^ 

A year before Blyablin’ s sudden recall, RYBAKOV, 
another Soviet illegal, had arrived in the United States. 
RYBAKOV was Anatoli Ivanovich Rudenko, whose 
early career was strikingly similar to Blyablin’ s. Like 
Blyablin, Rudenko was a Muscovite bom in 1924 who 
had assumed a bogus German identity, spent several years 
in East Germany working on his legend and then moved 
to the West. Rudenko was given the identity documents of 
Heinz Walter August Peder, bom in Kalisch on 
November 6, 1927.^^ While in East Germany he had 
trained as a piano tuner and repairer. After crossing to 
West Germany in April 1961, posing as a refugee from 
Communism, he found a job with the world-famous piano 
manufacturers Steinway in Hamburg. Though Rudenko 
was told that his ultimate destination was the United 
States, in 1964 he was sent to work with a musical 
instmment company in London, probably in order to 



accustom him to an English-speaking environment.^^ 

Rudenko’s period in London almost ended in disaster. 
Once, while returning from Brussels, where he had 
received his maintenance allowance from a KGB 
operations officer, he was stopped at Heathrow and 500 
pounds were found on him which he had failed to declare. 
Rudenko was fortunate to find a sympathetic customs 
officer. The money, he pleaded, was his life savings, the 
product of many sacrifices over the years. He was allowed 
to keep the 500 pounds and no action was taken against 
him. 

In 1966 he went to New York on a tourist visa and 
visited the Manhattan showrooms of Steinway & Sons on 
West 57th Street, who offered Rudenko a job with a 
salary of 80 dollars a week. With Steinway ’s assistance, 
he gained a work permit and traveled to the United States 
on his German passport in July 1967. In New York 
Rudenko became piano tuner to a series of celebrities — 
among them Nelson Rockefeller, Governor of New York, 
unsuccessful candidate for the Republican nomination in 
1964 and future vice-president of the United States.^^ 
Rockefeller was regarded in Moscow as the “patron” of 
Henry Kissinger, who in January 1969 became President 
Nixon’s National Security Adviser (and later Secretary of 
State).^^ While professor at Harvard during the 1960s, 
Kissinger had served as Nelson’s paid part-time adviser 
and speechwriter, receiving a severance pay gift of 50,000 



dollars when he joined the Nixon administration. “He has 
a second-rate mind but a first-rate intuition about people,” 
Kissinger once said of Rockefeller. “I have a first-rate 
mind but a third-rate intuition about people. 

To the Centre it must have seemed that Rudenko had 
penetrated one of the innermost sanctums of the capitalist 
system, which the Rockefeller family had seemed to 
epitomize for three generations. Nelson’s second wife, 
“Happy,” said of him in the mid-1960s, “He believed he 
could have it all. He always had.” The six square miles of 
Nelson’s Westchester estate were one of the world’s most 
valuable properties and contained some of the most 
spectacular art treasures in any private collection. 
Theodore White once offered to exchange his Manhattan 
townhouse on East 64th Street for a single Tong Dynasty 
horse from the Westchester collection.^^ Though 
Rudenko’s occasional visits to Westchester impressed the 
Centre, however, they achieved nothing of significance. 

Penetrating the houses of the great and good appears to 
have become almost an end in itself for Rudenko, even 
though his access to some of new York’s most 
distinguished pianos failed to give him any intelligence 
access. Among the well-known musicians whose pianos 
he tuned was the world’s most famous pianist, the 
Russian-bom Vladimir Horowitz, who for the past twenty 
years had lived on East 94th Street near Central Park. In 
1965, after a twelve-year hiatus caused by a mixture of 
psychiatric problems and colitis attacks, Horowitz had 



returned to the concert platform at the age of sixty-two, 
becoming, with Luciano Pavarotti, one of the two most 
highly paid classical musicians in the world. The recital 
instrument which he chose for his comeback was the 
Steinway concert grand numbered CD 186, which had to 
be tuned to an exact 440-A with a key pressure of 45 
grams instead of the usual 48 to 

Overimpressed by Rudenko’s access to the pianos of 
new York’s celebrities, the Centre made detailed plans for 
him to become head of a new illegal residency whose 
chief targets would be the US mission to the United 
Nations and a New York think tank, concentrating on 
relatively junior employees with access to classified 
information — in particular, single women whose 
loneliness made them sexually vulnerable and poorly paid 
employees with large families who were open to financial 
inducements.^^ 

Just as the new residency was about to be established in 
New York, however, the Centre noticed what Rudenko’s 
file refers to as “irregularities” and “suspicious behavior” 
and lured him back to Moscow in April 1970 for what he 
was probably told were final instructions before 
beginning work. Exactly what the Centre suspected is not 
known, but, since Rudenko was interrogated under 
torture, it may well have feared he was working as a 
double agent for the FBI. What he revealed was much less 
serious, but bad enough to end his career as an illegal. 
Soon after arriving in Hamburg in 1961, Rudenko had 



met BERTA, a 32-year-old ladies’ hairdresser, whom he 
had suggested recruiting as a Soviet agent. The Centre 
refused and ordered him to break off all relations with her. 
During his interrogation in 1970, Rudenko admitted that 
he had secretly defied his instructions, married BERTA 
and taken her with him to New York. Worse still, he had 
taken down radio messages from the Centre and decoded 
them in her presence. Her parents had discovered that he 
was a spy, but believed he was working for East 
Germany. Rudenko also admitted that he was having an 
affair with a female accountant (codenamed MIRA) in 
Pennsylvania.^^ 

As part of the Centre’s damage limitation exercise it 
instructed Rudenko to write to both BERTA and MIRA 
letters designed to convince both of them and, if 
necessary, the FBI that he had left the United States 
because of the breakdown of his marriage. He told 
BERTA that he had found it impossible to live with her 
any longer and urged her not to waste time trying to track 
him down since she would never find him. In the letter to 
MIRA, Rudenko was allowed to express his love for her 
and pain at their separation within what his file quaintly 
describes as “permissible bounds” and his pain at the 
separation from her. But, he explained somewhat 
unconvincingly, his sudden departure from the United 
States had been the only way to escape from his wife. 
Both letters were posted by the KGB in Austria, giving no 
other indication of where Rudenko was living. 



THE SUCCESSIVE FAILURES of Makayev (HARRY), 
Brik (HART), Hayhanen (VIK), Grinchenko (KLOD), 
Bitnov (ALBERT), Blyablin (BOGUN) and Rudenko 
(RYBAKOV) underscored the Centre’s difficulty in 
finding illegals capable of fulfilling its expectations in 
North America. Fisher/“Abel” (MARK) was, in many 
ways, the exception who proved the rule. He was able to 
survive, if not actually succeed, as an illegal resident in 
the United States because of a long experience of the 
West which went back to his Tyneside childhood, an 
ideological commitment which probably predated even 
the Bolshevik Revolution and a thirty-year career as a 
foreign intelligence officer, most of it under Stalin, from 
which he had emerged scarred but battle-hardened. Other 
Cold War illegals in the United States were 
psychologically less well prepared for the stress of their 
double lives. All had to come to terms with a society 
which was strikingly different from the propaganda image 
of the Main Adversary with which they had been 
indoctrinated in Moscow. Unlike KGB officers stationed 
in legal residencies, illegals did not work in a Soviet 
embassy, where they were constantly subject to the 
ideological discipline imposed by the official hierarchy. 
They also had to cope with a much greater degree of 
personal isolation, which they could diminish only by 
friendships and sexual liaisons which were liable to 
undermine their professional discipline. No wonder that 



some illegals, like Rudenko, had affairs which they tried 
to conceal from the Centre; that others, like Hayhanen, 
took to drink and embezzlement; and that others, like 
Bitnov, found it difficult to survive in an alien market 
economy. 

Illegals had also to face unreasonable, and ultimately 
impossible, expectations from the Centre. Until almost the 
end of the Cold War, no post-war Soviet leader, KGB 
chairman or foreign intelligence chief had either any 
personal experience of living in the West or any realistic 
understanding of it. Accustomed to strong central 
direction and a command economy, the Centre found it 
difficult to fathom how the United States could achieve 
such high levels of economic production and 
technological innovation with so little apparent regulation. 
The gap in its understanding of what made the United 
States tick tended to be filled by conspiracy theory. The 
diplomat, and later defector, Arkadi Shevchenko noted of 
his Soviet colleague: 

Many are inclined to the fantastic notion that there 
must be a secret control center somewhere in the 
United States. They themselves, after all, are used to 
a system ruled by a small group working in secrecy 
in one place. Moreover, the Soviets continue to chew 
on Lenin’s dogma that bourgeois governments are 
just the “servants” of monopoly capital. “Is not that 
the secret command center?” they reason.^^ 



However much the Centre learned about the West, it 
never truly understood it. Worse still, it thought it did. 

THE CENTRE’S FAITH in the future of illegal 
operations in the United States was remarkably unaffected 
by the many failures and disappointments of the 1950s 
and 1960s. At the beginning of the 1970s the Centre still 
had high hopes of KONOV and DOUGLAS. It also had 
remarkably ambitious projects for the next decade. A plan 
drawn up in the late 1960s envisaged establishing and 
putting into operation between 1969 and 1975 ten illegal 
residencies in the United States, two in Canada, two in 
Mexico, and one each in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, 
Uruguay and Venezuela. For use in wartime and other 
major crises it was also planned to create five “strategic 
communications residencies” to maintain contact with the 
Centre if legal residencies were unable to operate: two in 
the United States, one in Canada and two in Latin 
America. 

This visionary program was to prove hopelessly 
optimistic. The 1970s produced another crop of serious 
setbacks in illegal operations in the United States — 
among them the collapse of the illegal residencies of 
KONOV and DOUGLAS. When KONOV and EMMA 
swore their oaths of allegiance as American citizens in 
1970, their neighbors apparently regarded them as a 
model married couple. In reality, the increasing friction 



between them had begun to affect their operational 
effectiveness. In 1971 they flew to Haiti to be divorced, 
but informed only the Centre and their New York lawyer. 
On their return they still contrived to keep up appearances 
as a married couple by living together in their New Jersey 
apartment. EMMA, however, asked the Centre to find her 
a new partner. In October 1972 KONOV was recalled to 
Moscow, where he died three years later. EMMA was 
dismissed from the KGB.^^ 

Valoushek’s career as the illegal DOUGLAS was to 
end a few years later in even greater ignominy. His first 
assignment in the United States, to penetrate the Hudson 
Institute, was wholly unrealistic. As Valoushek later 
complained, had he been able to use his real identity and 
mention his postgraduate degrees from Charles 
University, Prague, and Heidelberg, he might have made 
contact with senior members of the Institute. But posing 
as photographer and cameraman without higher education 
he had no worthwhile opportunity to do so.^^ In 1970, 
unreasonably dissatisfied with Valoushek’s progress, the 
Centre took him off the Hudson Institute assignment.^^ 

The Vaklousheks’ elder son, Peter Herrmann, bom in 
1957, had a brilliant school academic record and was 
expected to have opportunities to recmit within American 
universities that his parents did not. In 1972 Valoushek 
revealed his tme identity to Peter, told the Centre he had 
done so and said that his son was ready to join the KGB. 



Moscow accepted the offer and agreed to pay Peter’s 
university fees. In the summer of 1975, shortly before 
entering McGill University in Montreal, Peter began 
training in Moscow and started his career as an illegal 
with the German codename ERBE (“Inheritor”). In 1976 
he moved from McGill to Georgetown University, where 
he was instructed to report on students whose fathers had 
government jobs (especially if they had character flaws 
which could be exploited), as well as on “progressive” 
students and professors opposed to the imperialist policies 
of the United States. He was also told to try to find a part- 
time job in the Georgetown Center for Strategic and 
International Studies, make friends with Chinese students 
and discover as much as possible about them.^^ 

By the end of the academic year, Peter Herrmann’s 
brief career as a teenage illegal was over. Early in May 
1977 Valoushek was arrested by the FBI and given the 
choice of being charged with espionage, together with his 
wife and son, or of working as a double agent. He later 
told the espionage writer John Barron that after his arrest 
he worked as a double agent under FBI control for over 
two years until the Bureau discontinued the operation. 
“Rudi [Valoushek] gave us his word and he kept it,” the 
FBI told Barron. “We must keep our word to him.” On 
September 23, 1979 an unmarked furniture van removed 
all the contents of the “Herrmann” household in Andover 
Road, Hartsdale. The Valoushek family left to start new 
lives elsewhere under new identities. 



Valoushek’s KGB file, however, gives a very different 
account of his relations with the FBI. For well over a year 
after his arrest, he included deliberate errors and warning 
signs in his messages to the Centre as an indication that 
he was working under instructions from the FBI. The 
KGB failed to notice that anything was wrong until it was 
warned by an agent early in October 1978 that Valoushek 
had been turned. Soon afterwards the Centre summoned 
him to a meeting in Mexico City with the Washington 
deputy resident, Yuri Konstantinovich Linkov 
(codenamed BUROV). The FBI told him to keep the 
rendezvous in order to continue the double agent 
deception. Valoushek began his meeting with Linkov by 
admitting that he and his family had been under Bureau 
control since the spring of the previous year. He suspected 
that he had been betrayed by LUTZEN, who had defected 
in West Germany in 1969.^^ He complained that he had 
done his best to warn the Centre, but that no one had paid 
attention to his warnings. A subsequent investigation by 
the counter-intelligence department of the FCD Illegals 
Directorate uncovered an extraordinary tale of 
incompetence. A series of warnings and deliberate errors 
in Valoushek’s communications since May 1977 had been 
overlooked and messages he had posted to the residencies 
in Vienna and Mexico City had simply been ignored.^ ^ 
Immediately after Valoushek’s warning to the KGB in 
Mexico City in October 1978, the KGB warned 
Hambleton that contact with his controller would be 



temporarily broken for security reasons. Instead of being 
told that Valoushek had defected, however, he was simply 
given a vague warning that “progressive” people and 
organizations were under increased surveillance. He was 
instructed to destroy all compromising materials and to 
deny everything if he was questioned. In case of 
emergency, he was advised to escape to East Germany. 
Hambleton, however, remained confident that he had 
covered sufficient of his tracks to prevent a case from 
being brought against him. In June 1979 he sent a 
confident message to the KGB in secret writing, saying 
that there was no cause for alarm.^^ 

At 7:15 a.m. on November 4, 1979 RCMP officers 
arrived at Hambleton’ s Quebec City apartment with a 
search warrant. For the next two and a half years there 
was extensive press speculation and numerous questions 
about Hambleton in the Canadian parliament, but no 
Canadian prosecution. On March 3, 1980, the first day of 
the new Trudeau administration, the FBI made an 
apparent attempt to force its hand by producing 
Valoushek (under a pseudonym) for a press conference at 
Bureau headquarters, where he publicly identified 
Hambleton as one of his agents. Hambleton shrugged off 
the charges. Though appearing to revel in detailed 
descriptions of his secret contacts with Moscow by short- 
wave radio and other hocus pocus, he insisted that he was 
not a spy: “A spy is someone who regularly gets secret 
material, passes it on, takes orders, and gets paid for it. I 



have never been paid.”^^ According to Hambleton’s KGB 
file, however, between September 1975 and December 
1978 alone he was paid 18,000 dollars. In May 1980 the 
Canadian Ministry of Justice, apparently convinced that 
there was still insufficient evidence, announced that 
Hambleton would not be prosecuted. Thereafter media 
interest in the case gradually died down. Two years later, 
however, Hambleton was arrested during a visit to 
London, tried under the Official Secrets Act and 
sentenced to ten years in jail.^^ 

Valoushek’s intended successor as illegal resident in 
the United States was probably Klementi Alekseyevich 
Korsakov, codenamed KIM, bom in 1948 in Moscow to a 
Russian father and a German mother. Korsakov’s mother, 
who died in 1971, had herself been a KGB illegal, 
codenamed EVA. Korsakov seems to have been selected 
as a potential illegal while still a child and, like his 
mother, was given bogus identity documents by the East 
Germans. According to his legend, Korsakov was 
Klemens Oskar Kuitan, an illegitimate child bom in 
Dalleghof in 1948. Like many other Soviet illegals, he 
and his mother posed as East German refugees, entering 
West Berlin in 1953 and moving to the ERG a year later. 
In 1967, at the age of eighteen, Korsakov obtained a West 
German passport. After his mother’s death, he spent 
several years in Vienna, first at an art school, then taking 
an advertising course, while simultaneously training 



secretly for illegal intelligence work. In 1978, after two 
transatlantic trips to familiarize himself with life in the 
United States, he moved to New York. 

Once he had begun work as a KGB illegal, however, 
Korsakov quickly became disillusioned. In January 1980, 
while undergoing further training in Moscow, he secretly 
entered the United States embassy, identified himself as 
an illegal, gave the identities of a number of other KGB 
officers (among them Artur Viktorovich Pyatin, head of 
Line N (illegals support) in Washington) and was 
debriefed by the CIA station. Since Korsakov was 
nominally a West German citizen, it was decided to 
transfer him secretly to the embassy of the FRG to 
arrange for his exfiltration. Mitrokhin’s notes do not 
record whether the KGB had observed him entering the 
American embassy, but they were waiting for him when 
he arrived at Moscow airport to return to the West. After 
lengthy interrogation, Korsakov was sent to the 
Kazanskaya psychiatric hospital, where, like a number of 
prominent Soviet dissidents, he was falsely diagnosed as 
schizophrenic.^^ 

THIRTY YEARS AFTER the beginning of the Cold War, 
the Centre’s grand strategy for a powerful chain of illegal 
residencies running American agent networks as 
important as those during the Second World War had 
little to show for an enormous expenditure of time and 
effort. At the end of the 1970s, following a string of 



previous failures, Valoushek’s illegal residency was under 
the (albeit imperfect) control of the FBI and Korsakov 
was preparing to defect. 

Particularly galling for the Centre was the fact that 
probably the most remarkable penetration of the Main 
Adversary by an illegal during the Cold War was 
achieved not by the KGB but by its junior partner, the 
Czechoslovak StB. In 1965 two StB illegals, Karl and 
Hana Koecher, arrived in New York, claiming to be 
refugees from persecution in Czechoslovakia. Fluent in 
Russian, English and French as well as Czech, Karl 
Koecher found a job as a consultant with Radio Free 
Europe while studying first for a master’s degree at 
Indiana University, then for a doctorate at Columbia. 
Among his professors at Columbia was Zbigniew 
Brzezinski, who later became President Carter’s National 
Security Adviser. All the time, he posed as a virulent anti- 
communist, even objecting to the purchase of an 
apartment in his East Side building in New York by the 
tennis star Ivan Lendl — simply because of Lendl’s Czech 
origins. In 1969, a year before gaining his PhD, Karl 
Koecher was appointed lecturer in philosophy at Wagner 
College, Staten Island. Hana, meanwhile, worked for a 
diamond business which gave her regular opportunities to 
travel to Europe and act as courier for the StB. The 
Koechers may also have been the most sexually active 
illegals in the history of Soviet Bloc intelligence, 
graduating from “wifeswapping” parties to group orgies 



at New York’s Plato’s Retreat and Hell Fire sex clubs 
which flourished in the sexually permissive pre-AIDS era 
of the late 1960s and 1970s. 

With the blessing of the StB, the Koechers later 
revealed some of their colorful careers to the Washington 
investigative journalist Ronald Kessler.^^ Karl Koecher’s 
KGB file, however, reveals that he withheld important 
details. In 1970 he was summoned back to Prague to take 
part in an StB active measure designed to unmask alleged 
CIA operations using Czech emigres. Koecher, however, 
was too attached to his swinging lifestyle to leave New 
York, refused to return and for the next four years broke 
off contact with the StB.^^ In 1971 he succeeded in 
becoming a naturalized US citizen; his wife was granted 
citizenship a year later. 

Karl Koecher seems to have devised a plan to mend his 
fences with the StB by penetrating the CIA. In 1973 he 
moved to Washington and obtained a job as translator in 
the Agency’s Soviet division, with a top secret security 
clearance. His chutzpah was such that only three weeks 
later he demanded a better job: 

My present position is by no means one which would 
require a PhD. I am interested in intelligence work, 
and I want to stay with the agency and do a good 
piece of work. But I also think that it would only be 
fair to let me do it in a position intellectually far 
more demanding than the one I have now ... 



Probably as a result of his complaints, Koecher was later 
asked to write intelligence assessments based on some of 
the Russian and Czech material which he translated and 
transcribed from tape recordings. 

Sex in Washington struck Koecher as even more 
exciting than in New York. In the mid-1970s, he later 
claimed nostalgically, Washington was “the sex capital of 
the world.” The Koechers joined the “Capitol Couples,” 
who met for dinner at The Exchange restaurant on 
Saturday evenings before moving on for group sex in a 
hotel or private house, as well as becoming members of a 
private club of Washington swingers at Virginia’s In 
Place, about ten of whose members worked for the CIA. 
Hana, blonde, attractive and ten years younger than her 
husband, later boasted that she had had sex with 
numerous CIA personnel. Pentagon officials, reporters 
from major newspapers and a US Senator. The organizer 
of “Capitol Couples” remembered her as “strikingly 
beautiful; warm, sweet, ingratiating; incredibly 
orgasmic.” Karl, however, “was a bit strange ... The 
women he was with said he was a terrible lover, very 
insensitive. His wife was everything he wasn’t.”^^ 

In 1974, having penetrated the CIA, Karl Koecher 
renewed contact with the StB, which consulted the KGB 
about whether to reactivate him. Henceforth he became a 
KGB agent with the codename RING, as well as being an 
StB illegal. The Koechers’ adventures in Washington sex 



clubs are unlikely to have provided the StB and KGB with 
more than compromising information and gossip about 
Washington officials, most of it of no operational 
significance. Far more important was the classified Soviet 
and Czech material translated by Karl Koecher for the 
CIA which he forwarded to the KGB. Andropov 
personally praised his intelligence as “important and 
valuable. In 1975 Koecher left full-time Agency 
employment, but continued on contract work, based in 
New York. Among the subjects of his assessments was 
the decision-making process in the Soviet leadership.^ ^ 

In 1975 Koecher supplied the KGB’s New York 
residency with highly rated intelligence on CIA 
operations against the Soviet Union in the Third World. 
As well as arranging meetings in New York, his KGB 
case officers also met him in Austria and France. 
Among his most important counter-intelligence leads was 
evidence that the CIA had recruited a Soviet diplomat. 
Following an apparently lengthy investigation, the KGB 
identified the diplomat as Aleksandr Dmitryevich 
Ogorodnik, then working in the American department at 
the Foreign Ministry. Soon after his arrest in 1977, 
Ogorodnik agreed to write a full confession but 
complained that the pen given him by his interrogator was 
too clumsy for him to use. As soon as he was given his 
own pen back, he removed a concealed poison capsule, 
swallowed it before the guard could stop him and died in 



the interrogation room.^^ 

In the early 1980s the Koechers were themselves 
betrayed by a CIA agent in the StB. Arrested in 1984, 
they returned to Czechoslovakia less than two years later 
as part of a deal which allowed the imprisoned Russian 
dissident Anatoli Shcharansky to emigrate to Israel. 
According to a newspaper report, as they crossed the 
Glienicker Bridge from West Berlin to East Germany: 

With his moustache and fur-lined coat, Karl F. 
Koecher looked like nothing so much as a fox. His 
wife, Hana, wore a mink coat and high white mink 
hat. Blonde and sexy, with incredibly large blue 
eyes, she looked like a movie star. 

“The KGB thinks highly of me,” Karl Koecher later 
boasted to Ronald Kessler. There was a curious sequel 
to the Koechers’ espionage careers in the West. In 1992 
Hana succeeded in obtaining a job in the commercial 
section at the British embassy in Prague. She was sacked 
two years later after a Czech journalist revealed her 
background. 

AT THE BEGINNING of the 1980s, despite all the 
setbacks of the previous thirty years, the Centre’s plans 
for the expansion of illegal networks on the territory of 
the Main Adversary still remained remarkably ambitious 
— though not to quite the same degree as a decade earlier. 



Instead of the ten illegal residencies which it had intended 
to establish within the United States by 1975, the Centre 
planned to have six by 1982. Between them, the six 
residencies were supposed to have three to four sources in 
each of a series of major penetration targets: the White 
House, the State Department, the Pentagon and what were 
described as “related institutions” — among them the 
Hudson Institute, the Rand Corporation, Columbia 
University’s School of International Relations, 
Georgetown University’s Center for Strategic Studies and 
the West German affiliates of Stanford University’s 
Center for Strategy and Research. The Centre also 
planned the “active recruitment” of students at Columbia, 
New York and Georgetown Universities.^^ 

It is clear that the KGB had some success in deploying 
illegals against the Main Adversary in the 1980s. For 
example, Mitrokhin’s notes record that in 1983 the illegal 
couple GORT and LUIZA were operating in the United 
States, but give no details of their achievements.^^ 
However, even the KGB’s downgraded plan for six illegal 
residencies, each with agents at the heart of the Reagan 
administration, was hopelessly unrealistic. The scale of 
the Centre’s ambitious projects for illegal operations 
against the Main Adversary in the later years of the Cold 
War reflected not the reality of the 1980s but the spell still 
cast by the triumphs of the Great Illegals half a century 
before. 



THIRTEEN 


THE MAIN ADVERSARY 


Part 4: Walk-ins and Legal Residencies in the Later Cold 

War 


Yuri Andropov became KGB chairman in 1967 with 
extravagant expectations of the potential contribution of 
political intelligence to Soviet foreign policy, particularly 
towards the United States. In a report to KGB Party 
activists soon after his appointment, he declared that the 
KGB must be in a position to influence the outcome of 
international crises in a way that it had failed to do during 
the Cuban missile crisis five years earlier. He ordered the 
preparation within three to four months of a First Chief 
(Foreign Intelligence) Directorate report to the Central 
Committee on the current and future policy of the Main 
Adversary and its allies. The principal weakness of 
current operations in the United States, Andropov 



complained, was the lack of American agents of the 
caliber of the Britons Kim Philby, George Blake and John 
Vassall, or the West German Heinz Felfe. Only by 
recruiting such agents, he insisted, could the FCD gain 
access to really high-grade intelligence.^ 

Almost from the moment he became a candidate (non- 
voting) member of the Politburo in 1967, Andropov 
established himself as a powerful voice in Soviet foreign 
policy. In 1968 he emerged as the chief spokesman of 
those calling for “extreme measures” to crush the Prague 
Spring.^ During the 1970s he became co-sponsor, with the 
foreign minister, Andrei Gromyko, of the main foreign 
policy proposals brought before the Politburo (of which 
both were full, voting members from 1973). Dmitri 
Ustinov, who became Defense Minister in 1977, 
sometimes added his signature to the proposals worked 
out with Gromyko. According to the long- serving Soviet 
ambassador in Washington, Anatoli Dobrynin: 

Andropov had the advantage of familiarity with both 
foreign policy and military issues from the KGB’s 
broad sources of information ... Gromyko and 
Ustinov were authorities in their respective domains 
but laid no special claim to each other’s fields in the 
way that Andropov felt comfortable in both.^ 

Under Andropov, the FCD, which had traditionally been 
wary of taking the initiative in issuing intelligence 



assessments, for fear that they might contradict the 
opinions of higher authority, reformed and expanded its 
analytical branch.^ On a number of occasions Andropov 
circulated slanted assessments to the Politburo in an 
attempt to influence its policy.^ 

Andropov became one of Brezhnev’s most trusted 
advisers. In January 1976, for example, he sent the 
General Secretary a strictly personal eighteen-page letter, 
which began sycophantically: 

This document, which I wrote myself, is intended for 
you alone. If you find something in it of value to the 
cause, I shall be very glad, and if not, then I ask you 
to consider it as never having happened.^ 

Though careful not to criticize Brezhnev even in private 
discussions with senior KGB officers,^ Andropov was 
well aware of both his intellectual limitations and 
declining health, and set out to establish himself as heir- 
apparent. The General Secretary paid little attention to the 
details of foreign policy. Dobrynin quickly discovered 
that what most interested Brezhnev about foreign affairs 
were the pomp and circumstance of ceremonial occasions: 

... the guards of honor, the grand receptions for 
foreign leaders in the Kremlin, the fulsome publicity, 
and all the rest. He wanted his photo taken for his 
albums, which he loved to show. He much preferred 



a fine ceremony signing final documents rather than 
working on them. 

During one meeting with Dobrynin, Brezhnev 
disappeared upstairs and reemerged in field marshal’s 
uniform, his chest clanking with medals. “How do I 
look?” he asked. “Magnificent!” Dobrynin dutifully 
replied.^ From 1974 onwards a series of mild strokes 
caused by arteriosclerosis of the brain left Brezhnev a 
semi-invalid. At the rear of the cavalcade of black Zil 
limousines which accompanied Brezhnev wherever he 
went was a resuscitation vehicle. By the mid-1970s one of 
his closest companions was a KGB nurse, who fed him a 
steady stream of pills without consulting his doctors.^ 

THOUGH ANDROPOV STRENGTHENED both his 
own influence and that of the KGB in the making of 
Soviet foreign policy, his ambitious plans for dramatically 
improved political intelligence on the Main Adversary 
were never realized. Line PR (political intelligence) in the 
American residencies failed to live up to his high 
expectations. In 1968, a scandal arose over the New York 
resident, Nikolai Panteleymonovich Kulebyakin, a former 
head of the FCD First (North American) Department. 
After the Centre had received a complaint against him, 
probably from within his residency, an enquiry revealed 
that he had entered the KGB with a bogus curriculum 
vitae. Contrary to the claims in his CV, he had never 



completed his school education and had evaded military 
service. Fearing that Kulebyakin might defect if he were 
confronted with his crimes in Washington, he was told he 
had been promoted to deputy director of the FCD and 
summoned home to take up his new office. On arriving in 
Moscow, however, he was summarily dismissed from the 
KGB and expelled from the Communist Party. 

Thanks chiefly to two walk-ins. Line PR in Washington 
performed rather better than New York during the mid- 
and late 1960s. In September 1965 Robert Lipka, a 
twenty-year-old army clerk in NS A, caused great 
excitement in the Washington residency by presenting 
himself at the Soviet embassy on Sixteenth Street, a few 
blocks from the White House, and announcing that he was 
responsible for shredding highly classified documents. 
Lipka (code-named DAN) was probably the youngest 
Soviet agent recruited in the United States with access to 
high-grade intelligence since the nineteen-year-old Ted 
Hall had offered his services to the New York residency 
while working on the MANHATTAN project at Los 
Alamos in 1944. Lipka’ s file notes that he quickly 
mastered the intelligence tradecraft taught him by Line 
PR. Over the next two years he made contact with the 
residency about fifty times via dead letter-boxes, brush 
contacts and meetings with a case officer. ^ ^ 

The youthful head of Line PR, Oleg Danilovich 
Kalugin, spent “countless hours” in his cramped office in 
the Washington residency sifting through the mass of 



material provided by Lipka and choosing the most 
important documents for cabling to Moscow. Lipka’ s 
motives were purely mercenary. During the two years 
after he walked into the Washington embassy, he received 
a total of about 27,000 dollars, but regularly complained 
that he was not paid enough and threatened to break 
contact unless his remuneration was increased. Lipka 
eventually did break contact in August 1967, when he left 
NS A at the end of his military service to study at 
Millersville College in Pennsylvania and probably 
concluded that his loss of intelligence access made it no 
longer worth his while maintaining contact with the 
Washington residency. To discourage the KGB from 
trying to renew contact, Lipka sent a final message 
claiming that he had been a double agent controlled by 
US intelligence. In view of the importance of the 
classified documents he had provided, however, the KGB 
had no doubt that he was lying. Attempts by both the 
residency and illegals to renew contact with Lipka 
continued intermittently, without success, for at least 
another eleven years. 

Only a few months after Lipka ceased working as a 
Soviet agent, the Washington residency recruited another 
walk-in with access to SIGINT. The most important Cold 
War agent recruited in Washington before Aldrich Ames 
walked in in 1985 was probably Chief Warrant Officer 
John Anthony Walker, a communications watch officer 
on the staff of the Commander of Submarine Forces in the 



Atlantic (COMSUBLANT) in Norfolk, Virginia. Late in 
1967 he entered the Soviet embassy and announced, “I’m 
a naval officer. I’d like to make some money and I’ll give 
you some genuine stuff in return.” Despite his junior rank. 
Walker had access to very high-level intelligence — 
including the key settings of US naval ciphers. The 
sample batch of his material, which he brought with him 
to the embassy, was examined with amazement by 
Kalugin and the Washington resident, Boris 
Aleksandrovich Solomatin. According to Kalugin, 
Solomatin’s “eyes widened as he leafed through the 
Walker papers. ‘I want this!’ he cried.” Walker, they later 
agreed, was the kind of spy who turns up “once in a 
lifetime.” Enabling Soviet codebreakers to crack US navy 
codes, claims Kalugin, gave the Soviet Union “an 
enormous intelligence advantage” by allowing it to 
monitor American fleet movements. 

Walker, described in a fitness report from his 
commanding officer in 1972 as “intensely loyal” with “a 
fine sense of personal honor and integrity,” found 
photographing top secret documents and cipher material 
with a Minox camera in the COMSUBLANT 
communications center so easy that he was later to claim, 
“K Mart has better security than the Navy.” He went on to 
form a spy-ring by recruiting a naval friend, Jerry 
Whitworth, and his own son and elder brother. For 
Kalugin the greatest surprise of both the Lipka and 
Walker cases was their revelation of “how incredibly lax 



security still was at some of the United States’ top secret 
installations.”^^ 

After the foundation in 1968 of the ultra-secret 
Sixteenth Department to handle SIGINT material 
collected by the FCD, Walker was transferred to its 
control and thus no longer figured on the Washington 
residency’s agent list.^^ Solomatin, however, was careful 
to ensure that he retained personal oversight of the 
running of what became the Walker family spyring 
throughout the extraordinary eighteen years of its 
existence. The reflected glory of the Lipka and Walker 
cases was to win Solomatin the Order of the Red Banner 
and, later, promotion to deputy head of the FCD. 
Kalugin’s career also benefited; in 1974 he became the 
FCD’s youngest general. 

Most walk-ins were less straightforward than Lipka and 
Walker. During the 1970s KGB residencies, especially 
that in Mexico City, had to deal with a growing number of 
“dangles” — double agents controlled by the US 
intelligence community who offered their services as 
Soviet agents. One of the most successful dangles was 
MAREK, a master sergeant of Czech descent at the Fort 
Bliss army base in Texas, who visited the Soviet embassy 
in Mexico in December 1966 and offered information on 
electronic equipment used by the US army. Recruited in 
June 1968, he had numerous meetings over the next eight 
years with a grand total of twenty-six case officers in 



Mexico, West Germany, Switzerland, Japan and Austria. 
In May 1976, however, the KGB learned from the former 
CIA officer Philip Agee (PONT) that MAREK was a US 
dangle, run in a joint CIA/Defense Intelligence Agency 
operation of which he had personal knowledge. 

By the late 1970s a special Pentagon panel was 
selecting classified documents which were given to 
American dangles, mostly non-commissioned officers 
selected by the DIA to strengthen their credibility as 
Soviet spies. As well as providing a potential channel for 
disinformation in a conflict or crisis, large amounts of 
KGB time and energy were wasted in distinguishing 
dangles from genuine walk-ins. The most successful of 
the real Soviet recruits, Aldrich Ames, said later that the 
refusal of the Red Army to release classified documents 
made it impossible for Soviet dangles to compete with 
those of the United States: 

Even if a document were of no real value, no one in 
the Soviet military was willing to sign off on 
releasing it, knowing that it was going to be passed 
to the West. They were afraid that a few months 
later, they would be called before some Stalin-like 
tribunal and be shot for treason.^ ^ 

Throughout the Cold War the main weakness of the 
Washington residency was its inability to recruit agents 
able to provide high-level political intelligence from 



within the federal government. At the end of the 1960s, 
however, it had one non-agent source to which it attached 
great importance. A line PR officer, Boris Sedov, 
operating under cover as a Novosti journalist, had 
succeeded in making contact with Henry Kissinger while 
he was still a professor at Harvard University. According 
to Kalugin, “We never had any illusions about trying to 
recruit Kissinger: he was simply a source of political 
intelligence.” When Kissinger became an adviser to 
Nixon during the 1968 election campaign, he began to use 
Sedov to pass messages to Moscow that Nixon’s public 
image as an unreconstructed Cold War warrior was false 
and that he wanted better relations with the Soviet Union. 
After Nixon’s election victory, Brezhnev sent personal 
congratulations to him via Sedov together with a note 
expressing the hope that together they would establish 
better US — Soviet relations. While the presidential 
campaign had been underway, the long-serving Soviet 
ambassador, Anatoli Dobrynin, had tolerated Sedov’s 
secret contacts with Kissinger. Once Nixon entered the 
White House and Kissinger became his National Security 
Adviser, however, he insisted on taking over the back 
channel to the Kremlin himself. 

When Kissinger took over as Secretary of State in 
1973, Dobrynin became the only ambassador in 
Washington who was allowed to enter the State 
Department unobserved via the underground garage.^^ 
The Washington residency complained to the Centre that 



Kissinger had forbidden his officials to meet members of 
the Soviet embassy outside office hours, thus making it 
impossible for residency officers to develop contacts of 
their own within the State Department and “check 
Kissinger’s true intentions when negotiating with 
Ambassador Dobrynin.”^^ During his twenty-three years 
in Washington from 1963 to 1986, Dobrynin’s access to a 
series of major policy-makers from Dean Rusk under 
Kennedy to George Shultz under Reagan was never 
equaled by the Washington residency. 

Line PR at the New York residency had no success in 
recruiting “valuable agents” within the US administration 
either. The United Nations, however, was a much softer 
target. Of the more than 300 Soviet nationals employed in 
the UN Secretariat, many were KGB and GRU officers, 
agents and co-optees. KGB officers operating under 
diplomatic cover became the trusted personal assistants to 
successive UN secretaries-general: Viktor 

Mechislavovich Lesiovsky to U Thant, Lesiovsky and 
Valeri Viktorovich Krepkogorsky to Kurt Waldheim and 
Gennadi Mikhaylovich Yevstafeyev to Javier Perez de 
Cuellar.^^ The KGB made strenuous attempts to cultivate 
Waldheim in particular, arranging for the publication of 
flattering articles about him in the Soviet press and 
selecting a painting of Samarkand by a Soviet artist which 
was personally presented to him by Lesiovsky and 
Krepkogorsky when he visited the USSR.^^ 



According to Arkadi Nikolayevich Shevchenko, the 
Russian under secretary-general at the UN who defected 
in 1978, Lesiovsky and Krepkogorsky were given largely 
routine responsibilities by Waldheim, checking the order 
of speakers at the General Assembly or representing him 
at innumerable diplomatic receptions, but were frozen out 
of sensitive UN business by what they claimed was 
Waldheim’s “Austrian mafia.” The UN Secretariat in 
New York none the less became a much more successful 
recruiting ground than the federal government in 
Washington. Shevchenko frequently saw Lesiovsky in the 
delegates’ lounge, “buying drinks for an ambassador, 
telling amusing stories, procuring hard-to-get theater or 
opera tickets, name dropping, ingratiating himself. The 
Secretary-General’s KGB personal assistants spent much 
of their time cultivating and trying to recruit members of 
foreign missions and the UN Secretariat from around the 
world.^^ 

The Centre, however, frequently expressed 
disappointment with political intelligence operations by 
the New York residency outside the United Nations. The 
residency’s work was seriously disrupted in 1973 when it 
discovered that the FBI had detailed information on the 
activities of some of its operations officers, as well as of 
three “developmental” agents (codenamed GREK, 
BREST and BRIZ).^^ A report at the end of 1974 
concluded that Line PR’s performance had been 



unsatisfactory for some time past: 


For a number of years the Residency has not been 
able to create an agent network capable of fulfilling 
the complex requirements of our intelligence work, 
especially against the US We have not succeeded in 
achieving this goal in 1974, either, although there 
has been some progress in this line. There have been 
several recruitments (SUAREZ, DIF, HERMES) and 
confidential contacts have been acquired. But these 
results still do not move us any closer to fulfilling 
our basic task.^^ 

None of the three new agents was of major significance. 
SUAREZ was a Colombian journalist recruited by 
Anatoli Mikhailovich Manakov, a KGB officer operating 
under cover as Komsomolskaya Pravda correspondent in 
New York. A few years later SUAREZ succeeded in 
gaining US citizenship.^^ DIF was a US businessman who 
provided political and economic assessments.^^ 
HERMES, potentially the most important of the three new 
recruits, was Ozdemir Ahmet Ozgur, a Cypriot bom in 
1929. In 1977, the New York residency was able to 
arrange through Arkadi Shevchenko for Ozgur to gain a 
post at the UN Secretariat. When Shevchenko defected in 
1978, however, the KGB was forced to break off all 
contact with HERMES. 

DIF, the US businessman, was also included in the 



Washington residency’s list of its Line PR agents in 1974. 
Line PR had nine other agents: GRIG, MAGYAR, 
MORTON, NIK, RAMZES, REM, ROMELLA, SHEF 
and STOIC. GRIG remains unidentified but is reported 
as operating in Canada.^^ MAGYAR was a leading peace 
activist. MORTON was a prominent lawyer recruited in 
1970 but taken off the agent list in 1975 because of his 
advancing years. On his retirement he put the Washington 
residency in touch with his son, who was also a partner in 
a well-known law firm.^^ NIK was a Colombian who 
worked on US — Colombian cultural exchange 
programs. RAMZES was an American professor with 
contacts in Congress, academe, the press and Latin 
America.^^ REM was an Italian employee of the UN 
Secretariat.^^ ROMELLA was a Latin American diplomat 
in the UN Secretariat, who made contact with the KGB to 
seek its help in renewing her contract at the UN before it 
expired in 1975; she supplied both classified documents 
and recruitment leads. SHEF was a professor at 
McMaster University, recruited during a visit to Lithuania 
in 1974.^^ STOIC was a Latin American diplomat in the 
UN Secretariat. As in New York, none of the 
Washington Line PR agents had high-level access to any 
branch of the federal government. 

Though the New York residency had some successes in 
electronic eavesdropping, in active measures and in 
scientific and technological intelligence, its Line PR 



network mostly consisted of agents at the UN and in 
emigre communities, only a minority of whom had US 
citizenship.^^ The largest concentration of agents was 
within the Soviet colony itself, most of whom inhabited 
the residential complex in Riverdale. According to KGB 
statistics, in 1975 the colony numbered 1,366 Soviet 
employees and dependents. Of the 533 employees, 
seventy-six were officially classed as agents and sixteen 
as “trusted contacts. Most, however, were chiefly 
concerned with informing on their colleagues to Line SK 
(Soviet Colony) in the residency. The Centre’s assessment 
in 1974 stressed the limitations of Line PR’s New York 
agents: 

Not one of these agents has access to secret 
American information. The basic thrust of operations 
with this network therefore consists of using it for 
the collection of information from UN diplomatic 
sources, and from several American [non-agent] 
sources.^^ 

Lacking any high-level agents in the federal 
government. Line PR officers in New York and 
Washington, usually operating under cover as diplomats 
or journalists, devoted much of their time to collecting 
insider gossip from well-placed non-agent sources in 
Congress and the press corps. As head of Line PR in 
Washington from 1965 to 1970, Kalugin got to know the 



columnists Walter Lippmann, Joseph Kraft and Drew 
Pearson; Chalmers Roberts and Murray Marder of the 
Washington Post; Joseph Harsch of the Christian Science 
Monitor; Carl Rowan, former director of the US 
Information Agency; and Henry Brandon of the London 
Times. Kalugin’s role when he called at their offices or 
lunched with them in Washington restaurants was not that 
of agent controller or recruiter. Instead, he “would act like 
a good reporter,” carefully noting their assessments of the 
current political situation: “Rarely did I come up with a 
scoop for the Politburo, but the reporting of our [PR] 
section enabled Soviet leaders to have a better sense of 
American political realities ...” During the 1968 
presidential election campaign some of Kalugin’s sources 
provided corroboration for Sedov’s reports, based on 
conversations with Kissinger, that, if elected, Nixon 
would prove much less anti-Soviet than Moscow feared. 
One of Kalugin’s most important contacts was Senator 
Robert Kennedy who, but for his assassination just after 
he had won the California presidential primary, might 
have won the 1968 Democratic nomination. Before his 
death Kennedy presented Kalugin with a tie-pin showing 
the PT-109 torpedo boat which his brother had captained 
during the war. Line PR officers in Washington also had 
regular meetings with such leading senators as Mike 
Mansfield, William Fulbright, Mark Hatfield, Charles 
Percy, Eugene McCarthy, George McGovern and Jacob 
Javits. The Centre liked to boast to the Politburo that its 



assessments of American policy were based on access to 
the Congressional elite.^^ 

Most of the political reporting of the Washington 
residency was thus based on non-secret sources — to the 
considerable annoyance of some of the Soviet diplomats 
whose far smaller foreign currency allowances gave them 
less freedom to entertain their contacts in Washington 
restaurants. Despite his insistence on keeping the back 
channel to himself, Dobrynin took a more benign view of 
the residency’s work, and seemed genuinely interested in 
what it discovered from both its contacts and agents. “In 
too many Soviet embassies,” Dobrynin complained, 
“normal personal relations between the ambassador and 
the KGB resident were the exception rather than the rule.” 
Ambassador and resident frequently became locked in 
bitter rivalry as each sought “to show who really was the 
boss in the embassy” and to demonstrate to Moscow the 
superiority of his own sources of information.^^ 

As resident in Washington from 1965 to 1968 
Solomatin had got on well with Dobrynin. When he 
became resident in New York in 1971, however, he 
quickly began to feud with Yakov Malik, the Soviet 
representative at the United Nations. Malik strongly 
objected to Solomatin’ s attempts to develop contacts 
whom he wished to cultivate himself — among them 
David Rockefeller, brother of Nelson and chairman of 
Chase Manhattan Bank.^^ Malik was fascinated by 



Rockefeller’s 30,000-name card file of his contacts 
around the world, cross-indexed by country, city and 
business. On a visit to the chairman’s sprawling 
seventeenth-floor office at the sixty-story Chase 
Manhattan building, Malik asked to see a sample from the 
file. Rockefeller picked out the card for Khrushchev.^^ 
Malik also vigorously opposed Solomatin’s contacts with 
the veteran diplomat Averell Harriman, regarded in 
Moscow as one of the most influential American 
advocates of better relations with the Soviet Union. In 
co-operation with Dobrynin, Harriman later returned from 
retirement to act as unofficial channel of communication 
between Brezhnev and Jimmy Carter during the transition 
period after Carter’s 1976 election victory. Solomatin 
complained to the Centre that Malik’s objections to his 
attempts to cultivate Rockefeller and Harriman were 
“characteristic” of his general obstructionism. He 
failed, however, to tell the Centre that there was not the 
slightest prospect of recruiting either Rockefeller or 
Harriman. 

In an attempt to improve the quality of agent 
recruitment in the United States, the director of the 
Institute of Psychology in the Academy of Sciences, Boris 
Fyodorovich Lomov, a “trusted contact” of the KGB, was 
sent in 1975 to advise the New York residency on 
techniques of cultivation.^^ In 1976 the Centre devised an 
elaborate incentive scheme to reward successful 



recruiters, with inducements ranging from medals and 
letters of appreciation to accelerated promotion, new 
apartments and cash bonuses in hard currency (which 
would make possible the purchase of Western consumer 
goods that could be shipped back to Moscow at the end of 
the officer’s tour of duty).^^ 

As chairman of the KGB, Andropov seemed unable to 
grasp the difficulties of penetrating the US administration. 
During the mid-1970s he initiated a series of hopelessly 
impracticable recruitment schemes. Following Nixon’s 
resignation in August 1974 after the Watergate scandal, 
Andropov instructed the Washington residency to 
establish contact with five members of the former 
administration: Pat Buchanan and William Safire, former 
advisers and speechwriters to Nixon; Richard Allen, 
Deputy National Security Adviser during the first year of 
Nixon’s administration; C. Fred Bergsten, an economist 
on the National Security Council (NSC); and S. Everett 
Gleason, an NSC veteran who died three months after 
Nixon’s resignation. All were wildly improbable 
recruits. In 1975 Andropov personally approved a series 
of equally improbable operations designed to penetrate 
the “inner circles” of a series of well-known public 
figures: among them George Ball, Ramsey Clark, 
Kenneth Galbraith, Averell Harriman, Teddy Kennedy 
and Theodore Sorensen. Somewhat humiliatingly for 
the FCD, the KGB’s most productive agent during the 



1976 election campaign was a Democratic activist with 
access to the Carter camp who had been recruited during a 
visit to Russia by the Second Chief Directorate.^^ 

The KGB’s most successful strategy for cultivating 
American policy-makers was to use the prestigious 
academic cover of the Moscow Institute of the United 
States and Canada. The secret 1968 statute of the institute 
kept at the Centre authorized the KGB to task it to 
research aspects of the Main Adversary which were of 
interest to it, to provide KGB officers with cover 
positions, to invite prominent American policy-makers 
and academics to Moscow and to undertake intelligence- 
related missions to the United States. Among the KGB’s 
cover positions at the institute was that of deputy director, 
occupied by Colonel Radimir Bogdanov (codenamed 
VLADIMIROV), sometimes described behind his back as 
“the scholar in epaulets. The KGB’s most important 
agent at the institute was its director, Georgi Arbatov, 
codenamed VASILI, who built up a large circle of high- 
level contacts in the United States and was regularly 
required to cultivate them.^^ According to Kissinger: 

[Arbatov] was especially subtle in playing to the 
inexhaustible masochism of American intellectuals 
who took it as an article of faith that every difficulty 
in US — Soviet relations had to be caused by 
American stupidity or intransigence. He was 
endlessly ingenious in demonstrating how American 



rebuffs were frustrating the peaceful, sensitive 
leaders in the Kremlin, who were being driven 
reluctantly by our inflexibility into conflicts that 
offended their inherently gentle natures. 

Though Arbatov’s access to US policy-makers raised 
KGB hopes of a major penetration of the federal 
government, Mitrokhin found no evidence in the files of 
any significant recruitment which resulted from it. In the 
Centre’s view, Arbatov’s most important contact during 
the 1970s was former Under- Secretary of Defense Cyrus 
Vance, codenamed VIZIR (“Vizier”). During a visit to 
Moscow in the spring of 1973, Vance unsurprisingly 
agreed with Arbatov on the need to “increase the level of 
mutual trust” in US — Soviet relations. Arbatov reported 
that he had told Vance — doubtless to no effect — that the 
majority of the American press corps in Moscow were 
propagating “a negative propagandistic” image of the 
USSR at the behest of the Zionist lobby in the United 
States. In 1976 Arbatov was sent on another mission to 
the United States. While there he claimed an addition 200 
dollars for “operational expenses” from the New York 
residency for entertaining Vance and others. From such 
inconsequential meetings the Centre briefly formed 
absurdly optimistic hopes of penetrating the new 
American administration after Jimmy Carter’s victory in 
the presidential election of November 1976 and his 
appointment of Vance as Secretary of State. On December 



19 Andropov personally approved operations against 
Vance which were probably intended to make him at least 
a “trusted contact” of the KGB. The operations were, of 
course, doomed to failure. Vance’s file records that, once 
he entered the Carter administration, any possibility of 
unofficial access to both him and his family dried up.^^ 
Doubtless to the frustration of the Centre, Ambassador 
Dobrynin continued to have a private entree to the State 
Department via its underground garage, just as he had 
done during Kissinger’s term as Secretary of State, and 
prided himself on maintaining through Vance the 
“confidential channel” between White House and Kremlin 
which the Centre had briefly deluded itself into believing 
it could take over.^^ 

The Centre’s early expectations of the Carter 
administration were so unrealistic that it even devised 
schemes to cultivate his hardline National Security 
Adviser, Zbigniew Brzezinski. The FCD drew up a plan 
to send Arbatov’s deputy, Bogdanov, whom Brzezinski 
had met previously, to Washington “to strengthen their 
relationship and to convey to him some advantageous 
information.” On January 3, 1977 Andropov also 
approved an operation to collect “compromising 
information” on Brzezinski as a means of putting pressure 
on him. Unsurprisingly, as in the case of Vance, the 
Centre’s early hopes of cultivating Brzezinski quickly 
evaporated, and the Centre concentrated instead on 



devising “active measures” to discredit him.^^ 

KGB Decree No. 0017 of May 26, 1977 declared that 
there was an urgent need for better intelligence on the 
Carter administration. The Centre’s evaluations of the 
work of the Washington and New York residencies in 
both 1977 and 1978 make clear that this requirement was 
not met. Line PR’s agent network in the United States 
was once again declared incapable of meeting the 
objectives assigned to it. Not a single agent had direct 
access to major penetration targets. 

Lacking reliable, high-level sources within the 
administration, the Centre, as frequently happened, fell 
back on conspiracy theories. Early in 1977 Vladimir 
Aleksandrovich Kryuchkov, head of the FCD and a 
protege of Andropov, submitted to him a report entitled 
“On CIA Plans to Recruit Agents Among Soviet 
Citizens,” revealing a non-existent CIA masterplan to 
sabotage Soviet administration, economic development 
and scientific research: 

... Today American intelligence is planning to recruit 
agents among Soviet citizens, train them and then 
advance them into administrative positions within 
Soviet politics, the economy and science. The CIA 
has drafted a program to subject agents to individual 
instruction in espionage techniques and also 
intensive political and ideological brainwashing ... 
The CIA intends that individual agents working in 



isolation to carry out policies of sabotage and 
distortion of superiors’ instructions will be 
coordinated from a single center within the US 
intelligence system. The CIA believes that such 
deliberate action by agents will create internal 
political difficulties for the Soviet Union, retard 
development of its economy and channel its 
scientific research into dead ends. 

Andropov considered this improbable top secret 
conspiracy theory so important that on January 24, 1977 
he forwarded it under his signature to the other members 
of the Politburo and Central Committee. 

THE CENTRE HARBORED far fewer illusions about the 
incoming Reagan administration in January 1981 than it 
had done about Carter four years earlier. Any hope that 
Reagan’s anti-Soviet speeches during the election had 
been mere campaign rhetoric quickly faded after his 
inauguration. In April 1981, after a trip to the United 
States at the Centre’s request, Arbatov sent a report on the 
new administration to Andropov and Kryuchkov. At a 
dinner in the White House he had been able to observe 
Reagan for one and a half hours from a distance of only 
fifteen meters. Though Reagan seemed to be acting the 
role of president, he played the part with genuine 
emotion. Tears came to his eyes when the flags of the four 
armed services were brought into the room and when he 



stood up and placed his hand on his heart as the national 
anthem was played. Nancy Reagan’s eyes never left her 
husband. Her adoring expression reminded Arbatov of a 
teenage girl suddenly placed next to her favorite pop star. 
Though Reagan’s speech to the assembled journalists was 
“exceptionally shallow,” the President played to 
perfection the role of “father of the nation,” a great leader 
who had kept his humanity, a sense of humor and the 
common touch. 

Both the Centre and the Kremlin took a less benign 
view of Reagan. In a secret speech to a major KGB 
conference in May 1981 a visibly ailing Brezhnev 
denounced Reagan’s policies as a serious threat to world 
peace. He was followed by Andropov, who was to 
succeed him as general secretary eighteen months later. 
To the astonishment of most of the audience, the KGB 
chairman announced that, by decision of the Politburo, the 
KGB and GRU were for the first time to collaborate in a 
global intelligence operation, codenamed RYAN — a 
newly devised acronym for Raketno-Yadernoye 
Napadenie (“Nuclear Missile Attack”). RYAN’s purpose 
was to collect intelligence on the presumed, but non- 
existent, plans of the Reagan administration to launch a 
nuclear first strike against the Soviet Union — a delusion 
which reflected both the KGB’s continuing failure to 
penetrate the policy-making of the Main Adversary and 
its recurrent tendency towards conspiracy theory.^ ^ “Not 
since the end of the Second World War,” Andropov 



informed foreign residencies, “has the international 
situation been as explosive as it is now.”^^ As Brezhnev’s 
successor in November 1982, Andropov retained full 
control over the KGB; his most frequent visitors were 
senior KGB officers.^^ Throughout his term as general 
secretary, RYAN remained the FCD’s first priority. 

For several years Moscow succumbed to what its 
ambassador in Washington, Anatoli Dobrynin, fairly 
described as a “paranoid interpretation” of Reagan’s 
policy.^^ Most residencies in Western capitals were less 
alarmist than Andropov and the KGB leadership. When 
Oleg Antonovich Gordievsky joined the London 
residency in June 1982 he found all his colleagues in Line 
PR skeptical about operation RYAN. None, however, 
were willing to risk their careers by challenging the 
Centre’s assessment. RYAN thus created a vicious circle 
of intelligence collection and assessment. Residencies 
were, in effect, ordered to search out alarming 
information. The Centre was duly alarmed by what they 
supplied and demanded more.^^ The Washington resident, 
Stanislav Andreyevich Androsov, a protege of 
Kryuchkov, was at pains to provide it.^^ 

The Centre interpreted the announcement of the SDI 
(“Star Wars”) program in March 1983 as part of the 
psychological preparation of the American people for 
nuclear war. On September 28, 1983 the terminally ill 
Andropov issued from his sickbed a denunciation of 



American policy couched in apocalyptic language 
unparalleled since the depths of the Cold War. 
“Outrageous military psychosis” had taken over the 
United States. “The Reagan administration, in its imperial 
ambitions, goes so far that one begins to doubt whether 
Washington has any brakes at all preventing it from 
crossing the point at which any sober-minded person must 
stop.” Alarm within the Centre reached a climax during 
the NATO exercise “Able Archer 83,” held in November 
1983 to practice nuclear release procedures. For a time the 
KGB leadership was haunted by the fear that the exercise 
might be intended as cover for a nuclear first strike. Some 
FCD officers stationed in the West were by now more 
concerned by the alarmism in the Centre than by the 
threat of a Western surprise attack. 

Operation RYAN wound down (though it did not end) 
during 1984, helped by the death of its two main 
proponents, Andropov and defense minister Ustinov, and 
by reassuring signals from London and Washington, both 
worried by intelligence on Soviet paranoia. The alarmist 
RYAN reports obediently provided by KGB residencies 
were merely an extreme example of Line PR’s habitual 
tendency to tell Moscow what it wanted to hear. One 
political intelligence officer later admitted: 

In order to please our superiors, we sent in falsified 

and biased information, acting on the principle 

“Blame everything on the Americans, and everything 



will be OK.” That’s not intelligence, it’s self- 
deception!^^ 

During the first Reagan administration, as at other 
periods, the Centre would have gained a far more accurate 
insight into American policy by reading the New York 
Times or Washington Post than by relying on the reports 
of its own residencies. One of the most striking signs of 
Gorbachev’s “new thinking” on foreign policy after he 
became general secretary in 1985 was his early 
dissatisfaction with the FCD’s political reporting. In 
December 1985 Viktor Mikhailovich Chebrikov, KGB 
chairman since 1982, summoned a meeting of the KGB 
leadership to discuss a stem memorandum from 
Gorbachev “on the impermissibility of distortions of the 
factual state of affairs in messages and informational 
reports sent to the Central Committee of the CPSU and 
other mling bodies.” The meeting sycophantically agreed 
on the need to avoid sycophantic reporting and declared 
the duty of all Chekists both at home and abroad to fulfill 
“the Leninist requirement that we need only the whole 
tmth.”^^ 

Gorbachev was far more impressed initially by the 
performance of FCD’s Directorate T. Throughout the 
Cold War the KGB had greater success in collecting 
scientific and technological intelligence (S&T) than in its 
political intelligence operations against the Main 
Adversary. Infiltrating US defense contractors and 



research institutes proved far easier than penetrating the 
heart of the federal government. S&T also rarely suffered 
from the political correctness which distorted the 
reporting of Line PR in residencies and political 
intelligence assessments at the Centre. What remained at 
least partially taboo, however, was the difficulty 
experienced by Soviet state-run industry in making full 
use of the extraordinary S&T which it received. In 1971, 
for example, the defense and electronics industry 
ministries began a joint project to duplicate Westinghouse 
cathode-ray tubes. Two years later, because of production 
problems at the State Optical Institute, little progress had 
been made.^^ It was ideologically impossible to learn the 
lessons of failures such as this, for to do so would have 
involved a recognition of the inferiority of the Soviet 
command economy to the market economies of the West. 
FCD reports thus concentrated on the structural 
contradictions of Western capitalism while glossing over 
the far more serious economic problems of the Soviet 
Bloc.^^ 

In 1970 the New York and Washington residencies 
each ran nine Line X agents and five “trusted contacts. 

In 1973 the new position of head S&T resident for the 
United States was established in New York, with 
responsibility for coordinating Line X operations by the 
three American residencies, as well as attempts to evade 
the embargo on the export of advanced technology to the 



Soviet Union. By 1975 Directorate T had seventy-seven 
agents and forty-two trusted contacts working against 
American targets inside and outside the United States. 

Mitrokhin’s notes identify thirty-two of the S&T agents 
and trusted contacts active in the United States during the 
1970s, mostly recruited in the same decade. A further 
eight whose espionage is not dated in the notes were also 
probably active in the 1970s.^^ The companies for which 
they worked included some of the leading American 
defense contractors: among them IBM, McDonnell 
Douglas and TRW.^^ The S&T agent network also 
contained scientists with access to important 
defenserelated projects at some of the United States’ best- 
known research institutes: among them MIKE at the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and TROP in 
the Argonne National Laboratory at the University of 
Chicago. In addition to the civilian S&T agent network, 
there were also KGB agents in the armed forces who 
provided intelligence on the latest military technology: 
among them JOE, an army electronics engineer who 
provided “valuable information” on military 
communications systems,^^ and NERPA, who in 1977 
was engaged in weapons research at the US army’s 
Material Development and Readiness Command 
(DARCOM).^^ 

Though Mitrokhin’s information on the extent and 
targets of the S&T network on the territory of the Main 



Adversary is far more extensive than any previously 
available account, it is not comprehensive.^^ There is, for 
example, no mention in Mitrokhin’s notes of the 
Californian drug dealer Andrew Daulton Lee, who in 
1975-6 provided the KGB residency in Mexico City with 
the operating manual for the Rhyolite surveillance 
satellite and technical data on other satellite systems. 
Lee’s source was his friend Christopher Boyce, an 
employee of Rhyolite’s manufacturer, TRW Corporations 
in Redondo Beach. Among the TRW secrets passed on to 
the KGB was detailed information on how American spy 
satellites monitored Soviet missile tests. In 1977 Lee and 
Boyce were arrested, tried and sentenced to, respectively, 
life and forty years’ imprisonment. Both achieved 
celebrity status as the subjects of the bestselling book and 
film The Falcon and the Snowman.^^ One of the KGB 
files noted by Mitrokhin reveals that only a year after the 
arrest of Lee and Boyce the KGB recruited another, 
possibly even more important, spy in TRW with the 
codename ZENIT. While Boyce had been only a clerk 
(though with access to classified documents), ZENIT was 
a scientist.^^ 

Directorate T was proud of its achievements, 
particularly against the Main Adversary, and anxious to 
bring them to the attention of the Soviet leadership. 
Brezhnev was informed in 1972 that S&T had produced a 
saving during the past year of over a hundred million 



convertible roubles. Among the successes singled out 
for Brezhnev’s attention was intelligence on the 
construction of the American space shuttle and 
preparations for unmanned flights to Mars. This, he was 
told, would solve a number of current problems in the 
development of Soviet space technology. S&T 
intelligence on the pelletization of seeds, he was further 
assured (doubtless unrealistically), would increase the 
Soviet grain harvest by 20 to 30 per cent and shorten 
growing time.^^ In 1973 Directorate T reported that it had 
acquired over 26,000 documents and 3,700 “samples.” 
Though only a minority of this material was classified, it 
included top secret information on the Saturn rocket, the 
Apollo space missions, the Poseidon, Honest John, 
Redeye, Roland, Hydra and Viper missiles, the Boeing 
747 jumbo jet and computer technology subsequently 
plagiarized in the construction of the Minsk-32 
computer. 

The triumphs of S&T collection figured prominently in 
the Chekist Hall of Fame opened by the FCD at Yasenevo 
in 1977 to mark the sixtieth anniversary of the October 
Revolution. Directorate T’s exhibit claimed that during 
the previous fiveyear period it had obtained over 140,000 
S&T documents and more than 20,000 “samples.” These 
were alleged to have produced an economic benefit of 
over one billion roubles for the Soviet economy and to 
have advanced research work in a number of branches of 



science and technology by periods of from two to six 

97 

years. ' 

Leonid Sergeyevich Zaitsev, the dynamic and 
ambitious head of Directorate T appointed in 1975, 
argued that it should be allowed to leave the FCD and 
become an independent directorate within the KGB. It 
would, he claimed, need a budget of only 1 percent per 
annum of the value of the S&T which it supplied to 
Soviet industry and agriculture.^^ The head of the FCD, 
Kryuchkov, however, was determined not to allow such a 
prestigious part of his intelligence empire to escape from 
his control. Despite failing to win its freedom. Directorate 
T increasingly operated independently from the rest of the 
FCD. Its new recruits mostly came from scientific or 
engineering backgrounds, had their own curriculum in the 
Andropov Institute (the FCD academy) and trained 
separately from those in other departments. In foreign 
residencies Line X officers mixed relatively little with 
their colleagues in other lines. 

The Military — Industrial Commission (VPK), which 
was mainly responsible for overseeing Directorate T, 
showed greater interest in non-American targets than 
during the early Cold War.^^^ The United States none the 
less remained a more important S&T target than the rest 
of the world combined. In 1980 61.5 percent of the VPK’s 
information came from American sources (some outside 
the USA), 10.5 percent from West Germany, 8 percent 



from France, 7.5 percent from Britain and 3 percent from 
Japan.^^^ In 1980 the VPK gave instructions for 3,617 
“acquisition tasks,” of which 1,085 were completed 
within a year, benefiting 3,396 Soviet research and 
development projects. Directorate T was its chief 
collection agency. 

Directorate T owed much of its success in meeting so 
many of the VPK’s requirements to its numerous 
collaborators in the Soviet scientific community, who 
numbered approximately 90 agent-recruiters, 900 agents 
and 350 trusted contacts during the mid- 1 970s. Among 
these collaborators — ^probably the largest network of 
talent- spotters in the history of S&T — were some of the 
Soviet Union’s leading scientists. All Western scientists 
— ^particularly in the United States — in fields related to 
Directorate T’s “acquisition tasks” were potential targets 
for the KGB. The first approach to a targeted scientist 
usually came from a Soviet colleague in a similar field, 
who would try to establish cooperation at a personal or 
institutional level. Directorate T would then seek to 
recruit the more naive or corrupt of the Western scientists 
approached in this way as agents or trusted contacts. 
Among the Directorate’s agent-recruiters was the director 
of the Physics and Energy Institute of the Latvian 
Academy of Sciences (codenamed VITOS), who in 1973 
recruited MIKE, a senior physicist at MIT.^^^ SATURN, 
a department head at McDonnell Douglas, was recruited 



in 1978 with similar assistance from the Lithuanian 
Academy of Sciences. 

The KGB also took an active part in the selection of 
Soviet students for academic exchange programs with the 
United States and trained many of them as talent-spotters. 
Students were told to seek places at universities and 
research institutes within easy reach of the residencies at 
New York (Brooklyn Polytechnic, MIT, Rensselaer 
Polytechnic and the universities of Columbia, Cornell, 
Harvard, New York and Princeton), Washington 
(American, Catholic, Georgetown, George Washington 
and Maryland Universities) and San Francisco (the 
University of California at Berkeley and San Francisco, 
California Institute of Technology, University of Southern 
California and Stanford). 

Directorate T’s success in penetrating American targets 
was greatly assisted by poor security in some of its target 
companies and research institutes. Appearing in 1985 
before a Senate committee investigating security among 
defense contractors, Christopher Boyce testified that he 
and colleagues at TRW “regularly partied and boozed it 
up during working hours with the ‘black vault’” housing 
the Rhyolite satellite project. Bacardi rum, he claimed, 
was kept behind the cipher machines and a cipher- 
destruction device used as a blender to mix banana 
daiquiris and Mai-Tais.^^^ Security failures in most other 
companies probably took less exotic and alcoholic forms. 



Since most major American companies operated 
abroad, they were vulnerable to penetration outside as 
well as inside the United States. In the mid-1970s 
seventeen major US companies and research institutes 
were targeted by KGB residencies in western Europe: 
among them IBM by the London, Paris, Geneva, Vienna 
and Bonn residencies; Texas Instruments by Paris; 
Monsanto by London and Brussels; Westinghouse 
Electric by Brussels; Honeywell by Rome; ITT by 
Stockholm; and the National Institutes of Health by 
Copenhagen. European residencies were assisted by a 
number of walk-ins. In 1974, for example, a Canadian 
resident of Los Angeles (later given the codename 
SPRINTER) entered the Soviet embassy in Helsinki, 
announced that he worked for an electro-optical company 
which was developing laser anti-missile systems and 
infra-red sights for firearms, tanks, ships and aircraft, and 
offered to sell its secrets. Like SPRINTER, most of the 
KGB’s S&T network in the United States appear to have 
been mercenary spies. 

SIGINT added substantially to the S&T provided by 
agents. The SIGINT stations within the Washington, New 
York and San Francisco residencies (whose operations are 
discussed in chapter 21) succeeded in intercepting the 
telephone and fax communications of the Brookhaven 
National Laboratory and a series of major companies. 
Mitrokhin’s notes, however, do not make it possible to 
assess the proportion of S&T provided by SIGINT rather 



than HUMINT. 

Since before the Second World War S&T had been 
regarded as an essential means of preventing Soviet 
military technology and weapons systems from falling 
behind the West’s. According to one report noted by 
Mitrokhin, over half the projects of the Soviet defense 
industry in 1979 were based on S&T from the West.^^^ 
Andropov claimed in 1981 that all the tasks in military 
S&T set for the KGB had been successfully completed. 
According to an official US report, based largely on 
documents supplied during the early 1980s by Vladimir 
Vetrov (codenamed FAREWELL), a French agent in 
FCD Directorate T: 

The Soviets estimate that by using documentation on 
the US F-18 fighter their aviation and radar 
industries saved some five years of development 
time and 35 million roubles (the 1980 dollar cost of 
equivalent research activity would be $55 million) in 
project manpower and other developmental costs. 

The manpower portion of these savings probably 
represents over a thousand man-years of scientific 
research effort and one of the most successful 
individual exploitations ever of Western technology. 

The documentation of the F-18 fire-control radar 
served as the technical basis for new 
lookdown/shootdown engagement radars for the 
latest generation of Soviet fighters. US methods of 



component design, fast-Fourier-transform 
algorithms, terrain mapping functions, and real-time 
resolution-enhancement techniques were cited as key 
elements incorporated into the Soviet counterpart. 

Other successful military projects made possible by S&T 
were the construction of a Soviet clone of the AWACS 
airborne radar system and the construction of the 
Blackjack Bomber modeled on the American Bl-B.^^^ 
From the late 1970s onwards increasing emphasis was 
also put on the contribution of S&T to the Soviet 
economy. Directorate T calculated that the main branches 
of civilian industry were ten years behind their Western 
counterparts. In January 1980 Andropov instructed 
Directorate T to draw up S&T collection plans designed 
to resolve current problems in Soviet agriculture, 
metallurgy, power-generation, engineering and advanced 
technology. Of the 5,456 “samples” (machinery, 
components, microcircuits, etc.) acquired by Directorate T 
during 1980, 44 percent went to defense industries, 28 
percent to civilian industry via the State Committee for 
Science and Technology (GKNT) and 28 percent to the 
KGB and other government agencies. In the same, 
possibly exceptional year, just over half the intelligence 
obtained by Directorate T came from allied intelligence 
services, chief among them the East German HVA and 
the Czechoslovak StB.^^^ 



Among the HVA’s greatest S&T successes was its 
penetration of IBM. According to the head of the HVA, 
Markus Wolf, the East German microelectronics company 
Robotron “became so heavily dependent on 
surreptitiously acquiring IBM’s technological advances 
that it was, in effect, a sort of illegal subsidiary of that 
company.”^ Though well behind the West, Robotron 
was rather better than its Soviet equivalents in exploiting 
IBM computer technology. The KGB’s name-trace 
system SOUD (“System for Operational and Institutional 
Data”) used East German computers. 

S&T collection continued to expand during the 1980s. 
At a meeting of senior FCD staff early in 1984 
Kryuchkov reported that, “In the last two years the 
quantity of material and samples handed over to civilian 
branches of industry has increased by half as much 
again.” This, he claimed, had been used “to real economic 
effect,” particularly in energy and food production. 
Kryuchkov characteristically failed to mention that the 
sclerotic nature of Soviet economic management made it 
far harder to exploit S&T in the civilian economy than in 
the imitation of Western armaments. His obsession with 
operation RYAN also left him dissatisfied with 
Directorate T’s intelligence on the weapons systems at the 
heart of Reagan’s non-existent plans for a nuclear first 
strike. “As previously,” Kryuchkov complained, “we are 
experiencing an acute shortage of secret information 
about new types of weapon and their means of delivery.” 



The FCD “work plan” for 1984 laid down as Directorate 
T’s main intelligence priorities: 

military technology measures taken by the Main 
Adversary to build up first-strike weapons: the 
quantitative increase in nuclear munitions and means 
of delivery (MX missile complexes, Trident, 
Pershing-2, cruise missiles, strategic bombers); 
replacement of one generation of nuclear missiles by 
another (Minuteman, Trident-2), the development of 
qualitatively new types of weapons (space devices 
for multiple use for military purposes, laser and 
pencil beam weapons, non-acoustic anti-submarine 
defense weapons, electronic warfare weapons, etc.). 

The second priority was “information and specimens of 
significant interest for civilian branches of the USSR’s 
economy.”^^^ 

Like other Soviet leaders, Gorbachev doubtless took it 
for granted that Soviet military technology required S&T 
from the West. He was probably more interested, 
however, in the use of S&T to invigorate the civilian 
economy. In an address to embassy staff in London on 
December 15, 1984, three months before he became 
general secretary, he singled out for praise the 
achievements of Directorate T and its Line X officers in 
foreign residencies. It was already clear that Gorbachev 
regarded the covert acquisition of Western technology 



and scientific research as an important part of economic 
perestroika. 

The dramatic improvement in East — West relations 
during the later 1980s offered new opportunities for 
Directorate T, which produced 25-40,000 S&T 
“information reports” and 12-13,000 “samples” a year. In 
1986 it estimated their value at 550 million roubles; in 
1988 and 1989 it put the figure at one billion roubles a 
year.^^^ In the later 1980s about 150 Soviet weapons 
systems were believed by Western experts to be based on 
technology system stolen from the West.^^^ 

AS WELL AS being impressed by the achievements of 
Directorate T, Gorbachev also seems to have revised his 
initially critical opinion of the political intelligence 
provided by the FCD. During the early 1980s Kryuchkov 
had repeatedly berated his subordinates for their lack of 
success in recruiting important American agents, and 
demanded “a radical improvement.” As late as February 
1985 he denounced “the low standard” of operations 
against the Main Adversary and “the lack of appreciable 
results” by KGB residencies in recruiting US citizens. 

A walk-in to the Washington embassy two months later 
came as the answer to Kryuchkov’s prayers. By the time 
Aldrich Ames offered his services to the KGB in April 
1985 he had been working for the CIA for eighteen years. 
Within two months he had betrayed twenty Western 



(mostly American) agents: among them Dmitri Polyakov, 
a GRU general who had worked for the FBI and CIA for 
over twenty years; Oleg Gordlevsky, a British agent in the 
KGB who had just been appointed resident in London; 
Adolf Tolkachev, an electronics expert who had provided 
high-grade intelligence on the Soviet avionics system; and 
at least eleven other KGB and GRU officers stationed in 
various parts of the world. A majority were shot, though 
Gordlevsky made an epic escape from Russia, with SIS 
assistance, while under KGB surveillance. Collectively, 
they had represented probably the most successful 
Western agent penetration of the Soviet Union since the 
Bolshevik Revolution. Ames’s main motive for betraying 
them was probably greed. By the time of his arrest nine 
years later, the KGB and its successor agency had paid 
him almost three million dollars (probably more than any 
other agent in Russian history) and had promised him 
another two.^^^ As Gorbachev embarked on a new course 
in policy towards the United States, he was doubtless 
impressed by the fact that the KGB had, for the first time, 
recruited a major agent within the CIA. The FCD also 
appears to have responded to Gorbachev’s demand for 
less crudely biased reporting on the Main Adversary and 
its allies. According to Leonid Vladimirovich Shebarshin, 
then one of Kryuchkov’s deputies, “the FCD no longer 
had to present its reports in a falsely positive light,” 
though many of its officers must surely have found it 
difficult to throw off the habits of a lifetime. 



In December 1987 Gorbachev took Kryuchkov with 
him on his historic visit to Washington to sign with 
President Reagan the first arms control treaty to reduce 
the nuclear arsenals of the superpowers. Never before had 
a head of the FCD accompanied a Soviet leader on a visit 
to the West. Gorbachev’s confidence in Kryuchkov — 
which he would later bitterly regret — doubtless reflected 
his high opinion of the FCD’s success both in gathering 
an unprecedented volume of S&T and in penetrating the 
CIA. During the visit to Washington Kryuchkov had 
dinner at the Maison Blanche restaurant, unnoticed by 
other diners, with the Deputy Director of Central 
Intelligence, Robert Gates (later DCI). Gates wrote later: 

Looking back, it is embarrassing to realize that, at 
this first high-level CIA — KGB meeting, Kryuchkov 
smugly knew that he had a spy — Aldrich Ames — at 
the heart of CIA, that he knew quite well what we 
were telling the President and others about the Soviet 
Union, and that he was aware of many of our human 
and technical collection efforts in the USSR.^^^ 

In October 1988 Kryuchkov achieved his ambition of 
becoming the first foreign intelligence chief to become 
chairman of the KGB. His valedictory address on leaving 
the FCD was a remarkable mixture of the old and new 
thinking. “Democratization and glasnost are the motive 
force of perestroika^ he declared, “and we shall not win 



through without them:” 

Unless we have an objective view of the world, 
seeing it unadorned and free of cliches and 
stereotyped ideas, all claims about the effectiveness 
of our foreign policy operations will be nothing but 
empty words. 

The old suspicions and conspiracy theories about the 
United States, however, still lurked not far below the 
surface of Kryuchkov’s address. Without mentioning 
operation RYAN by name, he sought to justify the 
principles on which it was based: 

Many of [the FCD’s] former responsibilities have 
not been removed from the agenda. The principal 
one of these is not to overlook the immediate danger 
of nuclear conflict being unleashed. 

And he added a warning about what he alleged was the 
continuing brutality of “provocation operations” by 
Western intelligence services; he claimed that there had 
been over 900 such operations during the first half of 
1988 alone. Kryuchkov began 1989 with a dramatic 
demonstration of the new climate of East — West 
relations, becoming the first chairman in KGB history to 
receive the United States ambassador in his office. 
Thereafter he embarked on an unprecedented public 



relations campaign designed to win over Western as well 
as Soviet opinion. “The KGB,” he declared, “should have 
an image not only in our country but worldwide which is 
consistent with the noble goals I believe we are pursuing 
in our work.”^^^ 

After a brief power struggle, Kryuchkov was succeeded 
as head of the FCD by the 5 3 -year-old Leonid Shebarshin, 
the first man with experience of working in countries 
outside the Soviet Bloc to run foreign intelligence since 
the Second World War.^^^ One of Shebarshin’s main jobs 
at the beginning of the Gorbachev era had been to prepare 
intelligence reports for the Party leadership. The fact that 
he leapfrogged several more senior candidates for his new 
post is a certain indication that his briefing had impressed 
Gorbachev. Foreign intelligence officers interviewed 
by zvestia after Shebarshin’s resignation in September 
1991 described him as “the first really competent head of 
the FCD in decades. According to Shebarshin, his 
main initial brief from Gorbachev was “to ensure the 
West did not cheat on arms control.” 

The tactical victories of the FCD against the Main 
Adversary which impressed Gorbachev failed to avert 
strategic defeat. Directorate T’s very success in stealing 
Western secrets merely underlined the structural problems 
of the Soviet economy. Despite S&T worth a billion 
roubles a year and the Soviet Union’s large numbers of 
scientists and engineers, Soviet technology fell steadily 



further and further behind the West. Gorbachev’s reforms 
served only to weaken further the command economy, 
without establishing a market economy in its stead. There 
was a bread shortage even after the good harvest of 
1990.^^^ No amount of either economic or political 
intelligence could stave off the disintegration of the 
failing Soviet system. 

As the Soviet Union’s economic problems multiplied 
during 1990 and separatist movements strengthened, the 
Centre’s traditional suspicions of the Main Adversary 
revived. Kryuchkov did not place all the blame for 
Russia’s ills on imperialist plots. “The main sources of 
our trouble, in the KGB’s view,” he declared, “are to be 
found inside the country.” But he accused the CIA and 
other Western intelligence services of promoting “anti- 
socialist” and separatist forces as part of a “secret war 
against the Soviet state. According to Shebarshin, 
Gorbachev failed to heed the FCD’s warnings. “He and 
his friends lived in a world of self-delusion ... We were 
hitching our wagon to the Western train.”^^^ With 
Gorbachev, in the Centre’s view, unwilling to offend the 
Americans, Kryuchkov began to publicize some of the 
KGB’s neglected conspiracy theories. In December 1990 
he denounced a (non-existent) Western plot, “akin to 
economic sabotage,” to “deliver impure and sometimes 
infected grain, as well as products with an above-average 
level of radioactivity or containing harmful substances.” 



™ In February 1991 first Kryuchkov’s deputy, Viktor 
Fyodorovich Grushko, and then the new prime minister, 
Valentin Pavlov, denounced an equally imaginary plot by 
Western banks to undermine the rouble. The fullest public 
version of the Centre’s theory of a vast American-led 
conspiracy to subvert the Soviet Union was set out in 
April 1991 in a speech by the head of KGB assessments, 
Nikolai Sergeyevich Leonov, formerly deputy head of the 
FCD, responsible for operations in North and South 
America. The goal of US policy, he declared, was “to 
eliminate the Soviet Union as a united state.” Gorbachev, 
he implied, was refusing to listen: 

The KGB has been informing the leadership of the 
country about this in time and detail. We would not 
want a repetition of the tragic situation before the 
Great Patriotic War against Germany, when Soviet 
intelligence warned about the imminent attack of 
Nazi Germany but Stalin rejected this information as 
wrong and even provocative. You know what this 
mistake cost us. 

Further dramatic evidence of the resurgence of the 
KGB leadership’s traditional conspiracy theories about 
the Main Adversary came in a speech by Kryuchkov to a 
closed session of the Supreme Soviet on June 17. 
Kryuchkov read out a hitherto top secret FCD report to 
the Politburo of January 1977, “On CIA Plans to Recruit 



Agents Among Soviet Citizens,” which denounced an 
imaginary CIA masterplan to sabotage the Soviet 
administration, economy and scientific research. This 
plan, Kryuchkov claimed, remained actively in force. 
The CIA’s most important agent, he solemnly informed 
Gorbachev, was his own closest adviser, Aleksandr 
Yakovlev, allegedly recruited while an exchange student 
at Columbia University over thirty years earlier. 

As Kryuchkov later complained, Gorbachev did not 
take such nonsense seriously. Nor, no doubt, did many 
FCD officers with the first-hand experience of the West 
which the KGB Chairman lacked. Kryuchkov was now 
Gorbachev’s most dangerous opponent, convinced that, 
having tamely accepted the collapse of the Soviet Bloc in 
1989, Gorbachev was now presiding over the 
disintegration of the Soviet Union. In August 1991 he 
became the chief organizer of the coup which attempted 
to topple Gorbachev and preserve the Union. 



FOURTEEN 


POLITICAL WARFARE 


Active Measures and the Main Adversary 


The philosophers,” wrote Marx, “have only interpreted 
the world in various ways; the point, however, is to 
change it.”^ In addition to collecting intelligence and 
producing politically correct assessments of it, the KGB 
also sought to influence the course of world events by a 
variety of “active measures” (aktivinyye meropriatia) 
ranging from media manipulation to “special actions” 
involving various degrees of violence. Inspired by 
exaggerated accounts of its heroic defeat of counter- 
revolutionary conspiracies between the wars and a desire 
to impress the political leadership, it frequently 
overestimated its own effectiveness. 

Throughout the Cold War the United States was the 
main target for KGB active measures as well as for 



intelligence collection. Most were at the non-violent end 
of the active measures spectrum — “influence operations” 
designed to discredit the Main Adversary. A conference 
of senior FCD officers in January 1984 reaffirmed a 
priority which had remained unchanged since the end of 
the Second World War: “Our chief task is to help to 
frustrate the aggressive intentions of American 
imperialism ... We must work unweariedly at exposing 
the adversary’s weak and vulnerable points.”^ Much of 
what was euphemistically described as “exposure” was in 
reality disinformation fabricated by Service A, the active 
measures branch of the FCD, and spread by Line PR 
officers in foreign residencies. Line PR officers were 
supposed to spend about 25 percent of their time on active 
measures, though in practice some failed to do so. 

The wide variation in the sophistication of the 
disinformation generated by Service A reflected the 
uneven quality of its personnel. About 50 per cent of its 
officers were specialists in active measures. Some of the 
remaining 50 per cent were rejects from other 
departments. Few of the ablest and most ambitious FCD 
recruits wanted jobs in Service A; it rarely offered the 
opportunity of overseas postings and was widely regarded 
as a career dead end.^ There were, of course, exceptions. 
Yuri Modin, the last controller of the Magnificent Five, 
became an active measures specialist, was appointed 
deputy head of Service A and subsequently had a 
successful Line PR posting spreading disinformation in 



India before becoming head of political intelligence at the 
Andropov Institute.^ Many Service A officers, however, 
had little, if any, experience of living in the West and 
relied on crude conspiracy theories about the capitalist 
and Zionist plotters who supposedly operated a secret 
“command center” in the United States.^ Successive 
chairmen of the KGB and heads of the FCD, none of 
whom until the late 1980s had worked in foreign 
residencies, were influenced by the same theories. 

IT WOULD HAVE been wholly out of character had the 
Centre failed to interpret President Kennedy’s 
assassination by Lee Harvey Oswald in Dallas on 
November 22, 1963 as anything less than conspiracy. The 
deputy chairman of the KGB reported to the Central 
Committee in December: 

A reliable source of the Polish friends [the Polish 
intelligence service], an American entrepreneur and 
owner of a number of firms closely connected to the 
petroleum circles of the South, reported in late 
November that the real instigators of this criminal 
deed were three leading oil magnates from the South 
of the USA — Richardson, Murchison and Hunt, all 
owners of major petroleum reserves in the southern 
states who have long been connected to pro-fascist 
and racist organizations in the South.^ 



It was not difficult to find circumstantial “evidence” for 
this simplistic conspiracy theory, particularly as regards 
the oil magnate and anti-Communist buffoon H. L. Hunt. 
“The Communists need not invade the United States,” 
Hunt once preposterously declared. “Pro-Bolshevik 
sentiment in the US is already greater than when the 
Bolsheviks overthrew the Kerensky government and took 
over Russia.”^ 

Hunt’s son. Bunker, was one of a group of right-wing 
mavericks who had paid for a full-page advertisement in 
the Dallas Morning News on the day of Kennedy’s visit, 
accusing the President of being a Communist stooge — a 
charge which prompted Kennedy to say he was “heading 
into nut country.”^ The Dallas strip-club owner Jack 
Ruby, who shot and fatally wounded Oswald on 
November 24, had visited the Hunt offices shortly before 
Kennedy’s assassination.^ 

The KGB reported that a journalist from the Baltimore 
Sun “said in a private conversation in early December that 
on assignment from a group of Texas financiers and 
industrialists headed by millionaire Hunt, Jack Ruby, who 
is now under arrest, proposed a large sum of money to 
Oswald for the murder of Kennedy.” Oswald had 
subsequently been shot by Ruby to prevent him revealing 
the plot.^^ Khrushchev seems to have been convinced by 
the KGB view that the aim of the right-wing conspirators 
behind Kennedy’s assassination was to intensify the Cold 



War and “strengthen the reactionary and aggressive 
elements of American foreign policy.”^ ^ 

The choice of Oswald as Kennedy’s assassin, the KGB 
believed, was intended to divert public attention from the 
racist oil magnates and make the assassination appear to 
be a Communist plot.^^ The Centre had strong reasons of 
its own to wish to deflect responsibility for the 
assassination from Oswald. It was deeply embarrassed by 
the fact that in 1959 Oswald had defected to Russia, 
professing disgust with the American way of life and 
admiration for the Soviet system. Initially the KGB had 
suspected that he might have been sent on a secret 
mission by the CIA, but eventually concluded that he was 
an unstable nuisance and were glad to see the back of him 
when he returned to Texas with his Russian wife in 1962. 
After Oswald’s return the FBI at first similarly suspected 
that he might be a Soviet agent but then seems to have 
made the same jaundiced assessment of him as the 
Centre. KGB suspicions of Oswald revived, however, 
when he wrote to the CPUS A in August 1963 asking 
whether it might be better for him to continue the fight 
against “anti-progressive forces” as a member of the 
“underground” rather than as an open supporter of 
“Communist ideals.” Jack Childs (codenamed MARAT), 
an undeclared member of the CPUS A who acted as one of 
its main points of contact with the KGB, warned Moscow 
that Oswald’s letter “was viewed as an FBI provocation.” 



The fact that, unknown to the KGB, Childs was himself 
an FBI agent renders his warning unusually ironic. 

The Warren Commission, appointed by President 
Lyndon B. Johnson to investigate Kennedy’s 
assassination, reported in September 1964 that it had 
found “very persuasive” evidence that Oswald had acted 
alone and none of a conspiracy. Though the report was 
flawed, its main conclusions are probably accurate. 
Service A, which may well have been genuinely 
persuaded that Kennedy was the victim of a right-wing 
conspiracy, succeeded in sponsoring its first counterblast 
even before the Warren Report appeared. The publisher 
was Carl Aldo Marzani (codenamed NORD), an Italian- 
born American Communist and Soviet agent, probably 
recruited before the Second World War, who was 
extensively used by the KGB for active measures. Early 
in 1960 the New York residency recommended to the 
Centre that Marzani be given 6-7,000 dollars to enable his 
Liberty Book Club to continue publishing pro- Soviet 
material: 

NORD is an extremely energetic person and is quite 
devoted to his task. Despite his financial difficulties, 
he is struggling to keep SEVER [North, the Liberty 
Book Club publishing company] afloat. SEVER, 
together with its commercial bookselling network, 
the Prometheus Book Club, has been in existence for 
fourteen years. During this time it has published and 



distributed more than 200 titles of a progressive 
nature, by both American and foreign authors. The 
catalogue of the SEVER publishing firm lists around 
fifty titles, and the Prometheus Book Club has 7,000 
members. Books are also sent to 8,000 addresses on 
an individual basis. 

The international department of the Central Committee 
was plainly impressed. In May 1960 it approved a secret 
grant of 15,000 dollars, more than twice the sum 
suggested by the New York residency. 

Marzani’s productions during 1960 included his own 
translation of a rapturous endorsement of the Soviet 
system by an Italian Communist: 

It is the duty of every Socialist, of every democrat, of 
every modem man, to deepen his understanding of 
the USSR ... We are today capable of continuing to 
transform the world, thanks to the successes of the 
USSR, thanks to the successes in a series of other 
countries, thanks to the stmggles which we all wage 
in our own lands. We can, and we will, extend the 
civilization that was bom in October 1917.^^ 

In September 1961 the CPSU Central Committee 
allocated another 55,000 dollars for the next two years to 
allow Marzani to expand his publications. He was given a 
further 10,000 dollars a year to cover advertising costs. 



When the young KGB officer Oleg Kalugin, stationed in 
New York in the early 1960s under cover as a Radio 
Moscow reporter, paid his first visit to one of Marzani’s 
receptions, he found his apartment “filled with a motley 
assortment of Communists, liberals, and KGB spooks — 
all of them watched, undoubtedly, by FBI informers in 
attendance. 

Among the books published by Marzani in 1964 was 
the first volume on the Kennedy assassination to appear in 
the United States, Oswald: Assassin or Fall-Guy? by the 
German writer Joachim Joesten. At the beginning of the 
book Joesten expresses his “heartfelt thanks ... to Carl 
Marzani, a shrewd and hard-hitting publisher in the finest 
American tradition, who put his whole heart and soul in 
this book;” Marzani succeeded in publishing it within five 
weeks of receiving the manuscript. Joesten supported 
Moscow’s line in pinning the blame for the assassination 
on a conspiracy by right-wing racists, chief among them 
“oil magnate H. L. Hunt:” 

They all feared that Mr. Kennedy, with his test-ban 
treaty, his neutralization of Laos, his dislike of Latin- 
American militarists, and his quiet feelers towards 
Castro, intended to put an end to the Cold War, cut 
back the arms budget and bring under control the 
Warfare State — that “military-industrial complex” 
which President Eisenhower had excoriated, and 
warned the nation about, in his farewell address. 



According to Joesten, Oswald was “an FBI agent 
provocateur with a CIA background” who had been 
judged expendable, used as a fall guy and murdered to 
prevent him giving evidence.^^ Oswald: Assassin or Fall- 
Guy? thus established two themes which were to recur in 
Soviet and Russian active measures for the next thirty 
years: a plot by Hunt and other right-wing fanatics; and 
the involvement of the CIA. At the time, however, 
Joesten ’s book was overshadowed by the publication of 
the Warren report and further undermined by the publicity 
given to Joesten’ s Communist background.^^ 

The KGB correctly identified the New York lawyer 
Mark Lane as the most talented of the first wave of 
conspiracy theorists researching the JFK assassination. 
According to one report made on him, probably by the 
New York residency: 

Mark Lane is well known as a person with close ties 
to Democratic Party circles in the US. He holds 
liberal views on a number of current American 
political problems and has undertaken to conduct his 
own private investigation of the circumstances 
surrounding the murder of J. Kennedy.^^ 

Joesten praised Lane as “brilliant and courageous” and 
dedicated his own book to him: “Neither the ‘police state 
tactics’ of the FBI — to use [Lane’s] own words — nor the 



conspiracy of silence of the press magnates, could sway 
him from doggedly pursuing the truth. Together with 
student assistants and other volunteers, Lane founded the 
Citizens’ Committee of Inquiry in a small office on lower 
Fifth Avenue and rented a small theater at which, each 
evening for several months, he gave what became known 
as “The Speech,” updating the development of his 
conspiracy theory. “This alternative method of dissent 
was required,” writes Lane, “because not a single network 
radio or television program permitted the broadcast of a 
word of divergence from the official view.”^^ Though it 
dared not take the risk of contacting Lane directly, the 
New York residency sent him 1,500 dollars to help 
finance his research through the intermediary of a close 
friend whom Lane’s KGB file identifies only as a trusted 
contact. While Lane was not told the source of the money, 
the residency suspected that he might have guessed where 
it came from; it was also concerned that the secret subsidy 
might be discovered by the 

The same intermediary provided 500 dollars to pay for 
a trip by Lane to Europe in 1964. While there. Lane asked 
to visit Moscow in order to discuss some of the material 
he had found. The Centre regretfully concluded that 
inviting him to Russia would reveal its hand in too blatant 
a way and his proposed trip was “tactfully postponed.” 
Trusted contacts were, however, selected from among 
Soviet journalists to encourage him in his research. 



Among them was the KGB agent Genrikh Borovik, who 
later maintained regular contact with Lane. Lane’s Rush 
to Judgment, published in 1966, alleged complicity at the 
highest levels of government in the Kennedy 
assassination. It was top of that year’s hardback 
bestseller list and went on to become the bestselling 
paperback of 1967, as well as enjoying what Lane 
modestly describes as “enormous success around the 
world” and causing “a dramatic change in public 
perception” of the assassination.^^ 

During the late 1960s and early 1970s, Lane’s success 
was less enormous. The most popular books on the 
assassination were now those that exposed some of the 
excesses of the conspiracy theorists.^ ^ CPUSA leaders 
who visited Moscow in 1971, though describing Rush to 
Judgment as “advantageous to the Communists,” claimed 
that Lane’s main motive was his own self- 
aggrandizement.^^ In the mid-1970s, however, the 
dramatic revelations of real conspiracy in the Nixon 
White House and of CIA assassination plots against 
several foreign statesmen gave the conspiracy theorists a 
new lease on life.^^ The KGB, predictably, was anxious to 
lose no opportunity to promote active measures which 
supported the increasingly popular theory that the CIA 
was behind Kennedy’s assassination. Its chief target was 
the former CIA officer turned Watergate conspirator E. 
Howard Hunt (sometimes confused with the Texan oil 



millionaire H. L. Hunt), who had been wrongly accused 
of being in Dallas on the day of the assassination. 

The centerpiece of the active measure against Howard 
Hunt, codenamed ARLINGTON, was a forged letter to 
him from Oswald, allegedly written a fortnight before the 
assassination. The letter used phrases and expressions 
taken from actual letters written by Oswald during his two 
years in the Soviet Union, was fabricated in a clever 
imitation of his handwriting. 

Dear Mr. Hunt, 

I would like information concerning my position. 

I am only asking for information. I am suggesting 
that we discuss the matter fully before any steps are 
taken by me or anyone else. 

Thank-you. 

Lee Harvey Oswald^^ 

The implication, clearly, was that Oswald wanted to meet 
Hunt before going ahead with the assassination. 

Before being used, the forgery was twice checked for 
“authenticity” by the Third Department of the KGB’s 
OTU (operational technical) Directorate. In 1975 
photocopies of it were sent to three of the most active 
conspiracy buffs, together with covering letters from an 
anonymous wellwisher who claimed that he had given the 
original to the Director of the FBI, Clarence Kelly, who 
appeared to be suppressing it. The Centre was doubtless 



disappointed that for almost two years its forgery received 
no publicity. In 1977, however, the letter was published 
by Penn Jones, the retired owner of a small Texas 
newspaper and self-published author of four books about 
the assassination. The New York Times reported that three 
handwriting experts had authenticated the letter. Oswald’s 
widow also identified her husband’s handwriting. 
Experts summoned by the House Select Committee on 
Assassinations in 1978 concluded more prudently that 
they were unable to reach a “firm conclusion” because of 
the absence of the original document.^^ 

The Centre was somewhat put out, however, by the fact 
that initial press reaction to its forgery centered chiefly on 
the likelihood of the letter being addressed to the late 
Texan oil millionaire H. L. Hunt (the central character in 
its own original conspiracy theory), rather than the KGB’s 
current intended target, the Watergate conspirator Howard 
Hunt. Service A believed there had been a CIA plot to 
disrupt its own plot. The KGB reported that an 
“orchestrated” American press campaign was seeking to 
divert public attention from Oswald’s connections with 
the American intelligence community by concentrating on 
H. L. Hunt instead. In April 1977, soon after the 
publication of the forged letter, the KGB informed the 
Central Committee that it was launching additional active 
measures to expose the supposed role of the “American 
special services” in the Kennedy assassination.^^ By 1980 



Howard Hunt was complaining that, “It’s become an 
article of faith that I had some role in the Kennedy 
assassination. 

By the late 1970s the KGB could fairly claim that far 
more Americans believed some version of its own 
conspiracy theory of the Kennedy assassination, involving 
a right-wing plot and the US intelligence community, than 
still accepted the main findings of the Warren 
Commission. Soviet active measures, however, had done 
less to influence American opinion than the Centre 
believed. By their initial cover-ups the CIA and the FBI 
had unwittingly probably done more than the KGB to 
encourage the sometimes obsessional conspiracy theorists 
who swarmed around the complex and confusing 
evidence on the assassination. Allen Dulles, the recently 
retired DCI on the Warren Commission, had deliberately 
not informed the commission that the CIA had plotted the 
assassination of Castro. On the very day of Kennedy’s 
assassination, the Agency had supplied an agent with a 
murder weapon for use against Castro. J. Edgar Hoover 
too had held back important information. He discovered, 
to his horror, that Oswald had not been included on the 
FBI’s security index of potentially disloyal citizens, 
despite having written a threatening letter to the Bureau 
after his return from Russia and subsequently making an 
appointment to see a KGB officer in Mexico City. After 
reading a report on “investigative deficiencies in the 
Oswald case,” Hoover concluded that, if it became public. 



the report would destroy the FBI’s reputation.^^ 

The information withheld by Dulles and Hoover would 
have been most unlikely to undermine the Warren 
Commission’s conclusion that Oswald had been a lone 
assassin. But, when it became public in the mid-1970s, it 
inevitably encouraged the belief that there had been other 
cover-ups which pointed to the involvement of the 
intelligence community. The Watergate scandal, and the 
revelations of intelligence abuses which followed, created 
a perfect breeding ground for the spread of conspiracy 
theories. Though most of the major abuses had been 
ordered or authorized by successive presidents, the belief 
grew that, in the words of Senator Frank Church, 
chairman of the Senate Select Committee to Study 
Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence 
Activities, the CIA had been “behaving like a rogue 
elephant on the rampage. 

SERVICE A SEIZED eagerly on Church’s ill-chosen 
metaphor. The KGB’s most valuable asset in its active 
measures to discredit the Agency was an embittered 
former CIA operations officer in Latin America, Philip 
Agee (codenamed PONT),^^ who had been forced to 
resign in 1968 after complaints at his heavy drinking, 
poor financial management and attempts to proposition 
wives of American diplomats. Though he remained in 
the West, Agee became, in effect, the CIA’s first defector. 



In 1973 he approached the KGB residency in Mexico City 
and offered what the head of the FCD’s Counter- 
intelligence Directorate, Oleg Kalugin, called “reams of 
information about CIA operations.” The suspicious KGB 
resident, however, found Agee’s offer too good to be true, 
concluded that he was part of a CIA plot and turned him 
away. According to Kalugin: 

Agee then went to the Cubans, who welcomed him 
with open arms ... The Cubans shared Agee’s 
information with us. But as I sat in my office in 
Moscow reading reports about the growing list of 
revelations coming from Agee, I cursed our officers 
for turning away such a prize.^^ 

In January 1975 Agee published an uncompromisingly 
hostile memoir of his career in the CIA entitled Inside the 
Company: CIA Diary, which identified approximately 
250 Agency officers and agents and claimed that 
“millions of people all over the world had been killed or 
had their lives destroyed by the CIA and the institutions it 
supports. The self-congratulatory KGB file on the 
book claims, doubtless with some exaggeration, that it 
was “prepared by Service A, together with the Cubans. 
Mitrokhin’s notes do not indicate exactly what the KGB 
and its Cuban ally, the DGI, contributed to Agee’s text. 
As Agee himself acknowledged, however: 
“Representatives of the Communist Party of Cuba [the 



DGI] ... gave important encouragement at a time when I 
doubted that I would be able to find the additional 
information I needed. While Agee was writing his 
book in Britain, the KGB maintained contact with him 
through its co-optee, Edgar Anatolyevich Cheporov, 
London correspondent of the Novosti news agency and 
the Literaturnaya Gazeta.^^ At Service A’s insistence, 
Agee removed all references to CIA penetration of Latin 
American Communist parties from his typescript before 
publication.^^ 

Because of legal problems in the United States, Inside 
the Company was first published in Britain, where it was 
an instant bestseller. The London Evening News called it 
“a frightening picture of corruption, pressure, 
assassination and conspiracy.” The Economist 
commended it as “inescapable reading.” Probably most 
valuable of all, from Service A’s viewpoint, was a review 
in the Spectator by Miles Copeland, a former CIA station 
chief in Cairo, who described Inside the Company as “as 
complete an account of spy work as is likely to be 
published anywhere.” With enthusiastic support from a 
number of journalists, Agee then set about unmasking the 
members of the CIA London station, some of whom were 
surprised emerging from their homes by press 
photographers. An American theater director staged a 
production satirizing the Agency in front of a number of 
CIA officers’ houses. “For a while,” claimed Agee, “the 



CIA in Britain was a laughing stock.” The left-wing 
Labor MP Stan Newens promoted a Commons bill, 
signed by thirty-two of his colleagues, calling for the CIA 
station to be expelled. Encouraged by Agee’s success in 
Britain, there was a rush by the media in other parts of 
Europe to expose the CIA stations in their own capitals. 

The six-month delay between the publication of the 

British and American editions of Inside the Company, and 

the associated legal difficulties, merely served to increase 

media interest in the United States and ensure its place 

high on the bestseller list. A review of Inside the 

Company in the CIA’s classified in-house journal. Studies 

in Intelligence, acknowledged that it was “a severe body 

blow” to the Agency: “A considerable number of CIA 

personnel must be diverted from their normal duties to 

undertake the meticulous and time-consuming task of 

repairing the damage done to its Latin- American program 
’’51 

On November 16, 1976 a deportation order served on 
Agee requiring him to leave England turned his case, 
much to the delight of the Centre, into a cause celebre. 
According to one of the files noted by Mitrokhin: 

The KGB employed firm and purposeful measures to 
force the Home Office to cancel their decision ... The 
London residency was used to direct action by a 
number of members of the Labor Party Executive, 
union leaders, leading parliamentarians, leaders of 



the National Union of Journalists to take a stand 
against the Home Office decision. 

On November 30 the first in a series of well-publicized 
meetings to protest against the deportation order was held 
in London, with speakers including Judith Hart, former 
Labor Minister of Overseas Development, the leading 
Labor left-winger Ian Mikardo, Alan Sapper of the film 
and TV technicians union and the distinguished historian 
E. P. Thompson. An active defense committee^^ based at 
the National Council of Civil Liberties organized 
petitions, rallies and pickets of the Home Office. In the 
Commons Stan Newens sponsored a protest supported by 
over fifty MPs and led a delegation to see the Home 
Secretary, Merlyn Rees. Agee addressed sympathetic 
meetings in Birmingham, Blackpool, Brighton, Bristol, 
Cambridge, Cardiff, Coventry, London, Manchester and 
Newcastle. At his appeal against deportation in January 
and February 1977, Agee’s character witnesses included 
Stan Newens, Judith Hart, former Home Office minister 
Alex Lyon, former US Attorney- General Ramsey Clark, 
Kissinger’s former aide Morton Halperin and Sean 
MacBride, Nobel Peace Prize winner and UN High 
Commissioner for Namibia. Hart and another ex-Labor 
minister, Barbara Castle, sponsored a motion, supported 
by 150 MPs, to reform the appeals procedure. According 
to Agee’s KGB file, “Campaigns of support for PONT 
were initiated in France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Holland, 



Finland, Norway, Mexico and Venezuela.” After Agee’s 
appeals had failed, the final act in the long drawn-out 
protest campaign was a Commons debate on May 3. The 
Guardian, which supported Agee’s appeal, commented: 

When Merlyn Rees ... decided that Philip Agee and 
[American journalist] Mark Hosenball must go, he 
must equally have known there would be a fuss. But 
did he realize the endlessly stretching, deeply 
embarrassing nature of that fuss — the evidence at a 
length to rival War and Peace, the press conferences, 
the parade of fervent witnesses?^^ 

Though Agee was eventually forced to leave England 
for Holland on June 3, 1977, the KGB was jubilant at the 
“deeply embarrassing nature of [the] fuss” his deportation 
had caused. The London residency’s claim that it had 
been able to “direct” the campaign by prominent Labor 
politicians and others in support of Agee was, however, 
greatly exaggerated.^^ It doubtless did not occur to the 
vast majority of Agee’s supporters to suspect the 
involvement of the KGB and the DGI.^^ 

After Agee’s well-publicized expulsion from Britain, 
the KGB continued to use him and some of his supporters 
in active measures against the CIA.^^ Among the 
documents received by Agee from what he described as 
“an anonymous sender” was an authentic copy of a 
classified State Department circular, signed by Kissinger, 



which contained the CIA’s “key intelligence questions” 
for fiscal year 1975 on economic, financial and 
commercial reporting. KGB files identify the source of 
the document as Service In the summer of 1977 the 
circular was published in a pamphlet entitled “What 
Uncle Sam Wants to Know about You,” with an 
introduction by Agee. While acknowledging that it was 
“not the most gripping document in the world,” Agee 
claimed that it demonstrated the unfair assistance secretly 
given to US companies abroad by the American 
intelligence community. 

In 1978 Agee and a small group of supporters began 
publishing the Covert Action Information Bulletin in order 
to promote what Agee called “a worldwide campaign to 
destabilize the CIA through exposure of its operations and 
personnel. Files noted by Mitrokhin claim that the 
Bulletin was founded “on the initiative of the KGB” and 
that the group running it (collectively codenamed 
RUPOR), which held its first meeting in Jamaica early in 
1978, was “put together” by FCD Directorate K 
(counterintelligence). The Bulletin was edited in 
Washington by Bill Schaap, a radical lawyer codenamed 
RUBY by the KGB, his wife, the journalist Ellen Ray, 
and another journalist, Louis Wolf, codenamed 
ARSENIO. Agee and two other disaffected former 
members of the CIA, Jim and Elsie Wilcott (previously 
employed by the Agency as, respectively, finance officer 



and secretary), contributed articles and information.^^ 
There is no evidence in Mitrokhin’s notes that any 
member of the RUPOR group, apart from Agee, was 
conscious of the role of the DGI or KGB. 

The first issue of the Covert Action Information 
Bulletin was launched by Agee and the RUPOR group at 
a Cuban press conference on the eve of the Eleventh 
World Festival of Youth and Students, held to coincide 
with the Havana carnival in the summer of 1978. Agee 
also produced advance copies of another book. Dirty 
Work: The CIA in Western Europe, coauthored by himself 
and Wolf, which contained the names and biographical 
details of 700 CIA personnel who were, or had been, 
stationed in western Europe. “Press reaction,” wrote 
Agee, “was not disappointing. In the next few days we 
learned by telephone from friends in the States and 
elsewhere that most of the major publications carried 
stories about the Bulletin and Dirty Work. Perfect. 

The Centre assembled a task force of personnel from 
Service A and Directorate K, headed by V. N. Kosterin, 
assistant to the chief of Service A, to keep the Covert 
Action Information Bulletin supplied with material 
designed to compromise the CIA. Among the material 
which the task force supplied for publication in 1979 was 
an eighteen-page CIA document entitled “Director of 
Central Intelligence: Perspectives for Intelligence, 1976- 
1981.” The document had originally been delivered 
anonymously to the apartment of the Washington 



resident, Dmitri Ivanovich Yakushkin, and at the time had 
been wrongly assessed by both the residency and the 
Centre as a “dangle” by US intelligence.^^ Agee’s 
commentary on the document highlighted the complaint 
by DCI William Colby that recent revelations of its 
operations were among the most serious problems the 
CIA had to face.^^ Kosterin’s task force, however, 
became increasingly concerned about the difficulty of 
finding enough secret material for the Bulletin, and 
recommended that it look harder for open-source material, 
ranging from readers’ letters to crises around the world 
which could be blamed on the CIA — among them the 
Jonestown massacre in Guyana, when 900 members of 
the American religious cult the “People’s Temple” had 
been persuaded to commit mass suicide or had been 
murdered. 

Following what Service A believed was the success of 
Dirty Work: The CIA in Western Europe, Agee began 
work with Wolf on a sequel. Dirty Work II: The CIA in 
Africa. Early in 1979 Oleg Maksimovich Nechiporenko of 
Directorate K and A. N. Itskov of Service A met Agee in 
Cuba and gave him a list of CIA officers working on the 
African continent. Shortly before Dirty Work II was 
finished, Agee decided not to be publicly identified as one 
of the authors for fear that he might lose his residence 
permit in Germany, where he now lived. He also changed 
his official role on the Covert Action Information Bulletin 



from editor to “editorial adviser.” “How that would save 
my residence in Germany,” Agee later acknowledged, 
“was a little obscure ... but such was my fear that I was 
barely rational — at least on this point.”^^ Nechiporenko 
and Itskov agreed with Pedro Pupo Perez, the head of the 
DGI, that publication of Dirty Work II should be timed to 
coincide with the conference of ninety-two heads of non- 
aligned nations to be held in Havana, presided over by 
Fidel Castro, in September 1979.^^ 

By Agee’s own count. Dirty Work II brought the total 
number of CIA officials exposed by him and the RUPOR 
team to about 2,000. For the KGB it had been a 
remarkably effective active measure. The Senate 
Intelligence Committee reported in 1980: 

In recent years members of the House and Senate 
Intelligence Committees ... have become 
increasingly concerned about the systematic effort by 
a small group of Americans ... to disclose the names 
of covert intelligence agents ... Foremost among 
them has been Philip Agee ... The destructive effect 
of these disclosures has been varied and wide- 
ranging ... 

The professional effectiveness of officers who 
have been compromised is substantially and 
sometimes irreparably damaged. They must reduce 
or break contact with sensitive covert sources and 
continued contact must be coupled with increased 



defensive measures that are inevitably more costly 
and time-consuming. Some officers must be 
removed from their assignments and returned from 
overseas at substantial cost, and years of 
irreplaceable area experience and language skills are 
lost. 

Since the ability to reassign the compromised 
officer is impaired, the pool of experienced CIA 
officers who can serve abroad is being reduced. 
Replacement of officers thus compromised is 
difficult and, in some cases, impossible. Such 
disclosures also sensitize hostile security services to 
CIA presence and influence foreign populations, 
making operations more difficult. 

All thirteen members of the House Intelligence 
Committee sponsored the Intelligence Identities 
Protection Bill, popularly known as the “Anti- Agee Bill,” 
which eventually became law in June 1982. Agee himself 
had been deprived of his American passport in 1981 and 
traveled over the next few years on passports issued by, 
successively, Maurice Bishop’s Marxist-Leninist regime 
in Grenada and the Sandinista government in Nicaragua. 
His influence, by now, was in sharp decline. As he 
complained, “My 1983 call for a continent-wide action 
front against the CIA’s people in Latin America went 
nowhere. People had other preoccupations and 
priorities.”^ ^ 



LIKE THE CIA, the FBI was inevitably a major target of 
KGB active measures. Until the death of J. Edgar Hoover 
in 1972, many of these measures were personally directed 
against the Bureau’s long-serving, aging and irascible 
director. Service A employed three simple and sometimes 
crude techniques. The first was to portray Hoover as in 
league with extremists such as the ultra right-wing John 
Birch Society, whose founder regarded even the former 
Republican president Dwight D. Eisenhower as “a 
dedicated conscious agent of the Communist conspiracy.” 
Service A had acquired both some of the society’s 
stationery and samples of its leaders’ signatures from its 
California headquarters to assist it in its forgeries. In 
November 1965 it fabricated a letter of good wishes from 
Hoover to the leader of the John Birch Society, reminding 
him that the FBI funds put at his disposal would enable 
the society to open several more branches. 

A second, more sophisticated form of active measures 
concerned alleged FBI abuses of civil rights. Operation 
SPIRT was designed to demonstrate that the head of the 
Passport Office in the State Department, Frances Knight, 
was a secret FBI agent whose loyalty was to Hoover 
rather than to the Secretary of State. In 1967 Service A 
forged a letter from Ms. Knight to Hoover and arranged 
for it to be sent to the celebrated columnist Drew Pearson, 
who published it in the Washington Post on August AP 
The fabricated letter reported that a situation of “extreme 



urgency” had arisen as a result of press enquiries about an 
alleged FBI request to her for information on Professor H. 
Stuart Hughes, a Harvard critic of American policy in 
Vietnam: 

I am seriously afraid that this may indicate 
preparations for a sustained press campaign against 
us. We have already discussed the attitude of the 
Secretary of State towards the long-established 
practice of the department making inquiries at the 
request of the FBI ... 

Forgive me if I sound alarmist, but I am quite 
certain from what I have heard that a principle of 
vital importance is at stake which affects the whole 
conduct of the government and, in particular, the 
effectiveness of the Bureau. 

Ms. Knight told Hoover she was unwilling to commit too 
much to paper and suggested an urgent meeting with 
him.^^ Knight and Hoover both dismissed the letter as a 
forgery, but the fact that neither denied the FBI’s contacts 
with the Passport Office persuaded the KGB that at least 
some of its mud had stuck. 

A third line of attack deployed by Service A against 
Hoover was to accuse him of being a homosexual. The 
truth about Hoover’s probably severely repressed 
sexuality is unlikely ever to be known. Later, much- 
publicized claims that he was a gay cross-dresser whose 



wardrobe included a red dress and boa, which made him 
look like “an old flapper,” and a black dress, “very fluffy, 
with flounces, and lace stockings,” which he wore with a 
black curly wig, rest on little more than the discredited 
testimony of a convicted perjurer, Susan Rosenstiel, who 
claimed to have seen Hoover so attired. Nor is there any 
reliable evidence that Hoover and his deputy, Clyde 
Tolson, who shared his house, ever had a homosexual 
relationship. But attempts to portray him as a heterosexual 
are also less than convincing. Hoover had no known 
female liaisons. As his staunchly loyal number three, 
“Deke” DeLoach, acknowledges, probably the only 
person he had ever loved was his mother: “Hoover’s 
capacity to feel deeply for other human beings [was] 
interred with her in the Old Congressional Cemetery near 
Seward Square. 

The later commercial success, admittedly in a more 
prurient period, of fanciful stories of Hoover at gay 
transvestite parties suggests that in fabricating stories of 
his homosexual affairs in the late 1960s Service A had hit 
upon a potentially promising active measures theme. 
DeLoach was later depressed to discover how readily 
such stories were accepted as “undeniable truth:” 

“Tell us about Hoover and Tolson,” people would 

say. 

“Was it obvious?” 

“Did everyone know what was going on?”^^ 



As sometimes happened, however, Service A spoiled a 
plausible falsehood by surrounding it with improbable 
amounts of conspiracy theory. It sent anonymous letters, 
intended to appear to come from the Ku Klux Klan, to the 
editors of leading newspapers, accusing Hoover of 
personally selecting for promotion in the FBI 
homosexuals from whom he expected sexual favors. Not 
content with turning the FBI into “a den of faggots,” 
Hoover had also allegedly been engaged for several 
decades in a larger gay conspiracy to staff the CIA and the 
State Department with homosexuals. The national security 
of the United States, claimed the letters, was now 
seriously at risk.^^ Service A’s belief that major 
newspapers would take seriously nonsense of this kind, 
especially emanating from the Ku Klux Klan, was graphic 
evidence of the limitations in its understanding of 
American society. The letters had, predictably, no 
observable effect. 

THE MOST CELEBRATED victim of the FBI’s own 
active measures was the great civil rights leader Martin 
Luther King. Hoover’s obsessive belief that King was “a 
tom cat with degenerate sexual urges” and his simmering 
resentment at King’s criticism of the FBI led him to make 
the preposterous allegation to a group of journalists in 
1964 that “King is the most notorious liar in the country.” 
When his staff urged him to insist that his outburst was 



off the record, Hoover refused. “Feel free,” he told the 
journalists, “to print my remarks as given.” The active 
measures against King were organized, apparently 
without Hoover’s knowledge, by FBI Assistant Director 
William C. Sullivan. In December 1964 Sullivan sent 
King a tape recording of some of his adulterous sexual 
liaisons which the Bureau had obtained by bugging his 
room in Washington’s Willard Hotel. With the tape was 
an anonymous letter which purported to come from a 
disillusioned former supporter: 

King, look into your heart. You know you are a 
complete fraud and a great liability to all of us 
Negroes ... You could have been our greatest leader. 
You, even at an early age, have turned out to be a 
dissolute, abnormal moral imbecile ... You are 
finished. You will find on the record for all time ... 
your hideous abnormalities ... What incredible 
evilness. It is all there on the record. 

King was probably the only prominent American to be 
the target of active measures by both the FBI and the 
KGB. By the mid-1960s the claims by the CPUSA 
leadership that secret Party members within King’s 
entourage would be able to “guide” his policies had 
proved to be hollow. To the Centre’s dismay. King 
repeatedly linked the aims of the civil rights movement 
not to the alleged worldwide struggle against American 



imperialism but to the fulfillment of the American dream 
and “the magnificent words of the Constitution and the 
Declaration of Independence.” He wrote in his 
inspirational “Letter from Birmingham Jail” in 1963: 

I have no despair about the future ... We will reach 
the goal of freedom in Birmingham [Alabama] and 
all over the nation, because the goal of America is 
freedom ... We will win our freedom because the 
sacred heritage of our nation and the eternal will of 
God are embodied in our echoing demands. 

Having given up hope of influencing King, the Centre 
aimed instead at replacing him with a more radical and 
malleable leader. In August 1967 the Centre approved an 
operational plan by the deputy head of Service A, Yuri 
Modin, former controller of the Magnificent Five, to 
discredit King and his chief lieutenants by placing articles 
in the African press, which could then be reprinted in 
American newspapers, portraying King as an “Uncle 
Tom” who was secretly receiving government subsidies 
to tame the civil rights movement and prevent it 
threatening the Johnson administration. While leading 
freedom marches under the admiring glare of worldwide 
television. King was allegedly in close touch with the 
President. 

The same operational plan also contained a series of 
active measures designed to discredit US policy “on the 



Negro issue.” The Centre authorized Modin: 

• To organize, through the use of KGB 
residency resources in the US, the publication and 
distribution of brochures, pamphlets, leaflets and 
appeals denouncing the policy of the Johnson 
administration on the Negro question and exposing 
the brutal terrorist methods being used by the 
government to suppress the Negro rights movement. 

• To arrange, via available agent resources, for 
leading figures in the legal profession to make public 
statements discrediting the policy of the Johnson 
administration on the Negro question. 

• To forge and distribute through illegal 
channels a document showing that the John Birch 
Society, in conjunction with the Minuteman 
organization, is developing a plan for the physical 
elimination of leading figures in the Negro 
movement in the US.^^ 

Service A sought to exploit the violent images of the 
long, hot summers which began in August 1965 with race 
riots in Watts, the black Los Angeles ghetto, which 
resulted in thirty-six deaths, left 1,032 injured and caused 
damage estimated at over 40 million dollars. The Centre 
seems to have hoped that as violence intensified King 
would be swept aside by black radicals such as Stokeley 
Carmichael, who told a meeting of Third World 
revolutionaries in Cuba in the summer of 1967, “We have 
a common enemy. Our struggle is to overthrow this 



system ... We are moving into open guerrilla warfare in 
the United States.” Traveling on to North Vietnam, 
Carmichael declared in Hanoi, “We are not reformists ... 
We are revolutionaries. We want to change the American 
system.”^^ 

King’s assassination on April 4, 1968 was quickly 
followed by the violence and rioting which the KGB had 
earlier blamed King for trying to prevent. Within a week 
riots had erupted in over a hundred cities, forty-six people 
had been killed, 3,500 injured and 20,000 arrested. To 
“Deke” DeLoach, it seemed that, “The nation was 
teetering on the brink of anarchy. Henceforth, instead 
of dismissing King as an Uncle Tom, Service A portrayed 
him as a martyr of the black liberation movement and 
spread conspiracy theories alleging that his murder had 
been planned by white racists with the connivance of the 
authorities.^^ 

Simultaneously the Centre implemented a series of 
active measures designed to weaken the internal cohesion 
of the United States and undermine its international 
reputation by inciting race hatred. In 1971 Andropov 
personally approved the fabrication of pamphlets full of 
racist insults purporting to come from the extremist 
Jewish Defense League, headed by Meir Kahane, calling 
for a campaign against the “black mongrels” who, it was 
claimed, were attacking Jews and looting Jewish shops. 
Thirty pamphlets were mailed to a series of militant black 



groups in the hope of producing “mass disorders in New 
York.” At the same time forged letters were sent to sixty 
black organizations giving fictitious details of atrocities 
committed by the League against blacks and calling for 
vengeance against Kahane and his chief lieutenants. 
Probably to the Centre’s disappointment, Kahane was 
assassinated some years later, not by a black militant but 
by an Arab. 

On at least one occasion, the Centre ordered the use of 
explosives to exacerbate racial tensions in New York. On 
July 25, 1971 the head of the FCD First (North American) 
Department, Anatoli Tikhonovich Kireyev, instructed the 
New York residency to proceed with operation 
PANDORA: the planting of a delayed-action explosive 
package in “the Negro section of New York.” Kireyev’s 
preferred target was “one of the Negro colleges.” After 
the explosion the residency was ordered to make 
anonymous telephone calls to two or three black 
organizations, claiming that the explosion was the work 
of the Jewish Defense League. 

The attempt to stir up racial tensions in the United 
States remained part of Service A’s stock-in-trade for the 
remainder of the Cold War. Before the Los Angeles 
Olympics in 1984, for example. Line PR officers in the 
Washington residency mailed bogus communications 
from the Ku Klux Klan to the Olympic committees of 
African and Asian countries. Among the racial taunts 
devised by Service A for inclusion in the mailings was the 



following: 

THE OLYMPICS^FOR THE WHITES ONLY! 
African monkeys! 

A grand reception awaits you in Los Angeles! 

We are preparing for the Olympic games by shooting 
at black moving targets. 

In Los Angeles our own Olympic flames are ready to 
incinerate you. The highest award for a true 
American patriot would be the lynching of an 
African monkey. 

Blacks, Welcome to the Olympic games in Los 
Angeles! 

WeTl give you a reception you’ll never forget! 

This and other active measures on the same theme made 
front-page news in many countries. When Attorney- 
General William French Smith denounced the letters as 
KGB forgeries, Moscow predictably feigned righteous 
indignation at Washington’s anti-Soviet slanders.^^ 

THE CENTRE’S ASSESSMENT of “anti-Sovietism” in 
the United States changed radically at the beginning of the 
1970s. In 1968 the Kremlin had been so anxious to 
prevent the election of the veteran anti-Communist 
Richard Nixon that it had secretly offered to subsidize the 
campaign of his Democratic opponent, Hubert 
Humphrey.^^ Once in office, however, Nixon rapidly 



emerged as the architect of detente. More Soviet- 
American agreements were signed in 1972-3 than in the 
entire forty years since the establishment of diplomatic 
relations between Moscow and Washington. Nixon’s 
resignation in August 1974, under threat of impeachment 
for his involvement in the Watergate scandal, caused both 
dismay and deep suspicion in Moscow. Seen from the 
Kremlin, Nixon’s attempts to conceal the use of dirty 
tricks against his opponents were, as Dobrynin later 
acknowledged, “a fairly natural thing to do. Who cared if 
it was a breach of the Constitution?” The conspiracy 
theorists in the Centre convinced themselves that Nixon’s 
dramatic fall from power was due far less to public 
indignation over Watergate than to conspiracy by the 
enemies of detente — in particular the “Jewish lobby,” 
who were campaigning for unrestricted emigration by 
Soviet Jews to Israel, and the military-industrial complex, 
which was anxious to prevent lower arms expenditure.^^ 
The key figure in holding together the anti-Soviet 
coalition, in the Centre’s view, was the liberal Democrat, 
Senator Henry “Scoop” Jackson. Kissinger too regarded 
Jackson as “the indispensable link between the liberals, 
preoccupied with human rights [in the Soviet Union], and 
the conservatives, who became anxious about any 
negotiations with the Soviets.” “Jackson,” one 
commentator has written, “was not the type of leader who 
needed an impassioned aide to tell him what to think, but 
he had one anyway: Richard Perle, an intense, razor- sharp 



scourge of the Soviets who, despite his cherubic smile, 
earned the sobriquet Prince of Darkness from the legions 
he had engaged in bureaucratic battle.” Perle was the 
leader of what the KGB saw as a particularly dangerous 
part of the Jewish lobby: an informal group on Capitol 
Hill which included both paid Israeli lobbyists and 
congressional staffers. 

Jackson was propelled into battle in August 1972 by 
the Soviet announcement of an exit tax on emigrants, 
theoretically designed to repay the costs of their 
statefunded education but whose main practical effect 
would have been to reduce Jewish emigration to a trickle. 
In October Jackson introduced an amendment to the 
Nixon Trade Reform Bill barring the Soviet Union from 
receiving most-favored nation status and trade credits 
until it had lifted restrictions on emigration. Though 
Moscow quickly dropped the exit tax, Jackson maintained 
his amendment. For the next two years Kissinger 
conducted a shuttle diplomacy between Moscow and 
Jackson, trying vainly to obtain enough Soviet 
concessions on Jewish emigration to persuade Jackson to 
back down. “For a long time,” said Kissinger later, “I did 
not realize that Jackson could not be placated.”^^ 

Dobrynin reported to Moscow that Jackson “kept 
escalating his demands” in order to win the backing of the 
Jewish lobby for his attempt to win the Democratic 
nomination at the 1976 elect! on.^^ The New York 



resident, Boris Solomatin, informed the Centre that 
Jackson appeared to be in a strong position for the 
presidential primaries: 

Jackson’s strong point is the fact that, during his 
nearly thirty-five years in Congress, he has never 
been involved in any sort of political or personal 
scandal. In the post- Watergate period the personal 
integrity of a presidential candidate has had 
exceptionally great significance. It is necessary to 
find some stains on the Senator’s biography and use 
them to carry out an active measure which will 
compromise him. We must discuss with the 
American friends [the CPUS A] the most effective 
ways and means of opposing Jackson’s plans to 
become president of the USA. 

Others in the Centre cynically concluded that Jackson’s 
reticence about his private life “probably points to the 
existence of compromising information which could be 
used to discredit him and his family.” The KGB’s search 
for “compromising information” was extraordinarily 
wide-ranging. Despite the fact that Jackson’s parents had 
left Norway as long ago as 1885, the Oslo residency was 
ordered in 1974 to make a detailed investigation of his 
Norwegian relatives. As the American residencies 
examined Jackson’s long political career with a fine 
toothcomb, the most promising area which seemed to 



emerge was his sexuality. Jackson’s file in the Centre 
records that his marriage at the age of forty-nine “amazed 
many of his colleagues, who had considered him a 
confirmed bachelor.” Intensive KGB research, however, 
found no more incriminating evidence of homosexuality 
than the fact that for many years Jackson had shared an 
apartment in Washington with a male childhood friend. 

Lacking any proof that Jackson had ever been a 
practicing homosexual, the Centre decided to fabricate it 
in an active measure codenamed operation POROK. In 
1976 Service A forged an FBI memorandum, dated June 
20, 1940, in which Hoover reported to the Assistant 
Secretary of Justice that Jackson was a homosexual. 
Photocopies of the forgery were sent to the Chicago 
Tribune, the Los Angeles Times, the Topeka Capital and 
Jimmy Carter’s campaign headquarters. Service A also 
sought to exploit a number of incidents during the 1976 
primary campaign. After an argument with a gay rights 
activist at a press conference in March, Jackson told him 
that he did not want his vote. During a television 
appearance in April, Jackson declared that 
“homosexuality leads to the destruction of the family.” 
The KGB sent these statements, together with bogus 
documents purporting to show that Jackson and Perle 
were members of a gay sex club, to, among others: 
Senator Edward Kennedy, who was thought “personally 
hostile to Jackson;” the columnist Jack Anderson; and the 
magazines Playboy and Penthouse. 



Because of Jackson’s continuing influence on the 
ratification of Soviet- American arms limitation 
agreements, operation POROK continued long after he 
had failed to gain the Democratic nomination. One of the 
aims of the operation during 1977 was to incite the gay 
press into attacking Jackson as a closet gay who 
hypocritically attacked homosexuality in public for his 
own political advantage. Early in May a Service A officer 
in New York posted a forged FBI document to the 
California-based magazine Gay Times reporting that 
Jackson had been an active homosexual while working as 
a state prosecutor in the early 1940s. Handwritten on the 
forgery was the heading “Our Gay in the US Senate.” 
Like the rest of operation POROK, the forgery had no 
discernible effect on Jackson’s career. 

THE CENTRE’S MAIN target within the Carter 
administration, which took office in 1977, was the Polish- 
bom National Security Adviser, Zbigniew Brzezinski, 
previously an ill-chosen KGB target for cultivation.^^ As 
Brzezinski later acknowledged, he and Secretary of State 
Cyms Vance engaged in a “prolonged and intense” debate 
over policy to the Soviet Union. The result, according to 
Vance, was an unstable balance between the “visceral 
anti-Sovietism” of Brzezinski and his own “attempt to 
regulate dangerous competition” between the 
superpowers.^^ “When Carter spoke on foreign affairs,” 
complained Dobrynin, the Soviet ambassador, “we tended 



to hear echoes of the anti-Sovietism of Brzezinski.”^^ The 
aim of Service A was to diminish Brzezinski’s influence 
relative to Vance’s and, if possible, to engineer his 
dismissal. 

The Centre ordered its American residencies to begin a 
trawl for potentially damaging information on Brzezinski 
as wide-ranging as that which preceded operation 
POROK. Was Brzezinski concealing Jewish origins? Was 
he having an affair with the actress Candice Bergen? Was 
there any compromising material on his relations with, 
among others, his deputy David Aaron, his special 
assistant Karl Inderfurth, Ambassador Richard Gardner 
and the Polish emigre community? 

Though muckraking in the United States appears to 
have proved unproductive, the Centre was supplied with 
what it believed was sensational evidence of Brzezinski’s 
secret career in the CIA by the Bulgarian intelligence 
service. Probably under pressure from his interrogators, 
Henrich Natan Shpeter, a Bulgarian economist who had 
confessed to working for both American and Israeli 
intelligence, produced a bizarre account of a visit to 
Bulgaria in 1963 by Brzezinski, then a professor at 
Columbia University, as a guest of the Academy of 
Sciences. Shpeter allegedly claimed that Brzezinski was a 
CIA officer who contacted him by using a password, 
received intelligence from him and gave him further 
instructions for intelligence operations. In addition, even 
in 1963, according to Shpeter, Brzezinski had a major role 



in framing US policy towards the Soviet Bloc. 

Shpeter’s story, in short, was strikingly similar to those 
expected of defendants in Stalinist show trials. The 
Centre, however, was easily seduced by attractive 
conspiracy theories and used Shpeter’s bizarre tale as the 
basis of an active measure code-named operation 
MUREN. Service A drafted a bogus report on Brzezinski 
by an Israeli Zionist organization which included 
allegedly authentic details of his involvement in Shpeter’s 
espionage. The report went on to denounce Brzezinski as 
“a secret anti-Semite” and declared that the Zionists had 
compromising information on his private life which 
would seriously discredit him. 

The Centre decided to deliver this bizarre document to 
the US embassy in Israel, convinced that its contents were 
so sensational that they would be brought to carter’s as 
well as Vance’s attention. On August 20, 1978 the report 
was inserted through the half-open window of a car 
parked by an American diplomat on a street in East 
Jerusalem. In all probability, the US embassy 
dismissed the document as the work of a mildly deranged 
conspiracy theorist. Service A, however, persuaded itself 
that it had succeeded in putting Brzezinski ’s career in 
jeopardy. It seized on press articles during and after the 
negotiation of the Camp David agreement between Egypt 
and Israel in September 1978 — which appeared to show 
that Vance had established himself as Carter’s main 
foreign policy adviser — as proof that Brzezinski had been 



demoted. In November 1978 the deputy head of Service 
A, L. F. Sotskov, proudly reported to Andropov that 
operation MUREN had been successfully completed. 
Though the MUREN file fails to mention it, that judgment 
was doubtless revised the following year. The hardening 
of Carter’s policy to the Soviet Union was evident even 
before the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan at the end of 

1979_io3 

PROBABLY NO AMERICAN policymaker at any time 
during the Cold War inspired quite as much fear and 
loathing in Moscow as Ronald Reagan during his first 
term as president. Active measures against Reagan had 
begun during his unsuccessful bid for the Republican 
nomination in 1976. The Centre had no doubt that Reagan 
was far more anti-Soviet than either the incumbent 
president, Gerald Ford, or the Democratic contender, 
Jimmy Carter. As in the cases of Jackson and Brzezinski, 
Service A was ordered to embark on a remarkably wide- 
ranging quest for compromising material. The Centre 
ordered, inter alia, an investigation of reports that 
Reagan’s health had been affected by his father’s 
alcoholism. During his childhood Christmases, Reagan 
later recalled, “there was always a threat hanging over our 
family. We knew holidays were the most likely time for 
Jack [Reagan senior] to jump off the wagon. But such 
painful childhood memories were not the stuff of which 



successful active measures were made. Apart from 
confirming Reagan’s reputation as a Cold War warrior, 
Service A seems to have discovered nothing more 
damaging than alleged evidence of his “weak intellectual 
capabilities.” Service A successfully planted anti-Reagan 
articles in Denmark, France and India, where they 
found more fertile soil than in the United States, but it is 
barely conceivable that KGB active measures had any 
influence on Reagan’s failure to win the Republican 
nomination in 1976. 

The Centre was less involved in trying to influence the 
1980 presidential election than it had been four years 
earlier. Moscow saw little to choose between what it now 
saw as a Carter administration dominated by Brzezinski’s 
hard line policies and Reagan’s long-standing anti- 
Sovietism. “Fed up with Carter and uneasy about 
Reagan,” wrote Dobrynin, “it decided to stay on the 
fence.” After Reagan’s election, Moscow quickly 
regretted its fence-sitting, convinced that the new 
administration represented “the most conservative, 
chauvinist, and bellicose part of American politics ... 
pressing for the restoration of American world leadership 
after the defeat in Vietnam.” To Dobrynin’s dismay, the 
Kremlin succumbed to a “paranoid interpretation” of 
Reagan’s policy, fearful — ^particularly during 1983 — that 
he was planning a nuclear first strike. Dobrynin 
discovered from the Washington resident, Stanislav 
Andreyevich Androsov, the instructions for the vast 



KGB-GRU operation RYAN designed to detect Reagan’s 
non-existent preparations for the surprise attack. But 
RYAN remained so secret that most Soviet ambassadors 
were kept in ignorance of it.^^^ 

It was probably the extreme priority attached by the 
Centre to discrediting the policies of the Reagan 
administration which led Andropov to decree formally on 
April 12, 1982, as one of the last acts of his fifteen-year 
term as chairman of the KGB, that it was the duty of all 
foreign intelligence officers, whatever their “line” or 
department, to participate in active measures. Ensuring 
that Reagan did not serve a second term thus became 
Service A’s most important objective. On February 25, 
1983 the Centre instructed its three American residencies 
to begin planning active measures to ensure Reagan’s 
defeat in the presidential election of November 1984. 
They were ordered to acquire contacts on the staffs of all 
possible presidential candidates and in both party 
headquarters. Residencies outside the United States were 
told to report on the possibility of sending agents to take 
part in this operation. The Centre made clear that any 
candidate, of either party, would be preferable to Reagan. 
Residencies around the world were ordered to popularize 
the slogan “Reagan Means War!” The Centre announced 
five active measures “theses” to be used to discredit 
Reagan’s foreign policy: his militarist adventurism; his 
personal responsibility for accelerating the arms race; his 
support for repressive regimes around the world; his 



administration’s attempts to crush national liberation 
movements; and his responsibility for tension with his 
NATO allies. Active measures “theses” in domestic 
policy included Reagan’s alleged discrimination against 
ethnic minorities; corruption in his administration; and 
Reagan’s subservience to the military- industrial 
complex. 

Reagan’s landslide victory in the 1984 election was 
striking evidence of the limitations of Soviet active 
measures within the United States. Even on university and 
college campuses Reagan was surprised by the 
(admittedly less than unanimous) “outpouring of affection 
and support:” “These students in the eighties seemed so 
different from those that I’d dealt with as governor a 
decade earlier.”^ Though Service A was never willing to 
admit it, there was little it could do to undermine a 
popular president. Its attacks on Reagan fell on much 
more fertile ground in Europe and the Third World, 
however, where his populist appeal to the American way 
was frequently ridiculed. 

ACTIVE MEASURES AGAINST the Main Adversary 
were usually more effective outside than inside the United 
States. One of Service A’s most successful tactics was its 
use of forgeries of US documents shown in confidence to 
Third World leaders to alert them to supposedly hostile 
operations against them by the CIA and other American 
agencies. Since most of these forgeries were never made 



public, the United States was not usually able to challenge 
their authenticity. One characteristic example in the files 
noted by Mitrokhin was operation KULBIT in the 
Republic of Guinea in 1975. The operation was based on 
three French language leaflets attacking the government 
of President Sekou Toure, allegedly produced by the CIA 
station in the Guinean capital, Conakry, but in reality 
fabricated by Service A in Moscow. To heighten the 
dramatic impact of the forgeries, the Soviet ambassador in 
Conakry telephoned the Minister of Security, Mussa 
Diakite, at 6 p.m. on October 16, 1975 to tell him that a 
special emissary had arrived from Moscow with top secret 
information for the President of great importance. At 9 
p.m. the ambassador and O. A. Seliskov, deputy head of 
FCD Directorate K, were ushered by Diakite into the 
presence of Sekou Toure. Seliskov handed the President 
the three fabricated CIA leaflets, the first of which began 
with an attack on the high level of Guinean 
unemployment. According to the KGB file on operation 
KULBIT, on seeing the reference to unemployment, 
Sekou Toure turned to Diakite, waved the pamphlet in his 
face and angrily exclaimed, “The filthy imperialists!” 
Seliskov then described various alleged plots by the CIA 
station to overthrow the President, making the plots 
appear all the more convincing by incorporating into them 
various pieces of information which he knew were 
already known to the Guinean security service. Sekou 
Toure, by now “in an emotional state,” pounded the table 



and declared, “We will take decisive action against the 

US intelligence officers you have identified. They will be 

expelled within twenty- four hours!” When he calmed 

down, the President observed, as Service A had intended, 

that some of Seliskov’s information coincided with 

intelligence already in the possession of his security 
111 

service.^ 

Sekou Toure was profuse in his thanks for the KGB 
disinformation: “We highly appreciate the concern shown 
by our Soviet comrades. This is not Chile, and we are not 
going to allow the same events [the overthrow of the 
President] to happen in our country.” He asked Seliskov 
how his top secret information on the machinations of the 
CIA, supposedly obtained from “important and reliable 
sources in the United States,” should be handled. “At your 
own discretion,” replied Seliskov graciously. Sekou Toure 
asked him to convey his “deepest gratitude” to the 
appropriate Soviet authorities and asked to be kept 
informed about future imperialist threats to the security of 
the Guinean Republic. 

The fabrication of compromising US documents and 
imaginary CIA plots continued into the Gorbachev era. In 
addition to the “silent forgeries” shown privately to Sekou 
Toure and other gullible political leaders around the 
world, forgeries were used to promote media campaigns: 
among them, in 1987, a forged letter from the DCI, 
William Casey, on plans to overthrow the Indian prime 
minister, Rajiv Gandhi; in 1988, bogus instructions from 



Reagan to destabilize Panama; and in 1989, a fabricated 
letter from the South African foreign minister, “Pik” 
Botha, referring to a sinister but non-existent secret 
agreement with the United States. 

Probably the most successful anti-American active 
measure of the Gorbachev era, promoted by a mixture of 
overt propaganda and covert action by Service A, was the 
story that the AIDS virus had been “manufactured” by 
American biological warfare specialists at Fort Detrick in 
Maryland. An East German, Russian-bom physicist. 
Professor Jacob Segal, claimed on the basis of 
“circumstantial evidence” (later wholly discredited) that 
AIDS had been artificially synthesized at Fort Detrick 
from two natural viruses, VISNA and HTLV-1. Thus 
fortified by spurious scientific jargon, the AIDS 
fabrication not merely swept through the Third World, but 
took in some of the Western media as well. In October 
1986 the conservative British Sunday Express made it its 
main front-page story. During the first six months of 1987 
alone, the story received major news coverage in over 
forty Third World countries. 

At the very height of its success, however, the AIDS 
fabrication was compromised by a combination of 
Western protests and “new thinking” in Soviet foreign 
policy. “We tell the truth and nothing but the truth,” 
Gorbachev proudly proclaimed at a Moscow press 
conference in July 1987. Faced with official American 
protests and the repudiation of the AIDS story by the 



international scientific community, the Kremlin for the 
first time showed signs of embarrassment at a successful 
active measures campaign. In August 1987 US officials in 
Moscow were informed that the story was officially 
disowned and Soviet media coverage of it came to an 
abrupt halt. 

The AIDS fabrication, however, was swiftly followed 
by other, equally scurrilous anti-American active 
measures in the Third World, some of which also seduced 
sections of the Western media. Among the most 
successful was the “baby parts” story, alleging that rich 
Americans were butchering Third World children in order 
to use their bodies for organ transplants in the United 
States. In September 1988 a motion in the European 
Parliament condemning the alleged trafficking in “baby 
parts,” proposed by a French Communist MEP, passed on 
a show of hands in a poorly attended session. 

Even the end of the Cold War did little to diminish the 
enthusiasm for active measures of both Kryuchkov, who 
became chairman of the KGB in 1988, and Leonid 
Shebarshin, who succeeded him as head of the FCD. 
Shebarshin, who had made his reputation as resident in 
India from 1975 to 1977 in part by the success of his 
active measures operations, was wont to speak 
“nostalgically about the old days, about disinformation — 
forging documents, creating sensations for the press. 

Not all KGB personnel, however, shared their chiefs’ 
continuing enthusiasm for active measures. Kryuchkov 



complained in September 1990 that some FCD officers in 
both Moscow and foreign residencies “underestimate the 
importance and the role of measures designed to promote 
influence.” He issued a formal “Order of the Chairman of 
the KGB” requiring “refinement of the work of the 
foreign intelligence service in the field of active 
measures” and insisting that “their importance in 
intelligence work is continuing to grow:” 

In effect the joint political and operational scenario 
and the interests of the Soviet state and its society 
require the KGB foreign intelligence service to 
introduce active measures with greater ingenuity, 
inventiveness and secrecy which will enhance the 
level of their effectiveness ... Work on active 
measures is to be considered one of the most 
important functions of the KGB’s foreign 
intelligence service. 

The FCD training school, the Andropov Institute, was 
instructed to prepare new “specialist courses in active 
measures.” Among the most important “themes” for 
active measures was to frighten off support by the West — 
in particular the United States — for nationalist movements 
in the Baltic republics and other parts of the Soviet Union: 

In Western government and political circles and in 
influential emigre groups, it is important ... to 



strengthen the conviction that an adventurist gamble 
on the disintegration of the Soviet Federation and 
statehood would lead to a disruption of 
contemporary international relations with the 
attendant unpredictable consequences.^ 

Amid the active measures promoted by the SVR in the 
mid-1990s there remained some echoes of its KGB past. 
Yeltsin’s memoir, The View from the Kremlin, published 
in the West in 1994, ends with an appendix which 
contains two specially selected examples of KGB 
documents in the secret archives of the Russian president. 
One concerns the assassination of John F. Kennedy. The 
KGB documents on this topic, probably drawn to 
Yeltsin’s attention by the SVR (then headed by Yevgeni 
Primakov), support the theory formerly propagated by 
Service A that Oswald had been selected as the assassin 
by “a group of Texas financiers and industrialists headed 
by millionaire Hunt:” 

Oswald was the most suitable figure for executing a 
terrorist act against Kennedy because his past 
allowed for the organization of a widespread 
propaganda campaign accusing the Soviet Union, 
Cuba, and the US Communist party of involvement 
in the assassination. But ... Ruby and the real 
instigators of Kennedy’s murder did not take into 
account the fact that Oswald suffered from 



psychiatric illness. When Ruby realized that after a 
prolonged interrogation Oswald was capable of 
confessing everything, Ruby immediately liquidated 
Oswald. 

No conspiracy theory of the Cold War era seems to have 
greater staying power than that generated by the death of 
President John F. Kennedy. 



FIFTEEN 


PROGRESS OPERATIONS 


Part 1: Crushing the Prague Spring 


The KGB and its predecessors had played a crucial part in 
the creation of the Soviet Bloc after the Second World 
War. Throughout eastern Europe, Communistcontrolled 
security services, set up in the image of the KGB and 
overseen — except in Yugoslavia and Albania — ^by Soviet 
“advisers,” supervised the transition to so-called 
“people’s democracies.” Political development in most 
east European states followed the same basic pattern. 
Coalition governments with significant numbers of non- 
Communist ministers, but with the newly founded 
security services and the other main levers of power in 
Communist hands, were established immediately after 
German forces had been driven out. Following intervals 
ranging from a few months to three years, these 



governments were replaced by bogus, Communist-mn 
coalitions which paved the way for Stalinist one-party 
states taking their lead from Moscow. ^ 

The German Communist leader Walter Ulbricht 
announced to his inner circle on his return to Berlin from 
exile in Moscow on April 30, 1945: “It’s got to look 
democratic, but we must have everything under our 
control.”^ Because a democratic facade had to be 
preserved throughout eastern Europe, the open use of 
force to exclude non-Communist Parties from power had, 
so far as possible, to be avoided. Instead, the new security 
services took the lead in intimidation behind the scenes, 
using what became known in Hungary as “salami 
tactics” — slicing off one layer of opposition after another. 
Finally, the one-party people’s democracies, purged of all 
visible dissent, were legitimized by huge and fraudulent 
Communist majorities in elections rigged by the security 
services.^ 

During the early years of the Soviet Bloc, Soviet 
advisers kept the new security services on a tight rein. 
The witch-hunts and show trials designed to eliminate 
mostly imaginary supporters of Tito and Zionism from the 
leadership of the ruling Communist Parties of eastern 
Europe were orchestrated from Moscow. One of the 
alleged accomplices of the Hungarian Minister of the 
Interior, Laszlo Rajk, in the non-existent Titoist plot for 
which Rajk was executed in 1949, noted how, during his 



interrogation, officers of the Hungarian security service 
“smiled a flattering, servile smile when the Russians 
spoke to them” and “reacted to the most witless jokes of 
the [MGB] officers with obsequious trumpetings of 
immoderate laughter.”^ 

Even after Stalin’s death, any Soviet Bloc intelligence 
officer of whom the KGB disapproved became a marked 
man. Among them was Ernst Wollweber, head of the East 
German Stasi from 1953 to 1957, whose long connection 
with Soviet intelligence went back to his years as an 
NKVD agent in the 1930s, specializing in marine 
sabotage. Wollweber, however, had come to dislike 
Moscow’s habit of issuing peremptory orders and 
resented the fact that the KGB kept him ill-informed on 
its operations in West Germany. The KGB also distrusted 
Wollweber’s current mistress, Clara Vater, a German 
Communist who, like many of her comrades, had been 
unjustly imprisoned during Stalin’s Terror.^ Remarkably, 
it placed both her and her daughter, whom Wollweber had 
adopted, under surveillance inside East Germany. 
Wollweber was succeeded in 1957 by the sycophantically 
pro- Soviet Erich Mielke, who remained in office with 
Moscow’s blessing until 1989, becoming one of the 
world’s longest serving intelligence chiefs.^ 

ON EACH OF the three occasions when the Red Army 
intervened to restore pro- Soviet orthodoxy in a wayward 



Communist state — Hungary in 1956, Czechoslovakia in 
1968, Afghanistan in 1979 — the KGB played a prominent 
part in what was euphemistically termed the process of 
“normalization.” When the Hungarian uprising began in 
October 1956 with mass demonstrations calling for free 
elections and the withdrawal of Soviet troops, the KGB 
chairman. General Ivan Aleksandrovich Serov, flew to 
Budapest to take personal charge of KGB operations. At 
an emergency meeting of security and police officers in 
the interior ministry, Serov denounced their reluctance to 
fire on the demonstrators: “The fascists and imperialists 
are bringing out their shock troops into the streets of 
Budapest, and yet there are still comrades in your 
country’s armed forces who hesitate to use arms!” Sandor 
Kopacsi, the Budapest chief of police, who was soon to 
side with the freedom fighters, replied scornfully: 

Evidently the comrade adviser from Moscow has not 
yet had time to inform himself of the situation in our 
country. We need to tell him that these are not 
“fascists” or other “imperialists” who are organizing 
the demonstration; they come from the universities, 
the handpicked sons and daughters of peasants and 
workers, the fine flower of our country’s 
intelligentsia which is demanding its rights . . J 

A quarter of a century later Kopacsi still vividly recalled 
the long, withering glare in his direction from Serov’s 



steel-blue eyes. Shortly before Kopacsi escaped to the 
West, Serov told him, “I’m going to have you hanged 
from the highest tree in Budapest!” On the evening of 
November 3, 1956 a Hungarian delegation headed by Pal 
Maleter, the minister of defense, was invited to Soviet 
military headquarters at Tokol to discuss final details of 
the Red Army’s withdrawal from Hungarian soil. At 
midnight, while toasts were being drunk, Serov, 
brandishing a Mauser pistol, burst into the room at the 
head of a group of KGB officers and arrested Maleter and 
his colleagues. A series of mock executions over the next 
few hours convinced each member of the Hungarian 
delegation that all his colleagues had been shot.^ At 4 a.m. 
on November 4 the Red Army began the suppression of 
the Hungarian uprising. Serov and his deputy, KGB 
General K. Grebennik, who became military commandant 
of Budapest, stayed on to supervise the “normalization.”^ 
Though it was not until after the Prague Spring of 1968 
that the Red Army intervened again to enforce Soviet 
ideological orthodoxy, Moscow showed growing anxiety 
during the 1960s at increasing Western influence within 
the Soviet Bloc. The KGB reported that the West was 
engaged in wide-ranging “subversive activity in the 
political and ideological sphere against the socialist 
countries ... seeking to persuade the population of the 
superiority of the Western way of life.” The “subversion” 
took many forms: broadcasting, propagandist 

publications, information distributed by Western 



embassies, East- West cultural and scientific exchanges, 
tourism and letterwriting. In the Centre’s view. Western 
radio stations such as the BBC World Service and Radio 
Liberty threatened to cause “immense harm” by 
broadcasting propaganda designed to weaken the fraternal 
ties between the Soviet Union and the socialist states of 
eastern Europe. What most worried the KGB was that 
“the broadcasts were popular with the intelligentsia and 
young people.” According to statistics probably obtained 
from its Hungarian ally, the AVH, over 20 per cent of 
young people in Hungary listened to Western radio 
stations. During 1964 approximately fifty million postal 
items were exchanged between Hungarian citizens and the 
West, eight million more than in 1963. The KGB was also 
exercised by the growth in east European visitors to the 
West, who were in danger of returning with subversive 
ideas. In 1964 168,000 Hungarians and 150,000 

Czechoslovaks visited Western countries. Worse still, in 
the Centre’s view, many were unsupervised during their 
visits. The KGB complained that its Polish ally, the SB, 
had no officers in its foreign residencies who were 
responsible for monitoring the behavior of Polish tourists 
and Poles studying abroad. In 1964 34,500 Poles traveled 
to the West as individuals rather than as members of 
groups. 

The KGB kept somewhat bizarre statistics of “harmful 
attitudes” and “hostile acts” in the Soviet Bloc, which it 



tended to lump together: such disparate phenomena as 
enthusiasm for Western pop music with cases of 
ideological deviation. In both 1965 and 1966 Hungarian 
young people were said to have been guilty of 
approximately 87,000 “harmful attitudes” and “hostile 
acts.” According to classified official statistics, the figure 
fell reassuringly, if somewhat surprisingly, to 68,000 in 
1968 and remained at about that level for the next decade. 
Disturbingly, however, about 30 per cent of the cases 
recorded concerned members of the Communist youth 
organization, Komsomol. 

“The West’s subversive activities,” complained one 
KGB report, were “harming the cause of Socialist 
construction” throughout the Soviet Bloc, encouraging 
nationalist tendencies in the states of eastern Europe and 
damaging their ties with the Soviet Union. The greatest 
harm was being done among the intelligentsia and young 
people. The KGB noted “an unhealthy tendency” among 
writers towards “ideological co-existence” with the West 
and a growing belief that literature was no business of the 
Party. Students showed a worrying tendency to set up 
independent non-Party organizations for “free discussion 
on the model of English clubs.” One undated KGB report 
picked out two subversive texts currently attracting 
“growing interest:” The New Class by the heretical 
Yugoslav Communist Milovan Djilas, and the works of 
the late nineteenth-century German philosopher Friedrich 
Nietzsche. 



It is easy to see why Djilas’s devastating expose of the 
Soviet system as a co-optive oligarchy run by a privileged 
Party nomenklatura should have been seen as so 
subversive. In 1963 the twenty-year-old Russian dissident 
Vladimir Bukovsky was sent to psychiatric hospital for 
possessing a copy of it. Even for KGB officers The New 
Class was seen as a potentially dangerous text. When 
General Oleg Kalugin finally read the book in the KGB 
library in 1981, twenty- four years after its publication in 
the West, he found himself secretly agreeing with it.^^ 
Why Nietzsche should have been mentioned in the same 
breath as Djilas is more puzzling. His call for a 
“revaluation of all values” so that the life force of the 
strongest should not be hampered by the weak, though 
bearing some relation to the actual practice of Stalinism, 
was ideological anathema. But the works of Nietzsche, 
unlike those of Djilas, were scarcely likely to subvert the 
youth of the Soviet Bloc. The author of the KGB report 
probably knew no more about the great German 
philosopher than that he was a well-known enemy of 
Marxism. 

The first stirrings of reform in Czechoslovakia in the 
mid-1960s, however, caused relatively little concern in 
the Centre. The chief target of the reformers, the aging 
and truculent Czechoslovak Communist Party (CPCz) 
leader, Antonin Novotny, was increasingly regarded in 
Moscow as a neo- Stalinist nuisance rather than as a 
bulwark against revisionism. In December 1967 Brezhnev 



made an unscheduled one-day visit to Prague at the 
request of Novotny, who was under pressure to relinquish 
the post of First Secretary, which he had hitherto 
combined with that of president. Brezhnev refused to 
intervene, telling Novotny bluntly to deal with the 
problem himself. Deprived of Soviet support, Novotny 
gave way to the reformers. 

The election of the 46-year-old Alexander Dubcek as 
the new First Secretary on January 5, 1968 initially 
aroused no disquiet in either the Kremlin or the Centre. 
Dubcek had spent most of his childhood in the Soviet 
Union, graduating with honors from the Moscow Higher 
Party School in 1958, and was condescendingly known 
within the KGB as “Our Sasha.” When the Czechoslovak 
attempt to create “Socialism with a human face” began, 
the FCD Eleventh (East European) Department at first 
concluded that “Our Sasha” was being cleverly 
manipulated by “bourgeois elements” in the CPCz. Once 
it became clear that Dubcek was himself one of the 
moving forces behind the reforms, the Centre felt a sense 
of personal betrayal. 

Dubcek believed, in retrospect, that Moscow took a 
secret decision to use the Red Army to crush the Prague 
Spring little more than two months after he succeeded 
Novotny: 

Under Novotny and his predecessors, the Soviets had 

been permitted to control the Czechoslovak armed 



forces and secret police in various ways, which 
included an implicit “right” to approve key 
appointments. It was apparently not until mid-March 
that they realized that their proxies might be fired 
and replaced without their consent and decided to 
step in.^^ 

In reality Brezhnev remained unsure about the wisdom of 
military intervention until almost the eve of the August 
invasion. The Soviet prime minister, Alexei Kosygin, 
shared some of Brezhnev’s doubts. Both, however, 
gradually gave way to the hardliners in the Politburo. 

The case for military intervention was first put at the 
Politburo meeting on March 21 by the Ukrainian Party 
secretary, Petr Yefimovich Shelest, who declared that the 
fate of the whole “socialist camp” was at stake in the 
Prague Spring. Though it was “essential to seek out the 
healthy [pro- Soviet] forces in Czechoslovakia more 
actively,” he argued that “military measures” would also 
be necessary. Shelest was vigorously supported by the 
KGB chairman, Yuri Andropov, who called for “concrete 
measures” to prepare for armed intervention.^^ Though as 
yet only a candidate (non-voting) member of the 
Politburo, Andropov became an increasingly influential 
voice during the Czechoslovak crisis, willing to challenge 
Kosygin and other more senior figures who appeared 
reluctant to use force.^^ 



As Soviet ambassador in Budapest in 1956, Andropov 
had played a key role in suppressing the Hungarian 
Revolution. His insistence that the threat of counter- 
revolution had reached a critical stage helped to persuade 
an initially reluctant Khrushchev to agree to military 
intervention.^^ An admiring junior diplomat in the Soviet 
embassy later recalled how Andropov had been the first to 
“see through” the reformist prime minister, Imre Nagy, 
and had seemed completely in control of events even as 
Soviet tanks entered Budapest: “He was so calm — even 
when bullets were flying, when everyone else at the 
embassy felt like we were in a besieged fortress. As 
well as being an uncompromising advocate of force, 
Andropov had demonstrated his mastery of deception, 
successfully persuading Nagy that the Red Army was 
being withdrawn while simultaneously plotting his 
overthrow. When the Hungarian commander-in-chief 
phoned the Prime Minister’s office early on November 4 
to report the Soviet attack, Nagy told him, “Ambassador 
Andropov is with me and assures me there’s been some 
mistake and the Soviet government did not order an attack 
on Hungary. The Ambassador and I are trying to call 
Moscow.”^^ 

In Czechoslovakia in 1968, as in Hungary in 1956, 
Andropov’s strategy was based on a mixture of deception 
and military might. Among the main instruments of 
deception during the Prague Spring were KGB illegals, all 



disguised as Westerners. Their deployment in 
Czechoslovakia in the first of what were henceforth 
termed PROGRESS operations marked a major 
innovation in the KGB’s use of illegals. Hitherto illegals 
had been sent overwhelmingly to the West rather than the 
East. Most of those deployed within the Soviet Bloc had 
been sent on missions (codenamed BAYKAL) either to 
cultivate Western tourists or to monitor contacts between 
Soviet citizens and Westerners. In 1966 and 1967, for 
example, a number of illegals were sent to Bulgarian 
Black Sea resorts to mingle with the growing number of 
Western holidaymakers and look for possible recruits. 
The illegal Stanislav Federovich Malotenko visited tourist 
areas of Ukraine, Bulgaria, Romania and Czechoslovakia 
posing as a Western visitor in order to investigate, inter 
alia, “how willingly women agents agreed to have 
intimate relations with foreigners without permission” 
from the KGB.^^ 

During the Prague Spring illegals, posing as Western 
tourists, journalists, business people and students, were 
for the first time used in significant numbers in a country 
of the Soviet Bloc for both intelligence collection and 
active measures. Czechoslovak counter-revolutionaries, 
the Centre believed, would be much franker in revealing 
their subversive designs to those they believed Western 
sympathizers than to their neighbors in eastern Europe. 
Even within the FCD the PROGRESS operation in 
Czechoslovakia was known only to a small circle of 



senior officers. Initially the PROGRESS file was kept in 
the office of the head of Directorate S (Illegals), General 
Anatoli Ivanovich Lazarev, though, as operations in 
Czechoslovakia expanded, the group within the 
directorate who were privy to the secret also widened.^^ 

Of the first twenty illegals selected by the Centre for 
PROGRESS operations in Czechoslovakia during 1968,^^ 
at least five (GROMOV, SADKO, SEVIDOV, 
VLADIMIR and VLAS)^^ and probably another two 
(GURYEV and YEVDOKIMOV) posed as West 
Germans. There were also three bogus Austrians 
(ARTYOMOVA, DIM and VIKTOR)^ ^ and three bogus 
Britons (BELYAKOV, USKOV and VALYA),^^ 
fictitious Swiss (ALLA^^ and SEP^^), one Lebanese 
(YEFRAT^^) and one Mexican (ROY^^).^^ Probably in 
March, Andropov ordered that by May 12 at least fifteen 
of the illegals should be deployed in Czechoslovakia — 
more than had ever been despatched to any Western 
country in so short a period of time. Each was given a 
monthly allowance of 300 dollars as well as travel 
expenses and enough money to rent an apartment. 

Andropov also expanded the KGB legal representation 
in Prague. In addition to the KGB liaison office, headed 
by M. G. Kotov, which had been operating in the 
headquarters of the StB (its Czechoslovak equivalent) for 
the past twenty years, Andropov secretly established an 
undeclared KGB residency, headed by V. V. 



Surzhaninov, which began work in the Soviet embassy on 
April 26.^^ The deputy head of FCD Directorate S, G. F. 
Borzov, and another senior Line N officer, V. K. Umnov, 
were sent to the residency to co-ordinate the work of the 
illegals.^^ The main task both of the residency’s Line PR 
and of the KGB liaison with the StB was to identify 
reliable, pro- Soviet members of the CPCz to form a 
quisling government after a Soviet invasion. At the top of 
their list the KGB put four hardline members of the CPCz 
Presidium — Alois Indra, Jozef Lenart, Drahomir Kolder 
and Vasil Bil’ak — and a former minister of the interior, 
Rudolf Barak, who had been dismissed and imprisoned in 
1962, officially for embezzlement of Party funds but in 
reality for using the StB to collect an incriminating 
dossier on Novotny.^ ^ 

KGB officers in Prague had little difficulty in arranging 
meetings with Indra, Lenart, Kolder and Bil’ak, who were 
regular visitors to the Soviet embassy. It was considered 
too risky, however, to approach Barak directly after his 
release from prison early in May. Instead, the KGB 
residency used a female illegal, Galina Leonidovna 
Linitskaya (codenamed ALLA), operating with a Swiss 
passport in the name of Maria Werner, to make the first 
approach to Barak. For some years the vivacious ALLA 
had specialized in making contact with Western visitors to 
the Soviet Union who were of interest to the KGB. Her 
KGB file primly complains that she was “too sexually 



stimulated” and, despite having a daughter, “not a family 
person” (not a criticism which appears in the files of male 
illegals). ALLA had first met Barak in 1961, when he was 
minister of the interior, and succeeded in renewing 
contact with him soon after his release from prison. At 
ALLA’s request, Barak agreed to a meeting with B. S. 
Ivanov of the KGB residency.^^ 

Indra, Lenart, Kolder and Bil’ak were all to prove 
stalwarts of the neo- Stalinist regime which later presided 
over the destruction of “Socialism with a human face.” 
Barak, however, proved far less useful than the Prague 
residency had hoped, partly because of resentment — even 
by some pro- Soviet members of the CPCz leadership — at 
his brutality as minister of the interior when he had been 
in charge of the StB. He was not fully rehabilitated until 
1975, seven years after his release from prison.^^ 

THE KGB ILLEGALS deployed in Czechoslovakia had 
two main tasks: to penetrate the allegedly counter- 
revolutionary groups springing up during the Prague 
Spring in order to report on their subversive intentions; 
and to implement a series of active measures designed to 
discredit them. The main task of penetration was entrusted 
to YEFRAT, GURYEV, YEVDOKIMOV, GROMOV 
and SADKO.^^ Their chief targets were what the Centre 
saw as the main sources of subversive ideas: 

• the Union of Writers (in particular its 



chairman, Eduard Goldst Acker, and vice-chairman, 
Jan Prochazka, and the celebrated authors Pavel 
Kohout and Milan Kundera); 

• radical journals which had escaped 
Communist control such as the Union of Writers’ 
Literdrm Listy and the Socialist Party’s Svobodne 
slovo, as well as the increasingly unorthodox 
Communist Party newspaper. Rude prdvo; 

• leading reformists in television and radio (in 
particular Jifi Pelikan, the director-general of 
Czechoslovak television); 

• Charles University, especially its philosophy 
department, which took the lead in pressing for a 
new law protecting academic freedom, and leading 
student activists such as Lubomir Holecek and Jifi 
Mailer; 

• K-231, a club of former political prisoners 
who had been jailed under the notorious Article 231 
of the Czechoslovak criminal code; 

• KAN, the club of non-Party activists, formed 
in early April to give those who were not Party 
members the opportunity to participate in public life 
and share in the building of “a new political system 
— hitherto never realized in history — democratic 
socialism;” 

• and the Socialist and People’s Parties, 
struggling to recover the independent existence they 
had lost after the Communist coup in 1948.^^ 



One of the defining moments of the Prague Spring, 
which epitomized the new climate of political freedom 
and the near-collapse of official censorship, was the May 
Day procession through the capital, seen on television 
throughout the country. Instead of the usual tedious 
display of sycophantic admiration for the Party leadership 
and platitudinous slogans celebrating friendship with the 
Soviet Union, there was a spontaneous celebration of 
popular support for the reform movement combined with 
irreverent messages for Moscow such as the banners 
proclaiming “With the Soviet Union for ever — but not a 
day longer!” and “Long live the USSR — ^but at its own 
expense!” Dubcek remembered the day “with deep 
emotion,” “truly touched” by the support for him from the 
former political prisoners of K-231 and the non-Party 
activists of KAN. For Moscow, however, the day was an 
outrageous counter-revolutionary provocation which 
demonstrated that the Czechoslovak one-party state was 
in mortal danger.^^ 

The danger was all the greater because, in the Centre’s 
view, the StB was becoming increasingly unreliable. 
Probably Moscow’s leading bete noire in Oldfich 
Cemik’s government, which took power in April, was the 
interior minister, Josef Pavel, who was responsible for the 
StB. Ironically, the KGB placed much of the blame for 
Pavel’s appointment on Lubomir Strougal, who later 
turned against the reformists and played a prominent part 
in the return to pro- Soviet orthodoxy. According to a 



report in the KGB files, Strougal came into Cemik’s 
office soon after his appointment as prime minister and, 
fearing that the office was bugged, asked him to come for 
a stroll by the river Vltava, which runs through the center 
of Prague. During their walk Strougal urged Cemik to 
give Pavel the interior ministry. Because Pavel had spent 
some years in prison during the early 1950s, Strougal 
argued that he could be relied upon to ensure that the 
police and the StB did not abuse their powers. Cerik 
allegedly agreed with his arguments. In late April, soon 
after becoming Interior Minister, Pavel announced that 
both the ministry and the StB were henceforth to be under 
government — not Party — control, and that a series of 
senior officials were to be sacked. Among them was the 
pro-Soviet head of the StB, Josef Houska, who was 
dismissed in June. Some weeks before he left, he handed 
the KGB photocopies of a series of StB personnel files. 

On May 1 0 Aleksei Kosygin, the Soviet prime minister, 
sent Cerik, his Czech counterpart, an outraged letter 
complaining, among other things, that “agents and 
saboteurs” disguised as Western tourists had been able to 
penetrate Czechoslovakia because of poor border 
security.^^ What Kosygin predictably failed to mention, 
however, was that the most active agents and all the 
saboteurs with Western passports were KGB illegals. On 
the very day he sent his letter, GROMOV ( Vasili 
Antonovich Gordievsky) and GURYEV (Valentin 



Aleksandrovich Gutin), both posing as West Germans, 
were attempting to kidnap two of the most eloquent 
tribunes of the Prague Spring. GROMOV had recent 
experience in kidnapping. Only a month earlier he had 
been decorated for an assignment in Sweden, which 
involved exfiltrating another illegal, FAUST, who was 
considered by the Centre to have developed a persecution 
syndrome. Once back in the Soviet Union, FAUST had 
been sent to a psychiatric hospital for a year, then released 
and sacked from the KGB.^^ 

The targets selected for exfiltration by GROMOV and 
GURYEV in May 1968 were Professor Vaclav Cemy and 
Jan Prochizka.^^ Vaclav Cemy (codenamed TEMNY),^^ 
one of Czechoslovakia’s leading authorities on Romance 
literature, had been expelled from his chair at Charles 
University after the Communist coup in 1948 but re- 
emerged during the Prague Spring as a founder member 
of KAN and an eloquent advocate of academic freedom. 
At the June 1967 Congress of the Writers Union, Jan 
Prochizka had been one of those who took the lead in 
denouncing official censorship and demanding “freedom 
of creativity.”^^ Claiming to be concerned for his safety, 
GURYEV tried to persuade Cemy that he was in serious 
personal danger (presumably from the hardline opponents 
of reform) and offered to find him a temporary hiding 
place. GROMOV delivered a similar message to 
Prochizka. Once persuaded of the need to hide, both 



Cemy and Prochizka were to be handed over to thugs 
from Service V (the FCD “special actions” department), 
who would drive them in a car with CD plates which 
could cross unchecked into East Germany. If they 
resisted, Cemy and Prochizka were to be subdued with 
what the operational file euphemistically describes as 
“special substances.” 

The operation, however, was a miserable failure. After 
the persecution Cemy had suffered during the previous 
twenty years, GURYEV could not persuade him that he 
was in any greater danger than usual. GROMOV 
discovered to his dismay that Prochizka had been supplied 
with a bodyguard by Pavel. The Centre had also 
overlooked the language problems involved in the 
operation. Though Cemy was a good linguist, Prochizka 
spoke only Czech. Posing as a non-Czech-speaking West 
German, GROMOV found it difficult to communicate 
with him. Though he could probably have made himself 
understood in Russian, he would have risked revealing his 
real identity. After a few weeks GURYEV and 
GROMOV abandoned their kidnap attempts. 

In addition to their other missions during the Prague 
Spring, the illegals were tasked with a series of active 
measures collectively codenamed KHODOKI 
(“gobetweens”), which were intended to justify a Soviet 
invasion by fabricating evidence of a counter- 
revolutionary conspiracy by Czechoslovak “rightists” and 



Western intelligence services. Posing as sympathetic 
Westerners, the illegals tried to persuade editors and 
journalists to publish attacks on the Soviet Union and 
other provocative articles. They also attempted to interest 
Cemy and K-231 in accepting aid from a fictitious 
underground organization allegedly supplied with arms by 
the West. Josef Houska, the StB chief sacked by Pavel in 
June, was secretly informed of operation KHODOKI and 
agreed to co-operate with it.^^ 

By mid- July, as part of KHODOKI, the illegals had 
succeeded in planting fabricated evidence of preparations 
for an armed coup. On July 19 Pravda reported the 
discovery of a “secret cache” of American weapons near 
the West German border, some conveniently contained in 
packages marked “Made in USA,” which had allegedly 
been smuggled into Czechoslovakia by “revenge seekers 
and champions of the old order.” The Soviet authorities, it 
claimed, had also obtained a copy of an American “secret 
plan” to overthrow the Prague regime. The press 
throughout the Soviet Bloc followed up Pravda'^ story 
with reports that hidden Western weapons were being 
discovered all over Czechoslovakia. Simultaneously 
bogus intelligence was fed to the StB implicating K-231 
and KAN in a counter-revolutionary conspiracy with 
Western intelligence services. 

The Soviet Politburo met to consider its next step in the 
crisis on the same day that Pravda produced its first 



report on the fictitious counter-revolutionary arms caches. 

Brezhnev began the meeting by proposing a final meeting 

with the Czechoslovak leadership to try to reach a 

negotiated settlement. Only if that failed should they take 

“extreme measures.” Andropov emerged as the chief 

spokesman of those who wanted extreme measures 

immediately. Bilateral talks, he argued, would achieve 

little, while any delay would increase the threat from “the 

rightists:” “They are fighting for survival now, and 

they’re fighting frenziedly ... Both we and they are 

making preparations, and theirs are very thorough. They 

are preparing the working class, the workers’ militia [for a 

conflict].” It was a bad-tempered meeting. Andropov 

became involved in a furious argument with Kosygin, 

whom he accused of “attacking” him, presumably because 

of his call for immediate military intervention. “I am not 

attacking you,” retorted Kosygin. “On the contrary, it is 

you who are attacking me!” The only full member of the 

Politburo who supported Andropov’s opposition to a final 

meeting with the CPCz leadership was K. T. Mazurov. 

However, the foreign minister, Andrei Gromyko, like 

Andropov a non- voting member of the Politburo and later 

his close ally, probably summed up the majority view 

when he declared that meeting Dubcek and his colleagues 

was no more than a necessary preliminary to invasion: 

“Clearly they will not accept our proposals. But then we 

can move to a decision about taking extreme measures 
’’60 



As Gromyko had predicted, the meeting between the 
CPCz Presidium and the Soviet Politburo at the border 
town of Ciemi nad Tisou from July 29 to August 1 ended 
without agreement. After an StB investigation, Pavel 
reported to the CPCz Presidium that the alleged counter- 
revolutionary arms caches were a “provocation.” Though 
the weapons themselves were American, of Second World 
War vintage, some of them were in Soviet-made 
packaging. Other intelligence linking K-231 and KAN 
with Western secret services was also discovered to be 
fabricated. The KGB illegals behind operation 
KHODOKI, however, went undetected. Mitrokhin’s notes 
on KGB files lend some, though not conclusive, support 
to the claim by an StB defector that the KGB planned to 
murder the Soviet wives of a number of Czechoslovak 
citizens in August and blame their deaths on counter- 
revolutionaries. The plan was apparently discovered by 
the StB and aborted. 

At a meeting of the CPCz Party committee of the StB 
early in August, the head of StB foreign intelligence, 
Shuoj Frouz (codenamed FARKAC), argued that the 
KGB advisers in the StB were violating the principles of 
Czechoslovak- Soviet intelligence liaison and should be 
recalled to Moscow. A report of the meeting, at which 
other StB officers supported Frouz, was quickly relayed 
to the KGB.^^ After the Soviet invasion, those who had 
demanded the recall of the KGB advisers were arrested — 



with the significant exception of Frouz, who may well 
have made the demand on KGB instructions in order to 
identify the main anti-Soviet elements in the StB in 
advance of the invasion. 

As well as producing fabricated evidence of a Western 
plot for public consumption, Andropov supplied the 
Politburo throughout the crisis with slanted intelligence 
designed to strengthen its resolve to intervene. Probably 
the most important accurate intelligence on American 
policy to reach the Centre during the Prague Spring came 
from the Washington residency, where the dynamic 34- 
year-old head of Line PR, Oleg Kalugin, gained access to 
what he reported were “absolutely reliable documents” 
proving that neither the CIA nor any other agency was 
manipulating the Czechoslovak reform movement. These 
documents, however, failed to conform to Andropov’s 
conspiracy theory of an imperialist plot and were thus 
kept from the Politburo. On returning to Moscow, 
Kalugin was amazed to discover that the Centre had 
ordered that “my messages should not be shown to 
anyone, and destroyed.” Instead, on Andropov’s orders, 
“The KGB whipped up the fear that Czechoslovakia could 
fall victim to NATO aggression or to a coup.”^^ 

At a meeting in Moscow on August 18, the leaders of 
the Soviet Union and the other four “reliable” members of 
the Warsaw Pact — Bulgaria, East Germany, Hungary and 
Poland — formally agreed on the invasion of 
Czechoslovakia, the biggest armed action in Europe since 



the end of the Second World War.^^ At 4 p.m. on August 
20 a meeting of “reliable” members of the StB was 
briefed by Pavel’s pro- Soviet deputy, Viliam Salgovic, on 
plans for the invasion which was to begin that night and 
assigned tasks to assist the Warsaw Pact forces. Josef 
Houska, dismissed by Pavel two months earlier, returned 
to take charge of the StB. 

At about 9 a.m. on the morning of August 21, with 
Soviet forces already in key positions in Prague, the StB 
veteran Lieutenant Colonel Bohumil Molnir, who had 
been given a specially engraved automatic pistol by the 
former KGB chairman, Ivan Serov, for his assistance in 
crushing the Hungarian Revolution in 1956, briefed the 
group of StB officers selected by the KGB to arrest 
Dubcek and the reformist majority on the CPCz 
Presidium. Escorted by KGB officers, the arrest group 
proceeded to Dubcek’ s office in the Central Committee 
building, where one of them announced in what seemed to 
Dubcek the “mechanical voice” of a second-rate amateur 
actor: “I am placing you in custody in the name of the 
Workers’ and Peasants’ Government led by Comrade 
Indra.” He added, after a pause in which he seemed to be 
remembering his lines, that Dubcek and his colleagues 
would shortly be brought before a revolutionary tribunal, 
also headed by Alois Indra.^^ 

Indra and the other leading members of the quisling 
govemment-in-waiting selected by Moscow were already 



in the Soviet embassy ready to take power. But at this 
point the invasion plan had to be modified. Indra and his 
co-conspirators had mistakenly assured Moscow that the 
invasion would be supported by a majority of the CPCz 
leadership.^^ The fact that Dubcek retained a majority on 
the Presidium as well as overwhelming popular support 
forced Moscow to abandon its plan for a puppet regime 
and bring Dubcek and his colleagues to the Kremlin, 
under KGB escort, to be browbeaten into a degree of 
submission. Brezhnev stuck to the fabricated KGB story 
that “anti-socialist” forces had been preparing a coup: 

Underground command posts and arms caches have 
now come to light. We don’t want to make charges 
against you personally, that you’re guilty. You might 
not even have been aware of it ... 

As the discussion proceeded over the next few days, 
however, the Soviet Politburo passed from attempts to 
justify the invasion and the pretense of comradely 
solidarity to intimidation and coercion. Dubcek felt he 
had no option but to concede the main Soviet demands: 
“It could not have been otherwise. We were managing the 
affairs of an occupied country where the barrel of a Soviet 
gun was trained on our every move.” On August 26 the 
Czechoslovak delegation signed a secret protocol 
accepting a “temporary” occupation by forces of the 
Warsaw Pact. The decisions of the Extraordinary 



Fourteenth Congress of the CPCz hurriedly convened on 
August 22, which had condemned the invasion, were 
annulled. Some of the leading reformists in the Party, 
government, radio and television who had most outraged 
Moscow were dismissed. 

The Kremlin intended the Moscow protocol only as the 
beginning of a process of “normalization” which would 
rapidly turn the Prague Spring into winter. As a later 
official history of the CPCz complained: 

The Right ... still held the decisive positions in the 
Party, the state apparatus and the mass media ... The 
Marxist-Leninist forces in the Party and society led a 
difficult and complicated struggle from August 1968 
to April 1969, characterized by the gradual 
suppression of the Right. 

Of particular concern to Andropov was the continued 
strength of the “Right” in the StB, despite Houska’s arrest 
of some leading reformists. According to KGB reports 
from Prague, the situation was most serious in foreign 
intelligence: 

In the [StB] First [foreign intelligence] Directorate 
nationalist passions were inflamed and there were 
acts of an anti-Soviet nature: removal of the Soviet 
flag, [hostile] slogans, attacks on Soviet military 
units sent to protect the old premises of the First 



Directorate, intelligence officers going underground, 
handing in their official passes, and stopping work in 
protest at the arrival of Soviet troops. 


The Centre was outraged by a series of resolutions passed 
by the plenary committee of the StB First Directorate 
Communist Party: 

1. Communists of the First Directorate 
Communist Party Organization welcome the return 
of the Czechoslovak delegation from Moscow and 
express their joy that comrades Dubcek, Smrkovsky, 
Cemik, Kriegel, Svoboda and others will have the 
possibility of resuming their constitutional and Party 
duties. [In fact, on Soviet insistence, Kriegel was 
sacked.] 

In expressing their confidence in them, the 
Communists of the First Directorate Party 
Organization will continue to give these comrades 
their full support in implementing the [reformist] 
action program of the Czechoslovak Communist 
Party. 

2. The First Directorate Communist Party 
Organization expresses concern about the contents of 
the final communique on the talks in Moscow, which 
reflects the fact that the talks were held in conditions 
of inequality, under pressure and with occupation 
forces present in the Czechoslovak Socialist 
Republic. 



3. The Communists again express their full 
support for the lawfully elected leadership of the 
Czechoslovak Intelligence Service and welcome its 
return to carry out its duties. The Communists 
demand an urgent investigation into all incidents in 
which the orders of this leadership, and also the 
orders of the Minister of Internal Affairs Pavel 
[sacked at Moscow’s insistence], were contravened. 
In this connection, it is also essential to determine 
what role was played by officers of the USSR KGB. 

The Party Organization recognizes the decisions 
of the Fourteenth Congress [annulled by the Moscow 
protocol] as lawful and places responsibility for the 
crisis on the Soviet troops. 

The KGB discovered that the StB resident in New 
York, codenamed PATERA, was trying vainly to 
persuade the Czechoslovak foreign minister, Jifi Hajek, to 
address the United Nations Security Council on the Soviet 
invasion, in defiance of the Moscow protocol. “If we did 
not raise the Czechoslovak question in the Security 
Council,” PATERA insisted, “the nation would declare us 
to be traitors. The StB resident in Washington, his eyes 
brimming with tears, told Oleg Kalugin, “My children 
will hate you for what you’ve done to my country. They 
will never forgive you for what happened. It took 
several years for “healthy forces,” as the KGB referred to 
the Soviet loyalists in the StB, to eradicate all trace of 



revisionism. 

After the Soviet invasion KGB illegals remained 
central to Andropov’s strategy for penetrating and 
destabilizing “rightist” forces. PROGRESS operations 
in Czechoslovakia were augmented by other Soviet Bloc 
intelligence services. On August 25 Mielke, who had 
deployed East German illegals in Czechoslovakia during 
the Prague Spring, informed the Centre that he was 
sending a further contingent to Prague, together with Stasi 
officers to direct their operations and liaise with the KGB 
residency. In September Andropov and Sakharovsky, 
the head of the FCD, traveled to Warsaw and agreed a 
plan for the SB (the Polish KGB) to use both agents and 
illegals to penetrate the Czechoslovak “counter- 
revolutionary underground,” emigre groups and hostile 
intelligence services. 

The most valuable unwitting KGB source among the 
ranks of Czechoslovak “counter-revolutionaries” 
identified in the files seen by Mitrokhin was Leo Lappi 
(codenamed FREDDI), a former political prisoner and 
founder member of K-231. The fact that, though a 
Czechoslovak citizen, Lappi was an ethnic German made 
him far easier to cultivate than the majority of 
Czechoslovak citizens who were not fluent in Western 
languages. The first contact with Lappi was made by 
ALLA, posing as a German- speaking Swiss, in October 
1968.^^ After about two months his cultivation was 



handed over to another female illegal, ARTYOMOVA, 
who had assumed the identity of an Austrian 
businesswoman.^^ From February 1969 onwards, Lappi’s 
case officer was FYODOROV, who, using a West 
German passport in the name of Walter Brade, for the 
next decade became the leading illegal specializing in 
Czechoslovak operations. Since ALLA and 
ARTYOMOVA had reported that Lappi let rooms to 
foreigners, FYODOROV made initial contact with him on 
the pretext that he was a businessman looking for 
accommodation in Prague. 

Lappi had no idea that ALLA, ARTYOMOVA and 
FYODOROV were KGB illegals sent on missions to 
assist in the destruction of the last remnants of “socialism 
with a human face.” Instead, they successfully persuaded 
him that they were Western supporters of the Prague 
Spring, anxious to do what they could to assist in its 
restoration. Given the almost universal revulsion in the 
West at the Soviet occupation, Lappi’s misplaced trust in 
his new Swiss, Austrian and German friends was an 
understandable mistake, cynically exploited by 
FYODOROV. Lappi’s confidence in FYODOROV was 
so complete that he left him in charge of his flat when he 
went on holiday to Romania. He introduced FYODOROV 
both to K-231 activists and to leaders of the Christian 
Democrat, People’s and Socialist Parties, which had tried 
to re-establish themselves during the Prague Spring. 
Lappi regularly acted as translator at FYODOROV’S 



meetings with them. Some of FYODOROV’S reports on 
his meetings with the counter-revolutionaries were rated 
so highly by the Centre that they were forwarded to the 
Politburo. 

What the KGB files do not, of course, report are the 
feelings of the illegals as they betrayed the sometimes 
heroic survivors of the Prague Spring. Unlike the leaders 
of the Soviet Union and the Soviet public, who had no 
first-hand experience of the world outside the Soviet 
Bloc, the illegals knew the West and the reality of life in 
Czechoslovakia too well to have deluded themselves into 
believing that they were engaged in a moral crusade to 
defend socialist values against Western imperialism. 
There were recurrent complaints in FCD Directorate S 
that after postings abroad illegals sometimes returned with 
an “incorrect” attitude towards life in the Soviet Union. 
Occasionally their attitudes were so incorrect that their 
careers were cut short. In 1966 the KGB liaison office in 
Budapest virtuously reported to the Centre a series of 
politically incorrect observations made by the female 
illegal ERNA while returning from leave in Moscow to 
her posting in Canada. Among the comments said to have 
“shocked” her fellow KGB officers were the following: 

In Moscow I was afraid to express my views frankly 
on certain subjects. After all, I could see that they 
thought that I had become more than a bit bourgeois. 

Why did the Party allow a second cult of 



personality to develop in respect of Khrushchev? I 
cannot understand how Khrushchev could take 
decisions on important Party and state matters all on 
his own. And what were the other members of the 
Central Committee doing? Were the consequences of 
the cult of Stalin not still fresh in their minds? 

What is the point now of launching so many 
Sputniks? Would it not be better to attend to more 
important things on earth? Twenty years have gone 
by since the end of the war, but people do not have 
the material goods which they need and deserve, and 
which the humblest inhabitants of the West have 
long enjoyed!^^ 

Very few illegals dared to voice such seditious comments 
openly. But the fact that some undoubtedly thought such 
thoughts cannot fail to have bred in them an increasing 
cynicism, heightened in some cases by their experiences 
in Czechoslovakia. 

Some insight into the attitude of GROMOV, one of the 
first five illegals assigned to the penetration of “rightist” 
groups during the Prague Spring, is provided by the 
recollections of his younger brother, Oleg Antonovich 
Gordievsky, who worked from 1963 to 1972 in the FCD 
Illegals Directorate and Line N in the Copenhagen 
residency. GROMOV had been bom in 1933 and, in 
Oleg’s view, “had grown up among boys bmtalized by 
war,” becoming a cynical, materialistic adult who much 



preferred life in the West to the relative privations of 
Czechoslovakia. When Oleg was informed during his 
training that he had to choose between learning Czech and 
Swedish, his brother told him he would be an idiot not to 
choose Swedish: “If you take Czech, you’ll spend the rest 
of your life sitting in the pathetic consular departments in 
Prague and Bratislava ... [But] Sweden’s a nice country ... 
From there you can go anywhere in Europe. There are 
signs of a less blatant cynicism towards the Czechs in 
FYODOROV’S reports to the Centre. He wrote of the role 
of the Red Army in Czechoslovakia : “The Soviet forces 
play the role of a policeman standing at a crossroads 
where there is heavy traffic; everyone notices him and this 
disciplines the traffic.” The Czechoslovak population, in 
other words, was being cowed into submission. 

In the case of a minority of illegals, their Czechoslovak 
experiences probably had more serious consequences than 
simply an increased level of cynicism. A few years later 
ALLA attempted to commit suicide. Though her KGB file 
attributes the episode solely to the fact that her partner 
had left her,^^ it is difficult to believe that the betrayal of 
the Czechoslovaks ALLA had befriended did not add to 
her emotional scars. A more common reaction by the 
illegals to their experiences in Czechoslovakia was 
probably to turn to alcohol. Unable to stop drinking even 
after he contracted hepatitis B during a mission in south- 
east Asia, GROMOV died in 1972 at the age of only 



thirty-nine.^^ Both BOGUN and his wife also became 
alcoholics. In 1976 he was admitted for “a full course of 
anti-alcohol therapy” at the Burdenko military hospital, 
while his wife was treated for alcoholism in the psycho- 
neurological department of the Central KGB Polyclinic. 
The previous few years, during which BOGUN had 
worked extensively on PROGRESS operations in 
Czechoslovakia and elsewhere in eastern Europe, seem to 
have taken a much heavier psychological toll than his 
earlier period as an illegal in the United States. 

In the case of one member of the Illegals Directorate 
there is no doubt about the shattering impact of the Soviet 
invasion of Czechoslovakia. For GROMOV’ s brother, 
Oleg Gordlevsky, then serving in Copenhagen, “It was 
that dreadful event, that awful day, which determined the 
course of my own life.” The crushing of the Prague 
Spring convinced him that the Soviet one-party state was, 
by its very nature, destructive of human liberties. He 
spent much of the next few years secretly pondering how 
to work for its overthrow before taking the decision to 
become a British penetration agent within the KGB.^^

PROGRESS OPERATIONS 


Part 2: Spying on the Soviet Bloc 


Dubcek later described the eight months after the Soviet 
invasion as “an organized retreat, in which no inch of 
territory was given up without calculated resistance.”^ It 
was a retreat, however, which was doomed to end in 
defeat. Dubcek’ s position and that of the other leading 
reformers was steadily undermined by a combination of 
Soviet pressure, the old guard within the CPCz and 
former allies who decided to throw in their lot with the 
invaders to save their own careers. 

The immediate pretext for Dubcek’ s removal was the 
World Ice Hockey Championship in Stockholm in March 
1969. On March 21, Dubcek later recalled, “The whole 
country watched [on TV] as Czechoslovakia played the 
Soviets; it was much more than ice hockey, of course. It 



was a replay of a lost war ...” The national rejoicings after 
the Czechoslovak victory led the KGB to prepare, with 
assistance from its stooges in the StB, an anti-Soviet riot 
to follow the next match between Czechoslovakia and the 
USSR on March 28. Shortly before the match a team of 
police agents disguised as city workers unloaded a pile of 
paving stones in front of the offices of the Soviet airline, 
Aeroflot, in Wenceslas Square. Prague police documents 
show that the whole operation was directly supervised by 
a Soviet agent in the Czech ministry of the interior.^ 
Immediately after the Czechoslovak team had defeated 
the Soviets for the second time in a week, StB plain 
clothes personnel mingling with the celebrating crowd 
began to throw the conveniently placed stones at the 
Aeroflot office. The office furniture was dragged out on 
to the pavement and set alight. 

Moscow now had the fabricated evidence it required to 
demand that, “The counter-revolution must be beheaded.” 
Dubcek believed he had no option but to resign. 
“Otherwise the Soviets would set up another provocation 
that could lead to further public turmoil and even a 
bloodbath.”^ On April 17 he was succeeded as First 
Secretary of the Czechoslovak Party by the Slovak first 
secretary, Gustav Husak. As Dubcek broadcast the news 
of his replacement, he broke down and wept. 

PROGRESS operations in Czechoslovakia continued. 
A senior officer from FCD Directorate S, Dmitri 
Kirillovich Vetrov, arrived in Prague to supervise and 



coordinate the work of the illegals as they penetrated the 
ranks of the unrepentant reformists.^ Posing as a Swiss 
sympathizer with the Prague Spring, Galina Vinogradova 
(ALLA) was instructed to cultivate Ladislav Lebovic 
(codenamed KHAN), one of the trainers of the victorious 
Czechoslovak ice hockey team which was viewed with 
deep suspicion in the Centre.^ The illegal Yuri Linov 
(KRAVCHENKO), who pretended to be Austrian, 
succeeded in gaining the confidence of the international 
chess grand master and sports columnist Ludek Pachman, 
one of the organizers of the illegal broadcasts transmitted 
in the aftermath of the Soviet invasion. As soon as Linov 
had identified those of Pachman’ s friends and associates 
who were ready to continue “the struggle against the 
Soviet occupiers,” Pachman himself was arrested and 
imprisoned.^ 

Though delighted by Dubcek’s departure, the KGB 
liaison office in Prague remained unenthusiastic about his 
successor, Gustav Husak, who had been imprisoned in 
1952 on trumped-up charges as an alleged Trotskyist and 
“bourgeois nationalist.” “Spending nine years in prison,” 
it reported, “has left its mark on Husak’ s psychology, in 
that he shows unwarranted indulgence towards clear 
adversaries of the Czechoslovak Communist Party line.” 
The KGB liaison office complained to the Centre that 
there was “no genuine internal unity” within the CPCz 
leadership, which was divided between “internationalists” 



such as Bil’ak and Indra, who had supported Soviet 
intervention in August 1968, and “realists” led by 
Strougal, who had opposed intervention but now accepted 
it as a fact of life. The two sides were engaged in a power 
struggle, seeking to gain key positions and place their 
supporters within the Party apparatus.^ Over the next year 
both realists and internationalists had some successes. In 
January 1970 Strougal replaced Cemik as prime minister. 
Simultaneously, however, BiTak was put in charge of an 
operation to purge the CPCz of all reformists during the 
introduction of new Party cards. ^ A fellow hardliner, 
Milos Jakes, head of the Central Committee’s Control and 
Auditing Committee, became his right-hand man and 
regularly reported on the progress of the purge to the 
KGB liaison office.^ Seventeen years later Jakes was to 
succeed Husak as general secretary of the CPCz. 

The Centre’s assessment of the work of the KGB 
liaison office and residency in Prague during 1970 
concluded: 

The bloc of revisionist and anti-socialist forces in the 
Czechoslovak Socialist Republic has suffered a 
political defeat; the legal ideological centers of the 
right-wing have been eliminated; the main 
ideologists of Czechoslovak renewal have been 
removed from the political arena and expelled from 
the Party; and measures have been taken to purge the 
state apparatus of the most active carriers of the 



right-wing danger. However, it would not be right to 
suppose that with the exchange of Party cards the 
Czechoslovak Communist Party has totally purged 
its ranks of hostile and alien elements. 

Indra, whom Moscow had originally intended to take 
power after the invasion at the head of a “Workers’ and 
Peasants’ Government,” was reported by the liaison office 
to be “biding his time,” waiting for an opportunity to 
press his claims as general secretary. His wait was to 
prove in vain. 

KGB agents and Soviet sycophants within the CPCz 
continued to protest that Strougal and other former 
reformists retained far too much influence at the expense 
of the Soviet Union’s true friends. One informant in the 
Ministry of the Interior, Jaroslav Zeman, complained that 
Strougal was discriminating against the internationalists: 
“And what sort of person is Strougal? In 1968 he was 
preparing to emigrate to the West and had currency and 
documents ready for his escape.” While turncoats 
prospered under Strougal’ s patronage, “Officials who 
cooperate with the USSR are looked down on in the 
Czechoslovak Socialist Republic; they are kept in the 
dark, and are not promoted or rewarded.”^^ 

By January 1971 310 foreign intelligence officers had 
been dismissed and 170 expelled from the Party. The 
whole of the senior staff of the internal StB had been 



replaced along with many more junior officers. The 
Centre, however, was not satisfied. The KGB liaison 
office was instructed during 1971 to press the interior 
ministry and the StB “in a tactful manner” to carry out a 
thorough reorganization of Czechoslovak intelligence “in 
view of the fact that the central apparatus was tainted and 
the possibility that committed agents of the adversary 
were present in it.” The Centre wished for active 
assistance from a reformed StB in the collection of 
scientific and technological intelligence, the deployment 
of illegals and other FCD operations. 

Despite continuing doubts about the reliability of some 
StB personnel, the KGB liaison office reported that the 
minister of the interior, Radko Kaska, displayed a 
satisfactory level of subservient cooperation: 

We have not noticed any unjustified or non-objective 
information from Kaska. Up to the present he has 
informed us frankly and in detail about internal 
political processes in Czechoslovakia and about the 
situation within the Ministry of Internal Affairs. 

The KGB was provided with copies of StB operational 
orders and reports, and proposed staff changes were 
submitted for its approval. At Husak’s instructions, 
Kaska began secretly collecting material on “leading 
right-wing personalities” in order to determine how many 
could be held to have broken state laws.^^ The KGB was. 



however, embarrassed to be asked by Kaska in March 
1971 whether it had any “adverse information” on past 
contacts with the West by the chairman of the National 
Assembly, Dalibor Hanes. The Centre was concerned 
that, if it replied to Kaska’ s enquiry, it would give the 
(perfectly accurate) impression that “the KGB is engaged 
in collecting information on officials of fraternal Parties 
in friendly countries.” The head of the KGB liaison office 
in Prague, Ye. G. Sinitsyn, was instructed to reply that it 
had “no reports of links between Hanes and foreign 
intelligence,” but that, since it followed the principle of 
not spying on its allies, it would be unable to respond to 
such requests in future. Sinitsyn was privately informed 
by the Centre that BiTak had complained to the Soviet 
ambassador that Hanes had “taken up incorrect positions” 
during the Prague Spring and that his father had been 
responsible for “crushing workers’ demonstrations in 
Slovakia” between the wars.^^ Soon afterwards Hanes 
was replaced as chairman of the National Assembly by 
the impeccably orthodox Indra.^^ 

On May 4, 1971 Kaska met Semyon Konstantinovich 
Tsvigun, KGB deputy chairman, to report on the progress 
of “normalization.”^^ Tsvigun owed his job almost solely 
to the fact that he was one of Brezhnev’s oldest drinking 
partners. Kalugin found him “downright stupid but 
relatively harmless. Tsvigun cannot have been wholly 
reassured by Kaska’ s briefing. Over the past two years. 



Kaska told him, about 450,000 CPCz members had left or 
been expelled, “making contact between the Party and the 
population more difficult.”^^ With one exception, the 
heads of all directorates in the interior ministry had been 
replaced. In all, about 3,000 of its employees in the StB 
and other agencies had been dismissed. There was, 
however, still widespread evidence of anti-Soviet feeling. 
Soviet films and plays were systematically boycotted. At 
the Czechoslovak premiare of the film The Kremlin 
Chimes there were only five people in the audience; at the 
second showing there were only ten. There were 
numerous anonymous threats, malicious rumors and acts 
of sabotage on the railways. But there were also successes 
to report. The StB had succeeded in setting up a bogus 
organization dedicated to “socialism with a human face,” 
in order to smoke out secret supporters of the Prague 
Spring. Finally, Kaska assured Tsvigun that he and his 
ministry were in close touch with the KGB liaison office 
and its head. General Sinitsyn.^^ 

In the spring of 1972 Andropov had a private meeting 
with Kaska. His manner was more assertive than that of 
Tsvigun a year earlier. He insisted that opposition forces 
were still strong, despite the “stabilization” in 
Czechoslovakia and the strengthening of the Communist 
Party’s authority, and that they were being infiltrated by 
Western intelligence services. Agent penetration of the 
opposition therefore remained essential. The opposition 



source to which Andropov attached most importance 
probably remained Leo Lappi (FREDDI). Still posing as a 
committed West German supporter of the Prague Spring, 
the illegal FYODOROV had regular meetings with Lappi 
in Prague and East Berlin. On January 25, 1972 Fyodor 
Konstantinovich Mortin, who had succeeded Sakharovsky 
as head of the FCD, sought Andropov’s permission to 
trick Lappi into becoming a Soviet agent by a “false flag” 
deception which concealed the role of the KGB. 
Andropov gave his approval on January 29 and 
FYODOROV went ahead with the recruitment, claiming 
to be working for the West German BND. An additional 
reason for the Centre’s interest in Lappi was that his 
brother Karl was a West German citizen who, according 
to KGB files, was “close” to two prominent FRG 
politicians.^^ 

Despite Kaska’s personal sycophancy towards his KGB 
advisers and the extensive purge which he had overseen, 
the Centre remained dissatisfied with the ideological 
purity of the StB. In August 1972 Andropov reported to 
the CPSU Central Committee that “internal adversaries” 
in the StB were striving to prevent the completion of 
“normalization.”^^ A further KGB report to the Central 
Committee in November cited complaints from its agents 
and informers within the Czechoslovak Ministry of 
Internal Affairs that leading posts in the ministry 
continued to be occupied by “people who do not inspire 



political confidence. The KGB also received numerous 
protests from its informants that the disgraced leaders of 
the Prague Spring and their families were being 
insufficiently persecuted. Viliam Salgovic, who had 
assisted the Soviet invasion in 1968 and had been 
promoted to the CPCz Central Committee in 1970, 
complained that the children of “right-wing leaders” were 
being allowed to enter the universities. Worse still, the 
children of three disgraced former members of the 
Presidium — Dubcek, Stefan Sadovsky and Julius Turcek 
— had been given “excellent marks” in their entrance 
examinations.^^ 

Salgovic ’s complaint reflected the self-righteous 
vengefulness of the Soviet sycophants rather than any 
failure to purge the universities. In 1969-70 900 out of 
3,500 university professors were dismissed. All Czech 
literary and cultural journals were closed down. 
Unemployed academics and writers were forced to seek 
new careers as lavatory cleaners, building laborers and 
boiler-room stokers. Soon after winning the Nobel Prize 
for Literature in 1972, Heinrich Boll described 
Czechoslovakia as “a veritable cultural cemetery. 

MANY OF THE reports received by the Centre 
throughout the period of “normalization” concerned 
continued covert feuding within the CPCz leadership. In 
December 1972 Jakes complained to the KGB liaison 



office that Husak had ordered the telephones of all 
Presidium members to be tapped. The working 
atmosphere within the Central Committee was now, he 
claimed, so poisonous that the Novotny era appeared, by 
comparison, a golden age.^^ In February 1973 Jakes and 
three other leading Soviet loyalists — Presidium members 
Karel Hoffmann and Antonin Kapek and party secretary 
Miloslav Hruskovic — again protested to the KGB about 
what they claimed were “attempts to squeeze out 
internationalist Communists from important posts. 
Among other intrigues within the Party leadership 
reported by the KGB to Moscow during 1973 was the 
claim that the realist Prime Minister Strougal was seeking 
to ingratiate himself with Husak’ s internationalist deputy 
Bil’ak by methods which included giving Bil’ak’s 
daughter a present costing 10,000 crowns, debited to the 
budget of the Czechoslovak television service. 

On February 28, 1973 Kaska was killed in an aircrash 
while visiting his Polish opposite number and was 
succeeded as Minister of Internal Affairs by Jaromir 
Obzina, who promptly gave a sycophantic display of his 
internationalist credentials. “For the CPSU and for 
Comrade Brezhnev,” he told the KGB liaison, he was 
“ready to carry out any assignment.”^^ Obzina, however, 
quickly became caught up in Husak’ s attempts to increase 
his personal prestige by combining, like Novotny before 
the Prague Spring, the post of President of the Republic 



with that of General Secretary of the CPCz. At the end of 
1973, probably at Husak’s request, Obzina began trying to 
win over internationalists opposed to his ambitions for the 
presidency. According to KGB reports from Prague, a 
group of Soviet loyalists headed by Hoffmann, Indra, 
Jakes and Kapek (all in close touch with both the KGB 
and the Soviet embassy) continued to resist any attempt to 
combine the two posts. The growing senility of Ludvik 
Svoboda, who had succeeded Novotny as president in 
1968, however, played into Husak’s hands. In May 1975 
he replaced the by now demented Svoboda as head of 
state. Rude prdvo celebrated the occasion by publishing 
five large photographs of Husak, each showing him in the 
company of one of the leaders of the five Warsaw Pact 
countries who had invaded Czechoslovakia in August 
1968.35 

At the time of Husak’s apotheosis, Dubcek was 
working as a mechanic with the Slovak Forestry 
Commission under constant surveillance and frequent 
harassment by the StB.^^ On October 2, 1975 the Centre 
reported to Brezhnev that Dubcek had sent compromising 
material on Husak to the Western media. Based on 
information supplied by Dubcek, the West German and 
Austrian press had reported that during the war Husak had 
accompanied a group of Nazi journalists to the Katyn 
Wood near Smolensk, where the Germans had exhumed 
the bodies of several thousand Polish officers shot by the 



NKVD (an atrocity blamed by Moscow on the Germans). 
Dubcek was twice summoned for questioning by the StB 
at the Slovakian interior ministry. The KGB was deeply 
dissatisfied by the outcome. “At the interrogation,” it 
informed Brezhnev, “Dubcek conducted himself 
provocatively, categorically refusing to answer questions 
and declaring that in future he would protest against being 
subjected to pressure.” Dubcek refused to sign either a 
denial that he had provided the information on Husak or a 
protest at the use of his name by the Western press, and 
threatened to react “decisively” if “repressive measures” 
were taken against him. Husak meanwhile wrote to 
Obzina to protest his innocence of the charges against 
him.^^ 

Despite Husak’ s success in capturing the presidency, 
his power was more circumscribed than Novotny’s a 
decade earlier. His second-in-command, the 
internationalist Bil’ak, enjoyed greater authority and 
influence than any other deputy in eastern Europe. Having 
rejected the idea of a regime wholly dominated by 
notorious hardliners, the Kremlin, with some misgivings, 
regarded the Husak-Bil’ak combination as the best 
available. A KGB report from Prague at the end of the 
decade reported in thinly disguised language that, despite 
growing friction between Husak and Bil’ak, neither was 
attempting to topple the other because they knew that 
Moscow would not allow it: 



Business-like relations between the leaders of 
Czechoslovakia are being maintained largely because 
of the fact that Husak Bil’ak and other members of 
the Presidium of the Czechoslovak Communist Party 
know that the top leadership of the CPSU gave their 
full, firm and uncompromising support to Husak and 
Bil’ak. For both, this is a serious restraining factor 
for maintaining normal working relations between 
the two of them, and the situation in the Presidium of 
the Czechoslovak Communist Party largely depends 
on their mutual relations. 

Despite its jaundiced view of the political leadership, 
the KGB liaison office in Prague was fully satisfied with 
the willingness of Obzina and the StB to do its bidding. 
Obzina, it reported, kept it “objectively informed” both 
about what took place in the CPCz Presidium and about 
the activities of each of its members, Husak included.^^ 
Sinitsyn reported in 1977 that there were “operational 
contacts” between KGB and StB residencies in twenty-six 
countries. In 1975 the StB had agreed to a Soviet 
request to open a residency in Albania, a country which 
the KGB found hard to penetrate.^ ^ In 1976, when the StB 
discovered that Jozef Grohman, editor-in-chief of the state 
technical literature publishing house and the 
Czechoslovak representative at UNESCO, was working 
for West German intelligence, Obzina invited the Centre 



to send KGB officers to Prague to help in the 
investigation of the Grohman case at what he deferentially 
termed “a higher professional level. Sinitsyn concluded 
his annual report from Prague in 1977: 

Our friends hand over to us all their cipher traffic 
with the residencies, whether it is of an information 
nature or operational; they also hand over telegrams 
from ambassadors. Our friends keep practically no 
secrets from us.^^ 

The crushing of the Prague Spring and the 
“normalization” which followed marked a turning point in 
the KGB’s policy towards eastern Europe. The 
PROGRESS operations by illegals pioneered in 
Czechoslovakia were extended to the rest of eastern 
Europe to monitor the state of public opinion, penetrate 
subversive groups and watch for signs of “ideological 
sabotage” by Western intelligence agencies. From 1969 
onwards the KGB was also allowed to recruit agents and 
confidential contacts throughout the Soviet Bloc. In 
addition to the KGB liaison offices in the countries of the 
Warsaw Pact, the Centre now established, as in 
Czechoslovakia, secret residencies operating under 
diplomatic cover in Soviet embassies. 

In March 1968, partly as a result of the Prague Spring, 
there had been several weeks of confrontation between 
Warsaw students and the police, during which the aging 



Polish leader Wladislaw Gomulka had seemed in danger 
of losing control. Gomulka survived in the short term only 
because of his steadfast backing for intervention in 
Czechoslovakia and the Kremlin’s desire to avoid 
simultaneous upheavals in another part of the Soviet Bloc. 
His position, however, was already under threat from his 
eventual successor, Eduard Gierek. According to reports 
from the KGB liaison office in Warsaw, the hardline, anti- 
Semitic minister of the interior, Mieczyslaw Moczar, who 
was responsible for the SB (the Polish KGB), feared that 
his own position would also be threatened under Gierek 
and began plotting to prevent his succession. 
Compromising material on Gierek was passed, on 
Moczar’ s instructions, to Radio Free Europe via an SB 
agent. Moczar also ordered the bugging of a series of 
leading figures in the PUWP, the Polish Communist 
Party.^^ 

Late in 1970 Gomulka’ s position was fatally 
undermined by a new round of public protest. On 
December 14 workers at the Baltic shipyards of Gdansk, 
Gdynia and Szczecin struck in protest at a sudden rise in 
food prices. Clashes next day with security forces left 300 
strikers and demonstrators dead.^^ According to KGB 
reports from Warsaw, the order to open fire on the 
shipyard workers was given by Zenon Kliszko, 
Gomulka’ s closest supporter on the Politburo, and 
General Grzegorz Korczyhski, deputy defense minister 



and a supporter of Gierek.^^ The KGB also forwarded to 
Moscow the minutes of the Polish Politburo meeting held 
to discuss the crisis on December 19. With Gomulka in a 
Party clinic suffering from nervous exhaustion, the 
meeting was chaired by the prime minister, Jozef 
Cyrankiewicz, who asked the Minister of Defense, 
General Wojciech Jaruzelski, to report on the situation. 

Jaruzelski’s assessment sealed Gomulka’ s fate. He 
reported that 350 tanks and 600 troop carriers had been 
deployed in Gdansk and Gdynia alone. If unrest on a 
similar scale occurred in Warsaw, he could not guarantee 
the security of the capital, though special measures would 
be taken to protect Party and government buildings. Army 
morale was seriously affected. On the Baltic coast it was 
being met with shouts of “Gestapo!” and “Murderers!” 
Jaruzelski was followed by Moczar, who summarized SB 
and other reports reaching the interior ministry. The Party, 
he said, has never found itself so helpless in the face of a 
crisis. Hitherto, even when times were hardest. Party 
members had felt they were fighting for “a righteous 
cause” — ^but no longer. In Party meetings, when the 
Politburo letter justifying the price increases was read out, 
some Communists were reduced to tears and left the 
room. The rise in family allowances from 15 to 25 zlotys 
caused derision among rank and file members, stunned by 
the leadership’s incomprehension of ordinary living 
conditions. After an agitated debate it was agreed that 
Gomulka should be replaced as first secretary by Gierek. 



There was then an acrimonious discussion about who 
should tell Gomulka to submit his resignation, before it 
was finally decided to send Cyrankiewicz and the hitherto 
faithful Kliszko.^^ 

Gomulka’ s downfall marked the first occasion 
anywhere in Europe since the Second World War when 
spontaneous working-class protest had brought about a 
change of political leadership.^^ The Centre was 
predictably alarmed at the extent and success of the 
popular revolt and immediately embarked on a 
PROGRESS operation to assess how far it had been 
contained. A group of illegals, posing once again as 
Western visitors, were instructed to investigate the role of 
the Catholic Church in organizing protest, its attitude 
towards the Gierek regime and the general mood of the 
population. Among the illegals was the experienced 
Gennadi Blyablin (BOGUN), disguised as a West German 
press photographer, who was given a list of five 
individuals to cultivate and told to persuade two or three 
of them to “co-operate under false flag,” in the belief that 
they were supplying information not to the KGB but to 
West German wellwishers. Probably the most important 
name on the list was that of Father Andrzej Bardecki, 
personal assistant to Cardinal Archbishop Karol Wojtyla 
of Krakow, whom the Centre considered the leading 
ideological influence on the Polish Church. The KGB 
doubtless did not foresee that less than eight years later 



Wojtyla would become the first Polish pope, but it 
showed some foresight in identifying him as a potential 
threat to the Communist regime.^ ^ 

DURING 1971, IN addition to the illegals sent on 
PROGRESS operations to Czechoslovakia and Poland, 
thirteen were deployed in Romania, nine in Yugoslavia, 
seven in East Germany, four in Hungary and three in 
Bulgaria.^^ Though all had broadly similar objectives, 
there were also specific causes of KGB concern in each 
country. The priority given to Romania in 1971 
reflected growing Soviet displeasure at the foreign policy 
of its leader, Nicolae Ceau§escu, who combined a 
nepotistic version of neo- Stalinism at home with 
increasing independence from the Warsaw Pact abroad. 
After condemning the invasion of Czechoslovakia, 
Ceau§escu was rewarded in the following year by a state 
visit from Richard Nixon, the first by an American 
president to Communist eastern Europe. In 1970 
Ceau§escu paid the first of three visits to the United 
States. Moscow showed its displeasure at his visit to 
Beijing in 1971 by staging Warsaw Pact maneuvers on 
the Romanian borders.^^ 

KGB reports on Romania were written in a tone which 
combined indignation with deep suspicion: 


Exploiting the anti-Soviet line of the Chinese 



Communist Party and of the Chinese government, 
the Romanian leadership has set out on the path of 
so-called autonomy and independence from the 
Soviet Union ... Nationalism is flourishing in 
Romania. Its authors and advocates are the very 
same Party and government leaders. 

The Romanian Communist Party leadership does 
not openly reveal its territorial claims; but it does 
everything to demonstrate that historically, ethnically 
and in other ways Moldavia and the Chemovitsy 
Oblast belong to Romania. The statement made by 
Mao in conversation with Japanese socialists about 
the USSR’s illegal acquisition of Bessarabia 
[Moldavia] has been developed in Romania. 

The French newspaper Le Monde has twice 
published articles casting doubt on the legality of 
Bessarabia’s inclusion in the [Soviet] Union. It is not 
impossible that the initiative for publishing the 
articles came from Romania. 

The illegals sent to Romania under Western disguise in 
1971 were ordered to collect intelligence on Romanian 
relations with the United States and China; Romanian 
claims on Soviet territory in Bessarabia and north 
Bukovina; the political and economic basis of opposition 
to the Soviet Union; the position of German and 
Hungarian minorities; the Ceau§escu cult; and the state of 
the Romanian Communist Party. The illegals’ main 



sources included staff of the Party newspaper Scintea and 
the German language Volk und Kultur.^^ 

PROGRESS OPERATIONS IN Yugoslavia during 1971 
were prompted chiefly by the most serious internal crisis 
since Tito’s break with Moscow in 1948. The dramatic 
resurgence of nationalist tensions during the Croat Spring 
of 1971 culminated at the end of the year with Tito’s 
arrest of the Croat Communist leaders and 400 Croat 
nationalists and in his resumption of direct control over 
the Croat secret police. The claim that Yugoslav socialism 
was resolving ethnic rivalries was exposed as an illusion. 

The illegals were given a long list of institutions in 
which they were instructed to “strike up acquaintances:” 
the Academy of Sciences, the Public Opinion Institute in 
Belgrade, the editorial offices of Kommunist, Politika and 
Borba, the Tanjug Agency, the Institute for International 
Politics and Economics at Belgrade University, Zagreb 
University, Yugoslav businesses and the Union of 
Journalists (in particular, the writer Dobrica Cosic, who 
was believed to be close to Tito). Some of the reports sent 
back to the Centre by illegal courier, radio and the post 
were judged sufficiently important to be forwarded to 
Brezhnev. 


BY FAR THE largest KGB presence in eastern Europe 
was in East Germany. Ever since the Second World War 



there had been a large KGB enclave within the 
headquarters of the Soviet military administration in the 
Berlin suburb of Karlshorst. During the period which 
preceded the establishment of the GDR it had closely 
monitored political parties, churches, trade unions and 
public opinion within the Soviet zone of Germany. 
Though the KGB claimed after the foundation of the 
GDR that the role of its Karlshorst base was to mount 
operations against the FRG and other Western countries, 
as well as to provide liaison with the Stasi, it also 
continued to monitor developments within East 
Germany.^^ In 1971 the intelligence personnel stationed 
at Karlshorst, not including liaison officers, totaled 404, 
of whom fortyeight were operations officers working 
under cover. Another forty-seven KGB operations 
officers were stationed elsewhere in the GDR.^^ 

The advent of Willy Brandt’s socialist-liberal coalition 
in West Germany in 1969 offered opportunities for 
detente which Moscow was more anxious to pursue than 
Walter Ulbricht, the aging and inflexible neo- Stalinist 
leader of East Germany. KGB reports from Karlshorst 
complained that, after the invasion of Czechoslovakia, 
Ulbricht was posing as the wisest and most far-sighted 
statesman of the Soviet Bloc, implying (probably 
correctly) that he had been quicker than Brezhnev to 
identify the subversive nature of the Dubcek regime. 
Ulbricht’ s refusal to abandon his commitment to a united 



“socialist” Germany made him unwilling to consider an 
agreement with Brandt involving, for the first time, 
mutual recognition by the FRG and the GDR.^^ 

By 1969, if not before, both Willi Stoph, the East 
German prime minister, and Erich Honecker, who had 
overseen the building of the Berlin Wall, were fueling 
Moscow’s growing irritation with Ulbricht at meetings 
with the KGB and the Soviet ambassador, Pyotr 
Andreyevich Abrasimov. Ulbricht, they reported, had 
described Soviet cut-price imports of East German 
uranium as “the plundering of the GDR’s natural 
resources.” When Abrasimov suggested that allowance 
needed to be made for Ulbricht’ s age (he was seventy-six 
in 1969), Stoph and Honecker retorted that he should have 
resigned when he was seventy. In 1971 Ulbricht was 
kicked upstairs to the newly created post of Party 
chairman, and succeeded as Party leader by Honecker. In 
the following year the GDR and FRG formally recognized 
each other’s existence as separate states. 

Though bickering continued within the Party 
leadership, the KGB’s main concern was “the impact of 
the adversary’s ideology on citizens of the GDR” through 
Western broadcasts and visits by West Germans. The 
Centre calculated in the mid-1970s that “500,000 citizens 
are hostile to the existing system and the [Western] 
adversary will for a long time retain a base of support in 
the GDR.”^^ A long-running KGB operation, codenamed 



LUCH, monitored opinion within the East German 
population and Party, contacts between East and West 
Germans and alleged “attempts by the USA and the ERG 
to harm the building of socialism” in the GDR. In 1974 
the section of the Karlshorst KGB responsible for LUCH 
was raised in status to a directorate.^^ 

The majority of the Centre’s intelligence on East 
Germany, however, came from the Stasi, whose network 
of internal informers was vastly greater than the KGB’s. 
The GDR had seven times as many informers per head of 
population as Nazi Germany. In 1975 65 percent of all 
reports from Soviet Bloc security services received by the 
Centre came from the Stasi. Some of the reports were, 
in effect, classified East German opinion polls. In an 
opinion survey of factory workers in 1974, for example, 
20.6 percent of those questioned “considered that 
friendship with the USSR restricted the GDR’s autonomy 
and brought more benefit to the Soviet Union than to the 
GDR.” A majority, when asked to explain the phrase 
“achieving working-class power,” claimed not to know 
what it meant. Some of the comments on the phrase, 
however, were described in the report forwarded to the 
Centre as “bitter, wounding and vicious.” Among them 
were “Working-class power is all right [in theory], but 
what is it like in practice?”; “This is just a slogan!”; and 
“Justice for every worker, not just for a newly created 
privileged group!” Given the inevitable caution of those 



questioned in expressing politically incorrect views, the 
real level of dissatisfaction was probably considerably 
higher. Both the size of the KGB’s Karlshorst base and 
the volume of intelligence from the Stasi made the Centre 
less dependent on PROGRESS operations by illegals for 
intelligence from East Germany than from the rest of 
eastern Europe. 

THE KGB’S MAIN concern in Hungary was the extent of 
Jewish influence within the Party and the AVH (the 
Hungarian KGB). Always prone to Zionist and anti- 
Semitic conspiracy theories, the Centre was deeply 
disturbed by Hungarian reluctance to agree in 1969 to its 
suggestion for holding “an anti-Zionist conference in 
Budapest of progressive Jews opposed to the policy of 
Israel” or for assisting the KGB in making an anti-Zionist 
film alleging cooperation between Hitler and Hungarian 
Zionists. “The Hungarian security agencies,” the Centre 
concluded, “were forced to look over their shoulder when 
working on the [anti-]Zionist line, as Jewish nationalists 
within the leadership of the highest Party organs were 
morbidly cautious with regard to this sector of work.” The 
KGB also looked askance at the number of Jews within 
the Hungarian interior ministry, among them — it reported 
— two deputy ministers, the heads of the AVH First and 
Third Directorates (responsible, respectively, for foreign 
intelligence and the surveillance of domestic political 
opposition), the head of the police directorate and the 



head of military counter-intelligence. The situation was 
worst of all in foreign intelligence, where, according to 
KGB calculations, thirteen of the seventeen department 
chiefs were Jewish.^^ 

The illegals sent to Hungary on PROGRESS operations 
in 1971 posing as Western visitors were sent primarily to 
investigate the extent of Zionist influence. They were 
instructed to report on attitudes to Israel and its trade and 
economic relations with Hungary, “the links of Hungarian 
organizations and individuals with Zionist circles” and the 
situation in the Writers’ Union and other “creative 
unions” (where Jewish influence was also believed to be 
strong). The illegals were also told to “identify anti- 
Semitic attitudes,” presumably in the hope that they 
would discover popular opposition to the number of 
Hungarian Jews in high places. According to an alarmist 
Centre assessment, “Pro-Zionist domination was 
entrenched in Party, state and public organizations.”^^ 

DURING 1972 PROGRESS operations were extended to 
areas of nationalist unrest within the Soviet Union. On 
October 4, 1972 KGB Directive No. 150/3-10807 
instructed the FCD Illegals Directorate to investigate the 
mood of the population and the activities of Western 
tourists in the Baltic republics. The Centre’s analysis of 
the reports received from ARTYOM, FYODOROV, 
SEVIDOV and VLAS was uniformly depressing. Posing 
as Western visitors, all four illegals noted inefficient 



administration; an apathetic workforce “just sitting out the 
appointed [working] hours, with no pride in their 
profession;” intolerance between ethnic groups; and 
widespread drunkenness. The population of the Baltic 
republics were, however, “well informed about events in 
the West and in the Soviet Union.” Letters were taken to 
the West by foreign tourists, frequently written by people 
anxious to enter into marriages of convenience with 
Westerners to provide pretexts for emigration: “Many 
people of either sex marry ethnic Jews, although they 
themselves are not Jews; their only aim is to leave the 
USSR.” As frequently occurred with analyses of internal 
dissidence, the main scapegoats were the Jews. Because 
they were “conscious of the moral support of Israel and 
the USA and other Western countries,” they were alleged 
to be even more idle than the rest of the population — 
admitting to the illegals that “We work just enough to 
avoid being sacked. 

ALL OVER EASTERN Europe the illegals appear to 
have given franker, and therefore more depressing, 
assessments of public attitudes than the KGB liaison 
offices and residencies, who were under pressure to 
produce flattering accounts of local reaction to dreary set- 
piece speeches by Soviet leaders. Even in Bulgaria most 
of the population had lost their traditional sense of Slav 
kinship with Soviet Russia. According to one report: 



Anti-Sovietism flourishes on Bulgarian television. 
Though not openly expressed ... it finds a fertile 
breeding ground. The so-called “spots,” featuring 
Soviet films about the Soviet Union and Soviet life, 
cause the population to switch off their television 
sets.^^ 

When the illegal TANOV was sent on a two-month 
PROGRESS mission to Bulgaria in 1974, posing as a 
Western journalist preparing travel brochures, he was 
advised by the Centre to win the confidence of the 
Bulgarians he talked to by giving them presents. 
Everywhere he went he found resentment at the low 
standard of living and the well-founded conviction that 
Bulgaria was being pressurized by the Soviet Union to 
squander resources on Cuba and other profligate foreign 
friends, as well as on a huge police and state security 
system. From the Centre’s viewpoint, the only silver 
lining in TANOV’ s bleak report was that Bulgarians were 
too afraid of the DS, their security service, to grumble 
publicly. 

PROBABLY THE MOST depressing intelligence on the 
Soviet Bloc to reach the Centre during the 1970s came 
from Czechoslovakia. An illegal reported after a 
PROGRESS mission in 1976: 


The population of the country hates the Russians. 



The Czechs cannot even make an objective judgment 
of the skills of Soviet artists performing on tour in 
Czechoslovakia. The following is a typical comment: 
“It may be that the artists are performing well 
professionally, but because they are Russians I can’t 
bear to watch them.”^^ 

Lines in plays which were capable of being interpreted as 
“negative allusions” to the Soviet Union, such as “Love 
for the enemy is not love” in Gorin’s Till Eulenspiegel, 
were liable to provoke storms of applause from the 
audience. 

In view of the popular rejoicings after the 
Czechoslovak defeat of the Russian team in the 1969 
World Ice Hockey Championships in Stockholm, there 
was considerable anxiety before the 1979 world 
championships which were held in Prague. A special 
commission headed by one of the leading internationalists 
on the CPCz Presidium, Antonin Kapek, tried to ensure 
good crowd behavior by introducing a variety of security 
measures, arranging for ticket allocations to Party 
organizations and conducting what was called 
“educational work” among both players and spectators. 
Most of its efforts proved in vain. 

Throughout the championships, which opened at the 
end of April, Brezhnev received regular reports from both 
the KGB and the Soviet embassy in Prague. They made 
dismal reading. Irrespective of who the Russian team was 



playing, the Czechoslovak spectators cheered the other 
side and shouted anti-Soviet insults. The United States, 
Canadian and West German teams, by contrast, all 
received a warm reception. The KGB reported that the 
Soviet defeat of the Czechoslovak team was “greeted 
coldly” even by Strougal and other ministers in the 
government box. After the match senior CPCz officials 
avoided members of the Soviet embassy. 

The KGB did, however, succeed in preventing one 
potentially acute embarrassment. After the Soviet match 
against East Germany, a Russian player who had taken 
proscribed stimulants was summoned to a drug test. Had 
he failed the test, as no doubt he would have done, the 
Soviet victory might have been annulled. The KGB 
reported proudly to Brezhnev that, “as a result of 
measures taken by the [Prague] residency,” the player 
concerned was let off the drug test.^^ 

KGB reports from Prague complained that, after the 
Soviet team won the world championship, the medal 
ceremony was conducted in English and German with no 
Russian translation. At the gala reception which followed, 
the Russians were coldshouldered. The Soviet flag was 
ripped from the team. Even the CPCz newspaper Rude 
prdvo paid more attention to the Canadian, Swedish and 
Finnish teams than to the Soviet world champions. 

The KGB was also outraged at the sometimes visible 
lack of enthusiasm displayed by Czechoslovak 
representatives at tedious official celebrations in the 



Soviet Union. The Centre wrote a damning report on the 
behavior of Miroslav Vasek, head of a delegation from 
the Czechoslovak ministry of culture at the Ninth 
Conference of Ministers of Culture of the Socialist 
Countries, held in Moscow in July 1978. At the end of 
this doubtless mind-numbing occasion, Vasek had had the 
impertinence to leave behind in his room at the Hotel Mir 
both the souvenir conference folder and a series of 
probably unreadable volumes solemnly presented to him 
by the Soviet ministry of culture: Lenin: Revolution and 
Art, Brezhnev: A Brief Biography, Sixty Jubilee Years: 
Facts and Figures about the Achievements of Culture and 
Art in the Soviet Union and Protection of Historical and 
Cultural Monuments in the USSR. The KGB report 
insisted that these valuable items had been deliberately 
“abandoned, not simply forgotten.” The Centre was not 
prepared for this outrage to be passed over. A full report 
on it was sent both to Andropov and to the KGB liaison 
office in Prague. 

For all the KGB’s dissatisfaction with the state of 
Czechoslovak public opinion and the fractious leadership 
of the CPCz, the Communist one-party state in 
Czechoslovakia was under no visible threat at the end of 
the 1970s. At the beginning of 1977 a series of small 
dissident groups came together in “Charter 77,” which 
described itself as “a free, informal, open community of 
people of different convictions, different faiths and 
different professions, united by the will to strive. 



individually and collectively, for the respect of civil and 
human rights.” Within six months, over 750 courageous 
individuals had signed the Charter. All endured public 
vilification and persecution, ranging from attacks on the 
street to prison sentences and incarceration in psychiatric 
hospitals. One of the founders, the philosopher Jan 
Patocka, died after a brutal interrogation by the StB. The 
power of the StB, the sense of powerlessness induced in 
the mass of the population by the process of 
“normalization” and the presence of Soviet troops robbed 
Charter 77 of any chance of recapturing the mass 
enthusiasm generated by the promise nine years earlier of 
“socialism with a human face.”^^ 

Throughout the Soviet Bloc the KGB’s east European 
clones, urged on by the Centre, were among the moving 
forces during the decade which followed the Prague 
Spring in the creation of an intellectually monotone and 
moribund society. Vaclav Havel, one of the founders of 
Charter 77 (and later the first president of the post- 
Communist Czech Republic), wrote later of this period: 

I remember the first half of the 1970s in 
Czechoslovakia as the time when “history stopped” 

... History has been replaced by pseudo-history, with 
its calendar of regularly returning official 
anniversaries. Party congresses, festivities and mass 
sport meetings ... Totalitarian power has brought 
“order” in the organic “disorder” of history, thereby 



numbing it as history. The government, as it were, 
nationalized time. Hence, time meets with the sad 
fate of so many other nationalized things: it has 
begun to wither away.^^ 

The clock which had stopped in eastern Europe with the 
suppression of the Prague Spring in 1968 was to start 
again ten years later with the election of a Polish pope. 



SEVENTEEN 


THE KGB AND WESTERN 
COMMUNIST PARTIES 


The KGB and Western Communist Parties Throughout 
the Cold War, Communist parties around the world 
dismissed claims that they were involved in Soviet 
espionage as crude McCarthyite slander. KGB files, 
however, give the lie to most of their denials. From the 
1920s onwards Western Communists were regularly 
asked for help in intelligence operations, which they 
usually considered their fraternal duty to provide. Most 
leaders of even the largest Western parties equally 
considered it the fraternal duty of the Communist Party of 
the Soviet Union (CPSU) to provide, via the KGB, annual 
subsidies whose existence they indignantly denied. 
Knowledge of the KGB connection in the fields of both 
espionage and finance was the preserve of small and 
secretive inner circles within each Party leadership. 

In the immediate aftermath of the Second World War, 
the most active assistance in Soviet agent recruitment 
came from four Communist Parties which were briefly 



included in coalition governments: the French Parti 
Communiste Fran^ais (PCF), the Italian Partito 
Comunista Italiano (PCI), the Austrian Kommunistische 
Partei Osterreichs (KPO) and the Finnish Suomen 
Kommunistinen Puolue (SKP). 

AS SHOWN IN chapter 9, the PCF assisted after the 
Liberation in a major penetration of the French 
intelligence community which continued for at least a 
quarter of a century. From July 1, 1946 to June 30, 1947 
the Paris residency forwarded to the Centre a total of 
1,289 French intelligence documents.^ By the early 1950s 
the KGB’s chief collaborator inside the PCF was Gaston 
Plissonnier (codenamed LANG), a life-long Soviet 
loyalist who had established himself by 1970 as second- 
in-command to the Party leader.^ Though little known to 
the French public and a poor public speaker with a thick 
regional accent, Plissonnier was a master in the arcane 
procedures of “democratic centralism” by which the Party 
leadership imposed its policies on its members.^ As well 
as providing inside information on the PCF, he assisted 
the KGB in identifying potential agents and other 
intelligence operations.^ During the later 1970s 
Plissonnier also passed on reports from an agent in the 
entourage of President Boumedienne of Algeria.^ 


IN ITALY, AS in France, Communist ministers sat in 



post-war coalition governments until the spring of 1947. 
At the end of 1945 the PCI had 1,760,000 members — 
twice as many as the PCF. All over Italy, photographs of 
Stalin, affectionately known as Baffone (“Walrus 
moustache”), were pasted on factory walls and stuck to 
machinery. “We were all under the impression,” one of 
the Communist ministers, Fausto Gallo, later 
acknowledged, “that the wind was blowing our way.”^ 
Washington feared that Gallo and his colleagues might be 
right. The National Security Council concluded in 
November 1947, “The Italian Government, ideologically 
inclined towards Western democracy, is weak and is 
being subjected to continuous attack by a strong 
Communist Party.” The very first CIA covert action was 
an operation to aid the Christian Democrats against the 
Communists in the 1948 general election by laundering 
over 10 million dollars from captured Axis funds for use 
in the campaign.^ 

As in France, the post-war popularity of the 
Communist Party and the brief period of Communist 
participation in government created the best opportunities 
Soviet intelligence was ever to enjoy in Italy for agent 
penetration. Like JOUR, probably the most important of 
the post-war French recruits, DARIO, the longest-serving 
and probably the most valuable Italian agent, was a 
foreign ministry employee. Bom in 1908, and trained as a 
lawyer, DARIO worked as a journalist and state official in 
agriculture during the early years of fascist Italy. In 1932 



he was recruited as a Soviet agent on an “ideological 
basis” but, on instructions from his controller, pretended 
to be a supporter of Mussolini and in 1937 succeeded in 
enrolling in the Fascist Party. Before the outbreak of war 
he obtained a job in the foreign ministry, ironically 
dealing with Soviet and Comintern affairs and succeeded 
in recruiting three foreign ministry typists (codenamed 
DARYA, ANNA and MARTA) who regularly supplied 
him with what the Centre considered “valuable” classified 
documents. For almost forty years DARIO was 
instrumental in obtaining a phenomenal amount of 
classified foreign ministry material.^ His remarkable 
career as a Soviet agent, however, was temporarily 
interrupted during the war. In 1942, following the 
discovery by the Italian police of an illegal GRU 
residency with which DARIO was in contact, he was 
arrested and imprisoned, surviving a period at the end of 
the war in a German concentration camp from which he 
was liberated by the Red Army.^ 

Once back in Italy, DARIO reestablished contact with 
DARYA and MARTA, both of whom agreed once again 
to give him foreign ministry documents. Probably on 
Soviet instructions, instead of joining the PCI he became 
a member of the Italian Socialist Party led by Pietro 
Nenni, but was expelled in 1946 after he was denounced 
as a former fascist and threatened with prosecution. At the 
request of the Rome residency, the Communist leader, 
Palmiro Togliatti, secretly interceded with Nenni and 



DARIO was given back his Socialist Party membership. 
Togliatti’s intervention, however, leaked out and DARIO 
was publicly identified as having links with the Soviet 
embassy. He succeeded, none the less, in recruiting two 
more foreign ministry typists: TOPO (later renamed 
LEDA), who for fifteen years provided what the Centre 
considered “valuable documents,” and NIKOL (later 
INGA), who also supplied “consistently valuable” 
information. Probably soon after her recruitment under a 
false flag (not identified in Mitrokhin’s notes), TOPO and 
DARIO were married. In March 1975, forty-three years 
after DARIO ’s recruitment, he and his wife were awarded 
the Order of the Red Star. He finally retired in May 1979 
after one of the longest careers as a Soviet agent in the 
history of the FCD.^^ 

In the immediate aftermath of the Second World War 
the Rome residency also achieved a highly successful 
penetration of the interior ministry, thanks chiefly to a 
Communist civil servant, codenamed DEMID, who acted 
as agent-recruiter. On instructions from the residency, 
DEMID left the Communist Party immediately after his 
recruitment in 1944. His first major cultivation inside the 
ministry was QUESTOR, whom he helped to obtain a job 
in the cipher department. By 1955 the penetration of the 
Italian interior ministry, begun by DEMID, was 
considered so important that control of it was handed over 
to a newly established illegal residency in Rome, headed 
by Ashot Abgarovch Akopyan, a 40-year-old Armenian 



from Baku codenamed YEFRAT.^^ 

THE THIRD STATE in which Soviet agent penetration 
was assisted by Communist participation in post-war 
coalition governments was Austria. Though placed under 
joint occupation until 1955 by the Soviet Union, United 
States, Britain and France (a cumbersome arrangement 
likened by Karl Renner, the first post-war chancellor, to 
“four elephants in a rowing boat”), Austria — ^unlike 
Germany — was allowed to govern itself. In Renner’s 
provisional government, formed in April 1945, the 
Communists were given three ministries, including the 
key post of Minister of the Interior taken by Franz 
Honner. In the November 1945 elections, however, the 
Austrian Communist Party (KPO), which had expected to 
do as well as the French PCF, picked up a mere 5 percent 
of the vote and was given only the comparatively 
unimportant ministry of electrification in the new 
coalition. The KPO left government altogether two years 
later, and its two half-hearted attempts to stage a coup d 
'etat in 1947 and 1950 failed to gain serious Soviet 
support. 

Franz Honner used his seven months in 1945 to pack 
the Austrian federal police force (Bundespolizei) with 
Communist Party members. Though many were purged or 
sidelined by Honner’ s socialist successor, Oskar 
Helmer,^^ Soviet penetration of the Austrian police. 



especially its security service (Staatspolizei or Stapo), 
continued until the 1980s. In an attempt to evade 
Helmer’s purge, Communists in the police force were 
instructed to disavow or conceal their Party 
membership. The files noted by Mitrokhin record the 
recruitment of a series of major KGB police agents: 
EDUARD in 1945, VENTSEYEV in 1946,^^ PETER in 
1952,^^ two further recruits in 1955, ZAK in 1974^^ and 
NADEZHDIN in 1978.^^ There may well have been 
others; Mitrokhin’ s list is probably not exhaustive. At 
least some of them took part in operations (one of them 
codenamed EDELWEISS) to remove and copy top secret 
documents held in the safe of the head of the Stapo. In 
1973 Andropov personally authorized the payment to one 
of its Stapo agents of a reward of 30,000 Austrian 
schillings.^ ^ 

IN THREE OF the four countries of Scandinavia — 
Denmark, Norway and Finland — Communist ministers 
also served in post-war coalitions. By far the most 
influential of the Scandinavian Communist parties was 
the Finnish SKP.^^ Alone among Germany’s eastern 
allies, Finland was not forced to become part of the Soviet 
Bloc. At the end of the Second World War, however, 
Stalin still kept his options open. In 1945, at Soviet 
insistence, the SKP was given several key positions 
within the Finnish government, secretly instructed via a 



“special channel” on their relations with “bourgeois 
parties,” and held in readiness for a possible coup d'etat. 
That Finland was not in the end forced to become a 
people’s democracy was probably due chiefly to 
memories of the Winter War in 1939-40, when the greatly 
outnumbered Finns had inflicted heavy casualties on the 
Soviet invaders. Stalin was well aware that the price of 
Finnish incorporation in the Soviet Bloc might be another 
blood bath.^^ Finland was, however, deprived of 12 
percent of its territory, forced to pay enormous reparations 
(five times those of Italy) and required to sign a non- 
aggression pact in 1948. 

In Finland, as in Austria, the Communists succeeded in 
1945 in claiming the key post of minister of the interior. 
But whereas the Austrian Communist Franz Honner left 
office after only seven months, his Finnish counterpart, 
Yrji Leino, continued in power for three years. Leino’s 
aim, like Honner’ s, was “to deprive the bourgeoisie of 
one of its most important weapons in supporting 
reactionary policies, the police force.” By the end of 1945 
the security police had been purged and reconstituted as a 
new force, usually known as Valpo. As Leino later 
acknowledged, “the new recruits were naturally, as far as 
possible. Communists. The rapidity of the purges and 
the inexperience of the new recruits, however, led to a 
good deal of confusion. According to Leino, “Valpo in 
SKP hands never became the kind of weapon that had 
been hoped for ... They did not have the skill to use it to 



advantage in the right way.” Leino himself found it 
increasingly difficult to cope. By 1947 he was drinking 
heavily and sometimes absent from his office for days on 
end. At the end of the year he was summoned to Moscow, 
given a severe dressing down by two senior members of 
the Politburo, instructed to resign from the Finnish 
government and told to go for a health cure in the Soviet 
Union. Though Leino refused to tender his resignation, he 
was dismissed by President Paasikivi in April 1948 on the 
grounds that he no longer enjoyed the confidence of 
Parliament. His dismissal brought to an end Communist 
participation in the Finnish government. Leino ’s 
memoirs, completed ten years later, caused such 
embarrassment in Moscow that, at the insistence of the 
Soviet ambassador in Helsinki, the whole edition was 
destroyed on the eve of publication, leaving only a few 
copies in private circulation.^^ 

THE REMOVAL FROM power by 1948 of all those 
Western Communist parties which had taken part in post- 
war coalitions reduced, but did not end, their ability to 
assist Soviet intelligence penetration of government 
bureaucracies. By far the biggest disappointment 
experienced by the Centre at the beginning of the Cold 
War in its relations with fraternal parties in the West, 
however, was the dramatic decline in the assistance 
offered by the Communist Party of the United States 
(CPUS A). From the mid- 1930s to the onset of the Cold 



War, Communism had been a major force in the 
American labor movement, a significant influence on the 
liberal wing of the Democratic Party and a rite of passage 
for several hundred thousand young radicals. During the 
Second World War the Party had played an important part 
in assisting Soviet penetration of the Roosevelt 
administration, the MANHATTAN project and the 
intelligence community. The onset of the Cold War, 
however, dealt the CPUS A a blow from which it never 
fiilly recovered. 

In 1949 Gene Dennis, the general secretary, and ten 
other Party leaders were put on trial for advocating the 
forcible overthrow of the federal government. Dennis and 
nine of the defendants were sentenced to five years in jail, 
the eleventh was jailed for three years and all the defense 
attorneys were found in contempt of court. After the 
Supreme Court upheld the sentences in 1951, more than a 
hundred other leading Communists were convicted on 
similar charges. For most of the 1950s the Party was 
forced into a largely underground existence. It was deeply 
ironic that when McCarthyism was at its height the 
CPUS A was among those Western parties which were 
least able to give assistance to Soviet espionage. Not till 
the Supreme Court backed away from its earlier decision 
in 1957 was the CPUS A able to regroup. By the time the 
Party had drawn up a new membership list in 1958, there 
were only 3,000 open members and a much smaller 
number of undeclared members left.^^ 



What the CPUS A might have achieved during the 
1950s had it been less persecuted was well illustrated by 
the neighboring Canadian Party, which in 1951-3 assisted 
the Ottawa residency in the recruitment of Hugh 
Hambleton, probably the most important Canadian agent 
of the Cold War, and ten other agents. Like most other 
Western parties, the Canadian Communist Party also 
provided help in documenting illegals — among them 
Konon Trofimovich Molody (codenamed BEN), the most 
celebrated of the Cold War illegal residents in Britain. 

In 1957, with the help of the Canadian Communist Party, 
the Ottawa residency succeeded in obtaining a new 
passport for the illegal resident in the United States, 
“Willie” Fisher (better known as “Rudolf Abel”) in the 
name of Robert Callan, bom on March 10, 1903 in Fort 
William, Ontario. “Abel,” however, was arrested before 
he could adopt his new identity. The Ottawa residency 
was subsequently fearful that the clerk who issued the 
passport might recognize the photograph of “Abel” 
published in the press after his arrest in June 1957 as that 
of “Robert Callan.” Unsurprisingly, the clerk, who 
doubtless saw — and paid little attention to — many 
photographs a day, seems not to have noticed.^ ^ 

One of the rare cases in which the assistance given by 
Western Communists in fabricating the legend of a Soviet 
illegal became public was that of Reino Hayhanen 
(codenamed VIK), who was helped to adopt the identity 



of the Finn Eugene Maki by the Finnish Communist Olavi 
Ahman (codenamed VIRTANEN). When Hayhanen 
defected to the FBI in 1957, Ahman and his wife were 
secretly taken into hiding in the Soviet Union. For almost 
twenty years Ahman pleaded to go back to Finland, but 
the Finnish Communist Party insisted that he stay in 
Russia for fear that his return would expose it to “anti- 
communist propaganda.” In 1975 the Party leader, Ville 
Pessi (codenamed BARANOV), finally relented. Ahman 
was allowed back home and awarded a KGB pension of 
200 roubles a month. 

A number of Western Communist parties were also 
asked to provide various kinds of assistance to KGB 
illegals. In 1957 a group of undeclared members of the 
French Communist Party, recommended by the PCF 
leadership, began training as radio operators for illegal 
residencies. Initially the new recruits found difficulty in 
transcribing the coded number groups broadcast in test 
transmissions from the Centre. By the end of the year, 
however, some had successfully completed their training 
course.^^ 

The files seen by Mitrokhin give no sense that the 
Centre’s demands on the fraternal assistance of Western 
Communist parties declined in the course of the Cold 
War. On the contrary, the KGB’s solicitations of its 
“friends” appear to have been greater during the 1970s 
than in the previous decade. The increased deployment of 
experienced illegals in eastern Europe after the Prague 



spring and the difficulty experienced by the FCD in 
finding enough suitably qualified and well-motivated 
Soviet replacements led it to seek renewed inspiration 
from the era of the Great Illegals, some of the greatest of 
whom — the Austrian Arnold Deutsch and the German 
Richard Sorge chief among them — had been Communists 
from other European countries. Deutsch’ s career, 
however, still remained top secret, not least because two 
of his most important recruits, Anthony Blunt and John 
Caimcross, were still at liberty in the West. Sorge, by 
contrast, was the best-publicized member of the Soviet 
intelligence pantheon, he had been posthumously declared 
Hero of the Soviet Union in 1964 and further honored by 
the first postage stamps ever issued to commemorate a 
spy. Sorge ’s reputation as a romantic heart-throb added to 
his popular appeal. His was the example chosen by the 
Centre to inspire a new generation of non- Soviet KGB 
illegals. 

The recruitment campaign began on the eve of the 
Twenty-fourth Congress of the Soviet Communist Party 
(CPSU) in April 1971. The FCD took advantage of the 
presence in Moscow of a large number of leaders of 
fraternal parties in the West to ask some of them to search 
out a new generation of Sorges. The files noted by 
Mitrokhin record meetings between senior FCD officers 
and six different Western Communist leaders to discuss 
the recruitment of illegals. There may well have been 
many more such approaches. 



Shortly before the Party congress opened, the former 
resident in Copenhagen, Leonid Sergeyevich Zaitsev, met 
Knud Jespersen, the chairman of the Danish Communist 
Party, at the Sovetskaya Hotel, and asked him to find 
“two or three” totally reliable, dedicated Communists, 
loyal to the Soviet Union, who could be trained to become 
“Danish Richard Sorges.” They should be male, between 
twenty and forty years of age, and preferably undeclared 
rather than open Party members. If married, their wives 
would have to meet the same conditions. Potential Danish 
Sorges would also need to be well educated and in a 
suitable occupation — such as journalist, businessman or 
foreign language student. According to Zaitsev, Jespersen 
responded enthusiastically, saying that he fully 
understood both the importance and the secrecy of the 
request, and already had one candidate in mind, whose 
details he would send to the current resident in 
Copenhagen, Anatoli Aleksandrovich Danilov.^^ 

Meanwhile at the Ukraina Hotel, I. P. Kisliak, a former 
operations officer at the Athens residency, was asking 
Kostas Koliannis, first secretary of the Greek Communist 
Party, to find “one or two” Greek Richard Sorges. Like 
Zaitsev, Kisliak emphasized that candidates must be 
“totally reliable ideologically,” but added that they also 
needed “charm.”^^ At a subsequent meeting with Ezekias 
Papaioannou, general secretary of AKEL (the Cyprus 
Communist Party), Kisliak was slightly less demanding. 
Though Cypriot candidates would require high moral. 



political and professional qualities, they need not 
necessarily be “the equals of Richard Sorge.”^^ 

While Zaitsev and Kisliak were approaching the heads 
of the Danish, Greek and Cypriot Parties, Anatoli 
Ivanovich Lazarev, head of the FCD Illegals Directorate, 
was engaged in talks with Gaston Plissonnier, the second- 
in-command of the French Communist Party. Plissonier 
agreed to select two or three undeclared members of the 
PCF with the potential to become French Sorges and later 
suggested two possible candidates. He was also asked to 
supply the KGB with the names of poorly paid (and, by 
implication, corruptible) staff in the French foreign 
ministry whose work included photocopying classified 
documents. 

One of the FCD’s approaches to a leading member of a 
fraternal delegation to the Twenty-fourth Party Congress 
took place in hospital. Geinrich Fritz of the Austrian 
Communist Party (KP6) Central Committee suffered an 
acute attack of sciatica shortly before the congress opened 
and was taken for treatment to the CPSU Central 
Committee Polyclinic at Kuntsevo. While undergoing 
treatment in Ward 103, he was visited by Ivan 
Alekseyevich Yerofeyev, deputy head of the Fourth 
(German and Austrian) Department, who raised the 
question of finding “one or two” Austrian Sorges. Fritz 
said that the KP6 chairman, Franz Muhri, refused to 
become involved in intelligence matters because of his 
precarious position within the Party. However, Fritz 



agreed to find suitable candidates himself and to keep N. 
V. Kirilenko, head of Line PR at the Vienna residency, 
informed of his progress. 

The most cautious of the Party leaders whose responses 
to the 1971 illegal recruiting drive were noted by 
Mitrokhin was the general secretary of the Communist 
Party of Canada (CPC), William Kashtan. Though a 
rigidly orthodox pro- Soviet loyalist, Kashtan “made much 
of the practical difficulties.” The CPC had to be 
particularly careful to avoid any suspicion of involvement 
with the KGB, he explained, because of memories of the 
Gouzenko affair in 1945, when the Party’s only MP, Fred 
Rose, and its national organizer, Sam Carr, had both been 
exposed as Soviet agents. Kashtan was assured that he 
was expected only to select reliable candidates, provide 
character references and suggest ways of making contact 
with them. The KGB would do the rest and ensure that, 
even in the event of “complications,” he would not 
become involved. Kashtan is said to have replied that this 
arrangement “suited him completely.” 

During the Twenty- fourth Party Congress senior FCD 
officers also held discussions with at least eight leaders of 
Latin American Communist parties. The aim was not as 
yet to solicit a new generation of Latin American Sorges, 
but rather to identify potential agents in registry offices 
who could supply the documents required to support 
illegals’ legends. Within a year or so, however, the 



Centre was actively seeking Latin illegals to operate in 
North America.^^ In 1975 Kryuchkov personally 
approached the general secretary of the Argentinian 
Communist Party, Alvarez Amedo, to “seek help from 
our Argentinian friends in building up the illegal agent 
apparatus of Soviet intelligence.” According to the KGB 
record of the conversation, Amedo was “wholly 
sympathetic.”^^ During 1975 Andropov also gave 
personal instmctions for approaches to Communist Party 
leaders in Syria, Iraq and Lebanon as part of a quest for 
Arab illegals. 

OVER A QUARTER of a century after the collapse of the 
post-war coalitions which had given Communists a brief 
experience of office in France, Italy, Austria and 
Scandinavia, Communist ministers once again entered a 
Western government. They did so as a result of the 
Portuguese Revolution of April 1974, when the so-called 
Armed Forces Movement of young, radical officers ended 
over forty years of civilian dictatorship and promised both 
to restore democracy and to end Portugal’s colonial wars 
in Africa. Within days the Communist and Socialist 

r 

leaders, Alvaro Cunhal and Mario Soares, had returned 
from exile, standing together in front of their delirious 
supporters jointly clutching the same red carnation. 
Soares paid tribute to Cunhal, his former teacher, as “a 
remarkable man, with a luminous, penetrating glance that 



bespoke great inner strength. But Cunhal was also a 
hardline Soviet loyalist who in 1968 had been the first 
Western Communist leader to support the crushing of the 
Prague Spring. Though the differences between himself 
and Soares gradually widened, they were to serve together 
in a series of coalition governments until the summer of 
1975. 

In June 1974 Portugal and the Soviet Union established 
diplomatic relations for the first time since the October 
Revolution. Six months later Cunhal had his first meeting 
with the KGB resident in Lisbon, Svyatoslav Fyodorovich 
Kuznetsov (code-named LEONID), who operated under 
diplomatic cover in the recently established Soviet 
embassy. Though the meeting took place in a Portuguese 
Communist Party (PCP) safe house, both men were so 
fearful their conversation might be bugged that they 
conducted an entirely silent dialogue with pencil and 
paper. It was agreed that the KGB would train two 
reliable Party members to detect eavesdropping 
equipment so that their future discussions could be by 
word of mouth. Cunhal also undertook to hand over 
material on the Portuguese security service, NATO (of 
which Portugal had been a founder member) and other 
“matters of interest to the KGB.”^^ 

Shortly after the revolution of April 1974, a 
commission of enquiry was given access to the files of the 
brutal security service of the deposed regime (known 
successively as the PIDE and DGS), whose vast network 



of informers had almost rivaled those of the Soviet Bloc. 
Since the PCP, whose 22-member Central Committee had 
between them spent 308 years in jail, had been the chief 
target of the PIDE/DGS, it was, unsurprisingly, well 
represented on the commission.^^ As well as passing on 
large numbers of PIDE/DGS documents (some of which 
concerned collaboration with Western intelligence 
services), the PCP also provided the Lisbon residency 
with files from Portuguese military intelligence and the 
new security service established after the revolution. 
According to one of the files noted by Mitrokhin, the total 
weight of the classified material provided by the PCP to 
the Lisbon residency in the mid-1970s came to 474 
kilograms. In January 1976 a special section was created 
within the FCD Fifth Department to work on the 
Portuguese documents which in their microfilm version 
filled 68,138 frames. Mitrokhin ’s summary of the 
Centre’s report on the material concludes: 

Extremely important information was obtained about 
the structure, methods of work and agent networks of 
the Special [intelligence] Services of the USA, 
France, the ERG and Spain on the territory of 
Portugal; on their cooperation with and the agent 
networks of PIDE/DGS in Portugal and its former 
colonies; on the armed forces of Portugal and of a 
number of other countries; on the methods of work 
of the Portuguese Special Services against the Soviet 



Union and other socialist countries; on the agent 
operational situation in the country and at target 
establishments of interest to the KGB; [and] on 
individuals of operational interest to the KGB.^^ 

Service A made use of the documents, in both authentic 
and doctored form, as the basis of active measures 
designed to discredit the CIA, French and West German 
intelligence services.^^ 

In April 1975, at Portugal’s first free post-war 
elections, the Communists gained only 12.5 percent of the 
vote — one third of the support won by the socialists under 
Soares. Cunhal, however, shrugged off the setback, 
confident that real power would remain with the Armed 
Forces Movement, which had made the revolution a year 
before. “The elections,” he told an interviewer, “have 
nothing or very little to do with the dynamics of 
revolution ... I promise you there will be no parliament in 
Portugal.” Cunhal’ s prediction proved hopelessly 
mistaken. His support within the Armed Forces 
Movement crumbled after the failure of a left-wing coup 
in November, and new elections in April 1976 gave the 
Communists only 14.5 percent of the vote, as compared 
with the socialists’ 35 percent. Soares became prime 
minister and Cunhal led the PCP into opposition. 

The PCP leadership continued in opposition to talent- 
spot for the KGB.^^ During talks in Moscow in July 1977 



the FCD asked PATRICK, a member of the PCP 
Politburo, to identify PCP members suitable for training 
as illegal agents to operate against NATO. PATRICK saw 
no difficulty in using experienced Party members for 
particular intelligence assignments, but was less happy 
with using them as long-term illegals since this would 
require them to give up their work for the PCP. Once back 
in Lisbon, however, PATRICK suggested the names of 
five possible candidates “without heavy Party 
responsibilities” and provided blank Portuguese passports 
and other identity documents to assist in the fabrication of 
their legends. 

While the FCD was holding discussions with 
PATRICK in July 1977, an almost identical approach was 
being made to the veteran chairman of the Finnish 
Communist Party (SKP), Ville Pessi (codenamed 
BARANOV), then on holiday in the Soviet Union. Pessi 
agreed to suggest the names of four or five undeclared 
members of the SKP or trusted fellow travellers to train as 
illegal agents who could be used against American and 
NATO targets in the United States, Norway, Denmark or 
the Low Countries. He was also asked to find another one 
or two potential agents in registry offices or other 
locations able to provide the documentation required for 
the fabrication of illegals’ legends. At about the same 
time that PATRICK and BARANOV were engaged in 
discussions in Moscow, Andropov authorized an 
approach in Dublin by the resident, Mikhail 



Konstantinovich Shadrin (codenamed KAVERIN), to a 
leading Irish Communist (codenamed GRUM), who 
cannot be identified for legal reasons. GRUM agreed that 
two undeclared members of the Party should be selected 
for training as the first Irish illegals. 

The approaches to Communist Parties outside the 
Soviet Bloc coincided with a series of exhortations from 
Kryuchkov, the head of the FCD, to residencies to 
improve their Line N (Illegal support) performance. 
Increasingly close surveillance of legal residencies by 
Western counterintelligence agencies made the expansion 
of the illegal network of increasing importance. 
Kryuchkov was not satisfied, however, with the efforts 
made by residencies to follow up recruiting leads for 
illegal agents provided by Western Communist Parties 
and other sources. He complained in a circular of April 
1978: 

In a number of residencies Line N work has been 
only half-heartedly pursued on the part of residents; 
the deep study of those who could be utilized for 
illegal espionage, especially as special [illegal] 
agents, has not been conducted sufficiently 
purposefully ...^^ 

By the mid-1970s most Western, Latin American and 
some Middle Eastern, North African and Asian 
Communist Parties had been drawn into the quest for a 



new generation of illegals. There is, however, no 
evidence that the almost global recruiting program 
conducted by the KGB and fraternal parties turned up 
another Arnold Deutsch or Richard Sorge.^^ So far as the 
recruiting leads produced by Western Communist leaders 
are concerned, Mitrokhin’s notes reveal no major 
successes and a number of failures. 

The failures included Maria, a Portuguese Communist 
language teacher recommended as a potential illegal agent 
by PATRICK of the PCP Central Committee. The Centre 
planned to recruit Maria as the assistant and wife of an 
illegal KGB officer, Aleksandr Nikolayevich Kunosenko 
(codenamed YEFREMOV), who was being trained for 
work in Brazil. A meeting arranged between 
YEFREMOV and his proposed bride in East Germany, 
however, ended in disaster. Maria found Kunosenko 
physically unattractive and refused to sleep with him; her 
recruitment was discontinued. Without Maria’s 
assistance, Kunosenko failed to become sufficiently fluent 
in Portuguese. In 1981 plans for his posting to Brazil were 
cancelled and he was redeployed in Directorate S 
headquarters.^^ 

Among the more promising illegal agents discovered as 
a result of leads from Western Communist Parties were a 
French couple, LIMB and his wife DANA, who were 
recruited in 1973. LIMB was recommended by the PCF as 
a man “devoted to Communist ideals” but not to be used 



against French targets. After two years’ training, however, 
limb’s first recorded success was talent- spotting a 
French recruit. MARCEL, LIMB’s recruitment lead, 
worked in the mairie of a Paris suburb and was recruited 
as a KGB agent in 1975, probably to provide 
documentation for KGB illegals. In December 1975 
LIMB (then aged thirty-six) and DANA were deployed to 
Belgium, where they set up a small business printing 
invitation and visiting cards near the headquarters of 
SACEUR (Supreme Allied Commander Europe). But 
their attempts over the next year to cultivate NATO 
personnel met with little or no success. By the end of 
1976 they had returned to France, settled in the Bordeaux 
region and abandoned their brief careers as KGB illegal 
agents. 

Thirty or forty years before, the recruiting drive for 
illegal agents would doubtless have met with much 
greater success. Its apparent failure in the 1970s reflected 
the inability of the Soviet Union under Brezhnev’s 
geriatric leadership to recapture the idealism of an earlier 
generation of ideological agents inspired by the utopian 
vision of the world’s first worker — ^peasant state. By the 
mid-1970s most of the leading Western Communist 
Parties were tainted by what Moscow considered the 
“Eurocommunist” heresy, which advocated a 
parliamentary road to socialism within a multi-party 
system rather than slavish imitation of the Soviet model. 
Within the new generation of young Western Marxists, 



unconditional pro- Soviet loyalists were a dwindling breed 
— if not yet an endangered species. 

JUST AS THE Centre expected fraternal assistance from 
the leaders of Western Communist parties, so the parties 
themselves depended in varying degrees on subsidies 
from Moscow secretly delivered by the KGB. The 
subsidies, like involvement in intelligence operations, 
were closely guarded secrets within each Party leadership. 
When stories of “Moscow gold” occasionally leaked out 
during the Cold War, they were dismissed as McCarthyite 
disinformation. The Centre, however, was well aware that 
some details of its secret subsidies were known to 
Western intelligence agencies. During the late 1970s, for 
example, the Soviet ambassador in Ottawa, Aleksandr 
Nikolayevich Yakovlev (later one of Gorbachev’s leading 
advisers), protested to Andropov, Gromyko and Boris 
Ponomarev, head of the Central Committee’s 
International Department, against the practice of Canadian 
Communist Party representatives — in particular the Party 
leader, William Kashtan — of calling at the embassy to 
collect funds (codenamed “US wheat”) from the resident, 
Vladimir Ivanovich Mechulayev. The residency had 
already warned Kashtan that he was taking a considerable 
risk. By 1980 the Centre was convinced that the Canadian 
authorities were aware that subsidies to the CPC were 
being funded by the Soviet-owned Ukrainskaya Kniga 
[Ukrainian Book] Company, based in Toronto. The FCD 



informed Ponomarev on October 20: 


The Canadian Special [intelligence] Services are 
carrying out a study of the financial situation of the 
Communist Party of Canada which it is proposed to 
complete within 15-18 months. A preliminary report 
prepared by the federal government quotes data 
based on the results of an analysis of the channels 
and size of the financial receipts in the CPC treasury 
in 1970. The Special Services have only fragmentary 
information about subsequent years, but these give 
grounds to suppose that the methods of financing the 
activities of the CPC remain as before. According to 
the data of the Special Services, the CPC budget in 
1970 amounted to 158,850 dollars (according to 
unconfirmed reports, in 1979 it was more than 
200,000 dollars). This sum is made up of Party 
membership dues from CPC members (13,500 
dollars or 8.5 percent), receipts from legacies from 
“deceased loyal members of the Party” (the amount 
cannot be estimated), voluntary payments and also 
direct transfers of cash by Soviet representatives and 
contributions to CPC funds from the income of the 
Ukrainskaya Kniga Company. It is noted that the 
first three sources of income provide approximately 
30-35 percent of the Party’s total budget. The 
remaining part [65-70 percent] comes from the 
USSR and from Ukrainskaya Kniga. The Special 



Services report concentrates on an analysis of the 
mechanism for supplying funds along the last two 
channels. [Canadian] Counter-intelligence concludes 
that the USSR finances the CPC by means of 
“physical transfer of cash” by officials of the Soviet 
embassy in Ottawa, to be put at the disposal of Party 
functionaries under pretext of covering the expenses 
of Party activists on the occasion of their journeys to 
Socialist countries. 

The seizure by Boris Yeltsin’s government of the 
archives of the Soviet Communist Party (CPSU) after the 
failed coup of August 1991 led to the publication for the 
first time of documentary evidence showing that during 
the 1980s alone, at a time when the Soviet Union was 
chronically short of hard currency, the CPSU had 
distributed over 200 million dollars to fraternal parties 
outside the Soviet Bloc. The Central Committee’s 
International Department had tried to destroy the records 
of the payments shortly before the confiscation of its 
archive, but the metal paper clips which held the 
documents together jammed the shredding machines and 
saved some of them from destruction.^^ 

THOUGH THE LARGEST Subsidies for most of the 
Cold War seem to have gone to the French PCF and 
Italian PCI, the two leading Western Parties, the biggest 
per capita donations probably went to the Communist 



Party of the United States. The disproportionate share of 
Soviet funds channelled to the CPUS A reflected 
Moscow’s desire to encourage the revival of Communism 
on the territory of the Main Adversary after the near 
disintegration of the Party in the mid-1950s. The CPUSA 
repaid Soviet generosity with an impeccable ideological 
orthodoxy which became particularly valued in Moscow 
when the heresy of Eurocommunism later took hold of the 
major west European Communist Parties. 

In April 1958 a veteran member of the CPUSA 
leadership, Morris Childs (whose aliases included “Morris 
Summers,” “Ramsey Kemp Martin” and “D. Douglas 
Mozart”) was invited to Moscow to discuss financial help 
for his ailing party. Boris Ponomarev, the head of the 
Central Committee international department, offered 
75,000 dollars for the current year and 200,000 dollars for 
1959, initially channelled via the Canadian Communist 
Party.^^ From 1961 to 1980 the conduits for Soviet 
subsidies were Childs (codenamed KHAB) and his 
brother Jack (alias “D. Brooks,” codenamed MARAT), an 
undeclared Communist who had worked for Comintern in 
the 1930s. Until the late 1970s Morris Childs usually 
visited Moscow at least once a year to submit the CPUSA 
budget and request for funds, receive instructions from 
the International Department and the KGB and take part 
in discussions on American affairs. Jack acted as the main 
point of contact for the handover of money in the United 
States. The normal procedure was for the Centre to send a 



coded message to a CPUS A radio operator in New York 
containing details of the next transmission of funds. The 
message would then be passed to Jack Childs, who would 
decode it and inform his brother, Gus Hall (leader of the 
CPUS A from 1959 and codenamed PALM), or Hall’s 
wife Elizabeth that the next delivery was imminent.^^ 

From 1968 the CPUS A radio operator who passed 
messages from the Centre on to Jack Childs was another 
undeclared party member of Russian descent, Albert 
Friedman, codenamed FORD, who worked as a salesman 
in a Manhattan radio store on East 49th Street. Using the 
alias Weber, Friedman had worked between the wars at 
Comintern’s radio school in Moscow, training other 
underground radio operators. In January 1969 he travelled 
to Moscow for further training,^^ but performed so well 
that his instructor told him, “You know more than I do” 
and invited him to lunch. Though Friedman paid Party 
dues, his membership of the CPUS A was known only to 
the KGB and a small group within the Party leadership.^^ 
What neither the KGB nor CPUS A leaders knew, 
however, was that since the end of the Second World War 
Friedman had been an FBI agent in the Party, codenamed 
CLIP. He passed every word of the Centre’s 
communications on to the Bureau. 

By the late 1960s Soviet subsidies to the CPUS A 
amounted to well over a million dollars a year; a decade 
later they were more than two million. Jack Childs 



(MARAT) usually took delivery of Soviet subsidies from 
KGB operations officers during “brush passes” at pre- 
arranged locations in New York, all at precisely 3:05 p.m. 
During 1974, for example, money- transfer operations 
(then codenamed VALDAY) took place at four locations 
in Lower Manhattan: 10 Pine Street, 10th floor 
(codenamed DINO); 1 1 Broadway, 9th floor (FRED); 120 
Wall Street, 7th floor (POST); and 81 New Street, 2nd 
floor (ROLAND). All four addresses were chosen by the 
New York residency because they had several entrances 
and exits. MARAT and the KGB operations officer 
chosen to hand the money over to him entered and left the 
building selected for their brush contact through different 
doors. In order to lessen the increasing bulk of the 
packages of money handed over in brush contacts, the 
denomination of the bills contained in them was raised in 
1974 from 20 dollars to 50 dollars and 100 dollars. On 
the grounds that it was too dangerous to pass the money 
to Hall, who was under close surveillance by the FBI, the 
New York police and the Internal Revenue Service, Jack 
Childs gave much of it to his brother Morris for 
safekeeping. 

As well as acting as a conduit for Soviet subsidies. Jack 
Childs also regularly exchanged written messages with 
the New York residency either through brush contacts or 
“dead drops.” Like brush contact sites, dead drops were 
all given codenames; those in use in 1974 were MANDI, 
LYUSI, OPEY, RIBA and OVERA. Messages were 



normally sent on undeveloped film from a Minox camera 
placed in a magnetic container. One of the files noted by 
Mitrokhin records that between July 1975 and August 
1976 MARAT took part in five VALDAY operations and 
nine to exchange secret messages (five by brush contact, 
four by dead drop). In an emergency the residency could 
arrange an urgent meeting with MARAT by ringing a 
designated telephone number at precisely five minutes 
past noon and asking for Dr. Albert. On being told, 
“There is no Dr. Albert here” the residency officer would 
reply, “Sorry, must have the wrong number.” He would 
then meet MARAT at 3:05 p.m. the same day at a 
Brooklyn location codenamed ELLIOT, at the entrance to 
the Silver Road pharmacy on the comer of Avenue J and 
East 16th Street, next to the subway station. MARAT 
identified himself by carrying a copy of Time magazine 
and placing a Bandaid on his left hand. The operations 
officer asked him, “Do you have the time?” When 
MARAT replied, “Ifs 3:05 sharp,” he produced a 
business card from one of MARAT ’s former employers 
with a note by KHAB, his brother Morris, on the back.^^ 
The elaborate security employed by the KGB in 
contacts with both MARAT and KHAB suffered, 
however, from one fatal flaw. Since the early 1950s both 
had been FBI agents. By 1974 the Centre had become 
suspicious, particularly about KHAB (Morris Childs). He 
had not been imprisoned during the anti-Communist 
witch-hunts of the 1950s, nor had he been arrested for 



travelling abroad on false passports (a fact of which the 
FBI was believed to be aware). A 1967 report by the 
Senate Judiciary Committee had referred to him under the 
names Morris Chilovsky (his name at birth) and Morris 
Summers (one of his aliases) and mentioned his pre-war 
links with Soviet intelligence. The Centre also found 
suspicious KHAB’s determination to accompany Gus 
Hall on all his trips to Russia and his “nervousness” when 
Moscow bypassed him and his brother and communicated 
directly with Hall. In March 1974 Vladimir Mikhailovich 
Kazakov, head of the FCD First (North American) 
Department, reported to Andropov and the Central 
Committee: 

Although [Morris] Childs enjoys the trust of 
Comrade Gus Hall, his direct involvement in the 
financial affairs of the US Communist Party 
constitutes a real threat to this special channel [for 
the transmission of Soviet funds]. In addition, certain 
doubtful and suspicious elements in M. Childs’s 
behavior lead one to believe that he is possibly being 
used by US intelligence. 

Kazakov also urged that Hall be persuaded to find a 
substitute for MARAT (Jack Childs), whom he described 
as absent-minded and in poor health. 

At a meeting with Hall in Moscow on May 8, another 
senior FCD officer, B. S. Ivanov, tried to persuade him 



that the time had come to retire both the Childs brothers, 
whose long involvement in secret work placed them under 
increasing danger of FBI surveillance. Ivanov suggested a 
number of alternative methods of transferring Soviet 
funds to the CPUS A, among them opening a Swiss bank 
account or using a cover business in the United States. 
But, though Hall said he had found a “reliable comrade” 
to replace Jack Childs, he took no action and the 
International Department, which evidently did not take 
Kazakov’s warning very seriously, did not insist. 

In 1975 Morris and Jack Childs were awarded the 
Order of the Red Banner; Morris received his in person 
from Brezhnev during a Moscow banquet. Back in the 
United States both brothers lived in some style, 
embezzling about 5 percent of the Soviet funds sent to the 
CPUS A as well as receiving a salary from the FBI. Morris 
posed as a wealthy businessman with a penthouse in 
Chicago, expensively furnished with antiques, paintings 
and oriental carpets, as well as apartments in Moscow and 
New York. Gus Hall, who naively believed both brothers 
to be independently wealthy, sometimes asked them to 
buy clothes for his family. 

Among the intelligence which the Childs brothers 
reported to the FBI for more than twenty years were the 
claims of the CPUS A leadership to influence on the black 
civil rights movement. In 1958 Jack Childs had reported a 
boast by James Jackson, Party secretary in charge of 
“Negro and Southern Affairs,” that “most secret and 



guarded people” were “guiding” the civil rights leader 
Martin Luther KingJ^ According to one KGB file, 
Dobrynin, the Soviet ambassador, later asked Hall to stop 
bringing Jackson, whom he described as “poorly trained 
politically,” to meetings with him; he also requested the 
Soviet mission to the UN (by which he probably meant 
the KGB New York residency) to break off contact with 
Jackson.^^ 

There was, however, some substance to the claim that 
the CPUS A had penetrated King’s entourage. The Childs 
brothers reported that one of King’s advisers, Stanley D. 
Levison, a New York lawyer and entrepreneur, was a 
secret Party member. Levison drafted sections of 
King’s 1958 book. Stride Toward Freedom, and helped 
prepare his defense against trumped-up charges of perjury 
on his Alabama tax returns in 1960.^^ Levison also 
introduced into King’s entourage a secret black member 
of the CPUSA, Hunter Pitts “Jack” O’Dell.^^ The FBI, 
who put Levison under surveillance, reported that he was 
meeting Viktor Lesiovsky, a KGB officer working as 
special assistant to the UN Secretary-General, U Thant. 

It was Levison ’s alleged influence on King which in 1963 
led Attorney-General Robert Kennedy to authorize the 
bugging of King’s hotel rooms. Though the bugs 
produced recordings of a number of King’s sexual 
liaisons, in which President Lyndon B. Johnson took a 
prurient interest, they provided no evidence of 



Communist influence on him.^^ 

At the beginning of the Carter administration in 1977, 
the CPUS A leadership made exaggerated claims of its 
influence over King’s former executive secretary, Andrew 
Young (codenamed LUTHER), newly appointed as US 
representative at the United Nations. According to Hall, 
“Young himself did not know that several of his close 
friends in Atlanta were covert Communists, and he 
listened to them. The Party, while observing the required 
clandestinity, would cautiously exert an influence on 
Young in the necessary areas. Lesiovsky’s cover as 
assistant to U Thant gave him a number of opportunities 
for discussions with Young. Though he claimed to have 
obtained “important information” from the discussions, he 
reported — less optimistically than Hall — that, while 
Young hoped for better US- Soviet relations, his attitude 
to the Soviet Union was fundamentally “negative. 

Though Hall tended to overstate the influence of 
undeclared members of the CPUS A within the 
Democratic Party, there was at least one to whom the 
Centre attached real importance during the 1970s: a 
Democratic activist in California recruited as a KGB 
agent during a visit to Russia. The agent, who is not 
identified by name in the reports noted by Mitrokhin, had 
a wide circle of influential contacts in the Democratic 
Party: among them Governor Jerry Brown of California, 
Senator Alan Cranston, Senator Eugene McCarthy, 



Senator Edward Kennedy, Senator Abraham Ribicoff, 
Senator J. William Fulbright and Congressman John 
Conyers, Jr. During the 1976 presidential election the 
agent was able to provide inside information from within 
the Carter camp and a profile of Carter himself, which 
were particularly highly valued by the Centre since it had 
so few high-level American sources. On one occasion he 
spent three hours discussing the progress of the campaign 
at a meeting with Carter, Brown and Cranston in Carter’s 
room at the Pacific Hotel. His report was forwarded to the 
Politburo. During the final stages of the campaign the 
agent had what the KGB claimed were “direct and 
prolonged conversations” with Carter, Governor Brown 
and Senators Cranston, Kennedy, Ribicoff and Jacob 
Javits. Andropov attached such importance to the report 
on these conversations that he forwarded it under his 
signature to the Politburo immediately after Carter’s 
election. 

IN NOVEMBER 1977 the Centre sent a memorandum to 
the Central Committee complaining that, despite several 
requests to Hall to replace the Childs brothers, they were 
still running the American end of the “covert channel of 
communication with the US Communist Party.” During 
Jack’s illness in August and September, Morris had 
replaced him as the CPUS A’ s representative at a meeting 
with a KGB officer in New York: 



His use in the special channel operation is very risky, 
since [Morris] Childs is known to the intelligence 
service — as is evidenced by the US Senate Judiciary 
Committee’s report for 1967, where he is referred to 
as a person who uses several names and has contact 
with the KGB. Because of this, one cannot exclude 
the possibility that the FBI has him under covert 
surveillance. 

On November 10 Kazakov and Ivanov raised the 
question of replacing the Childs brothers at another 
meeting with Hall in Moscow. Hall said that he had three 
candidates in mind as a replacement for Jack Childs — 
John Vogo and the Applekhoums [? Appleholmes] 
brothers. He would make his final choice in the near 
future and announce his decision by a coded telegram to 
Moscow reporting the completion of a draft article on 
colonialism. The number of the draft indicated in the 
telegram (first, second or third) would indicate which 
candidate he had selected. Jack Child’s successor would 
then apply for a visa at the Soviet consulate in Vienna so 
that he could receive one and a half to two months of 
“special training” in Moscow. Hall also suggested that the 
KGB use the wife of his personal chauffeur and 
bodyguard as an additional channel of communication in 
New York. The residency could telephone her at work, 
identifying itself by using the parole, “This is Mr. Budnik 
calling about the old furniture. My friend from Hoboken 



suggested contacting you.”^^ 

Once again, however, Hall delayed taking action. The 
Childs brothers continued to take part in the “special 
channel operation” for the remainder of the decade. One 
of the files noted by Mitrokhin records that during the 
eight months up to April 1978 Jack Childs conducted 
nineteen operations: three VALDAY money transfers, 
two meetings with KGB officers, five dead drops, six 
brush contacts and three operations to signal contacts. 
By the spring of 1980, however, the FBI had concluded 
that the Childs were in imminent danger of being 
compromised. On May 28, as a pretext for withdrawing 
from the “special channel,” Morris Childs told Hall that 
unidentified men had been calling on his neighbors 
making enquiries about him and he feared he might have 
to go into hiding to avoid arrest. He handed Hall 225,437 
dollars in cash, which, he claimed, was all the money 
from Moscow in his possession. Jack Childs, who had 
been in failing health for some time, died in a New York 
hospital on August 12. Morris and Eva Childs retired to a 
luxurious condominium north of Miami with spectacular 
views over the Atlantic. In 1987, at a special ceremony at 
FBI headquarters, Morris was presented by President 
Reagan with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. He and 
his brother Jack, who was awarded the same medal 
posthumously, thus became the only spies ever to be 
decorated by both the Soviet Union and the United 



States. 

Throughout the decades when the Childs brothers 
operated the secret channel to Moscow, the CPUS A had 
been wholly marginal to American politics. In four 
presidential elections between 1972 and 1984 Gus Hall 
never received more than 59,000 votes; after falling to 
35,000 in 1984, he decided to support the Democrats in 
1988. After dropping well below 10,000 members in the 
mid-1970s, the Party staged a modest revival but in the 
later 1980s was only about 15,000 strong. Hall, 
however, continued to inhabit a fantasy world in which 
the CPUS A had a major influence on American politics. 
He wrote to Boris Ponomarev, the head of the 
International Department, in the autumn of 1981: 

More than at any moment in recent history, I am 
convinced that our Party can be an important factor 
in slowing down, stopping and reversing the present 
reactionary policies of the Reagan administration. 
Tens of millions have become disillusioned. They 
are moving towards mass actions, and millions are in 
ideological flux. Our Party can be an important and 
even a decisive factor in influencing and moving 
these masses. 

As on this occasion. Hall’s fantasy assessments of the 
CPUS A’ s growing influence were accompanied by 
appeals for Soviet subsidies, which for most of the 1980s 



ran at 2 million dollars a year. In 1987 Hall asked for a 
large increase: 

I can only argue that because our party works in the 
decaying heart of imperialism whatever we do in 
influencing events in the United States has an impact 
on world developments. And, because of the crisis of 
the Reagan presidency, which is deep and chronic 
now, our Party’s work has had and continues to have 
a growing impact on the politics of our country. 

Therefore, in the context of the struggle against 
US imperialism and the policies of the Reagan 
administration, our party must be seen as an 
important, and even indispensable, factor. 

The CPUSA’s subsidy for the following year was put up 
to three million dollars. 

Morris Childs believed that the remarkable generosity 
of Soviet donations to the CPUS A (200 dollars a member 
in 1987) was due partly to the fact that the Kremlin took 
Gus Hall’s claims at least semi-seriously and “ludicrously 
overestimated the influence of the American party. The 
generosity was also due, however, to the ideological 
servility of Hall and the CPUS A leadership. According to 
Dorothy Ray Healey, a prominent party militant for forty- 
five years: 


Under Gus’s leadership the American CP had picked 



up the dubious distinction of being the chief 
ideological sheepdog in the international Communist 
movement, barking on command when any of the 
other lambs threatened to stray from the fold. The 
Soviet leaders would contact Gus and tell him what 
they wanted him to say, he would say it, and then 
Pravda could run a story saying that embattled 
American Communists speaking from the heartland 
of world imperialism had thus-and-such to say about 
whatever issue was of particular concern to the 
Soviets at the moment.^^ 



EIGHTEEN 


EUROCOMMUNISM 


A conference of eighty-five Communist parties held in 
Moscow in 1960 unanimously reaffirmed loyalty to the 
Soviet Union as an unshakeable article of faith for 
Communists in both East and West: 

The Communist Party of the Soviet Union has been, 
and remains, the universally recognized vanguard of 
the world Communist movement, being the most 
experienced and steeled contingent of the 
international Communist movement. 

By the end of the decade, however, the CPSU leadership 
was outraged to find its infallibility being called into 
question by the emergence of what was later termed 
“Eurocommunism.” The Eurocommunist heresy made its 
first public appearance after the suppression of the Prague 
Spring in 1968, when a number of Western parties 
ventured some, mostly timid, criticisms of the Soviet 
invasion. The leadership of the PCI (Partito Comunista 
Italiano), later the dominant force in Eurocommunism, 



reaffirmed “the profound, fraternal and genuine ties that 
unite the Italian Communist Party to the Soviet Union and 
the CPSU,” but denied the right of the Soviet Union to 
intervene militarily “in the internal life of another 
Communist Party or another country.”^ 

“The profound, fraternal and genuine ties” which 
bound the PCI to the Soviet Union even after Soviet tanks 
had entered Prague had a secret dimension of which very 
few Italian Communists outside the Direzione were 
aware. After the Colonels’ coup in Athens in April 1967, 
the PCI general secretary, Luigi Longo, and other party 
leaders had become alarmed by the possibility of an 
Italian military putsch on the Greek model. In the summer 
of 1967, Giorgio Amendola, on behalf of the PCI 
Direzione, formally requested Soviet assistance in 
preparing the Party for survival after a coup as an illegal 
underground movement. Politburo decision no. P50/P of 
August 15 authorized the FCD to draw up a program 
which was intended to give the PCI its own intelligence 
unit with fully trained staff and a clandestine radio 
communications system. Details of the program were 
agreed in talks in Moscow between ANDREA, the head 
of the PCI’s illegal apparatus, and senior Central 
Committee officials and KGB officers. Between October 
1967 and May 1968 three Italian radio operators 
completed a four-month KGB training course. Other Party 
members took courses in producing bogus identity 
documents, following a syllabus which devoted ninety-six 



hours to the production of rubber stamps and document 
seals, six to the art of embossing with synthetic resins, six 
to changing photographs on identity documents, six to 
making handwritten entries on documents and twelve to 
“theoretical discussions.” These and other secret training 
programs continued at least until the end of the 1970s. 
The PCI leadership also asked the KGB to check its 
headquarters for listening devices.^ 

After the immediate PCI protest at the suppression of 
the Prague Spring in 1968, open criticism quickly 
subsided. Before the PCI Twelfth Congress in February 
1969, both Boris Ponomarev, head of the Central 
Committee’s International Department, and senior KGB 
officers put heavy pressure on Luigi Longo and other 
Party leaders to tone down their comments on 
Cezchoslovakia in speeches to the conference. In reports 
to the CPSU Central Committee, Ponomarev and the 
KGB claimed the credit for the fact that, despite the 
retention of some “ambiguous phrases,” all references to 
“intervention” and “occupation” by the Soviet Union and 
its allies in the Warsaw Pact were removed. Nor was there 
any call by the PCI for the withdrawal of Warsaw Pact 
forces from Czechoslovakia.^ In a private discussion in 
1970 with Nikita Ryzhov, the Soviet ambassador, Longo 
“particularly emphasized that for the Italian Communists 
friendship with the CPSU and the Soviet Union was not a 
formality but a real necessity for their existence.”^ 



Longo also depended heavily on Soviet subsidies. He 
was at his most importunate when a general election was 
called one year ahead of schedule in May 1972. The 
original CPSU Politburo allocation for the election year 
was 5,200,000 dollars — 2 million more than in 1971. 
After a further appeal from Longo, it provided another 
500,000 dollars. Longo then wrote another begging letter, 
to which Brezhnev sent a personal reply, delivered by the 
Rome resident, Gennadi Fyodorovich Borzov (alias 
“Bystrov”), on April 4: 

Dear Comrade Longo, 

We have received your letter requesting additional 
assistance to meet expenses relating to the Italian 
Communist Party’s participation in the electoral 
campaign. 

We well understand the difficult nature of the 
situation in which this campaign is taking place, and 
the need for the intense activity which your Party 
must exert in this connection in order to win the 
elections and resist the forces of reaction. 

As you. Comrade Longo, know, we have already 
allocated an additional US $500,000 for the Italian 
Communist Party to take part in the electoral 
campaign, thus bringing the total [contribution] this 
year to US $5,700,000. 

In the light of your request, we once again 
carefully studied all the possibilities open to us, and 



decided to give the Italian Communist Party further 
assistance to the amount of US $500,000. 
Unfortunately, at the present time, there is no more 
that we can do. 


With Communist greetings, 

[Signed] L. Brezhnev 

General Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee^ 
After handing the letter to Longo, Borzov reported to the 
Centre: 

The Ambassador [Nikita Ryzhov] declared that as 
we had gone behind his back he intended to 
telegraph Comrade Brezhnev about this. Bearing in 
mind Ryzhov’ s difficult character, and his extremely 
sensitive reaction to things of this kind, this 
particular incident has greatly exacerbated the 
Ambassador’s attitude towards us. 

The Centre ordered Borzov to do his best to pacify the 
Ambassador: 

Tell Ryzhov that you assumed he would be made 
aware in Moscow of the decision taken by the 
Instantsiya [CPSU leadership]. On your own behalf, 
ask Comrade Ryzhov to treat all this with proper 
understanding and not to attach exaggerated 



importance to what has happened; tell him that our 
relations with him will continue to be businesslike 
and that the Ambassador will be fiilly informed 
about all our contacts with our friends [the PCI].^ 

In October 1972, Borzov reported that the “friends” had 
handed back three 100-dollar notes which had, 
embarrassingly, turned out to be forgeries.^ 

Until 1976 the transfer of funds to the Communist 
Party was a far more straightforward business in Rome 
than in the United States or many other parts of the world. 
Since leading Italian Communists regularly called at the 
Soviet embassy, it was thought unnecessary to resort to 
the clandestine rigmarole of brush contacts and dead- 
drops. The most dependable Soviet loyalist on the PCI 
Direzione, who was in regular contact with the KGB, 
simply selected a series of emissaries who drove to the 
embassy and collected the money, having first checked 
that their cars were not being followed. The KGB 
residency’s KOMETA radio-listening post simultaneously 
monitored the wavelengths used by Italian police and 
security forces in order to detect any signs of surveillance. 
As an additional precaution, the emissary was followed to 
and from the embassy by a PCI car.^ Moscow provided 
further financial assistance through lucrative contracts 
with PCI-controlled companies in business ventures 
ranging from Soviet oil imports to hotel construction in 



the Soviet Union.^ 

The PCI’s fears of a right-wing military coup were 
revived by the overthrow of President Salvador Allende’s 
Unidad Popular government in Chile by the armed forces 
in September 1973. In December the PCI took secret 
delivery from the KGB of three SELENGA radio stations 
in order to enable Party headquarters to maintain contact 
with local branches if the PCI was forced underground. 
Party radio technicians were trained in Russia to operate 
the new system. In the aftermath of a coup the SELENGA 
radios would transmit messages to Moscow which would 
then be retransmitted to local PCI underground groups by 
powerful Soviet transmitters.^^ 

The renewed fear of an Italian putsch, however, also 
drove the PCI in directions which caused concern in 
Moscow that the West’s largest Communist Party was 
succumbing to ideological heresy. In a series of articles 
entitled “Reflections on Italy after the Events in Chile,” 
Enrico Berlinguer (who had succeeded Longo as general 
secretary in 1972) proposed, in a phrase which became 
famous, a compromesso storico (“historic compromise”) 
with the Socialists and the ruling Christian Democrats. 
Berlinguer was unlike any previous major Communist 
leader with whom the Kremlin had had to deal. His wife 
Letizia was a devout Catholic and he had agreed to their 
children being brought up in the Catholic faith. Longo had 
done his best to persuade Moscow that, despite his 



Catholic family, Berlinguer was the best available 
candidate and that his three main rivals, Giorgio 
Amendola, Gian Carlo Pajetta and Pietro Ingrao, were 
unsuitable for the post of general secretary. Amendola, 
according to Longo, “had a great deal of the bourgeois 
democrat about him and had too often committed 
revisionist errors;” Pajetta, “whose authority was 
dwindling, was too short-tempered and would not 
promote [Party] unity;” Ingrao was “superficial and given 
to unrealistic theoretical speculation.” Berlinguer, 
however, represented the new generation of Party leaders 
who had emerged since the Second World War.^^ 
Moscow was far from reassured. 

Berlinguer’ s original proposal for a “historic 
compromise” was conceived chiefly as a defense against 
the prospect of a right-wing coup, justified by Lenin’s 
dictum that revolutionaries must know when to retreat. 
Gradually, however, the proposal evolved into a more 
ambitious — and, in Moscow’s view, heretical — strategy, 
in which Catholic traditions of solidarity would combine 
with Communist collective action to produce a new 
political and social order. During 1975 Berlinguer 
emerged as the chief spokesman of what became known 
as Eurocommunism. The PCI joined with the Spanish 
PCE and French PCF in issuing what was, in effect, a 
Eurocommunist manifesto, distancing themselves from 
the Soviet model of socialism and committing themselves 
to free elections, a free press and a parliamentary road to 



socialism within a multi-party system. 

At a secret meeting with Ryzhov on December 12, 
1975, a KGB informant on the Direzione accused 
Berlinguer and the Party leadership of “a cowardly 
rejection of Leninism” and growing hostility to the Soviet 
Union. He appealed to the CPSU to issue a public 
criticism of the PCI line: “This will almost split the party, 
but it is the only way to save the situation.” The informant 
also claimed that the PCI leadership was planning to 
disrupt the conference of European Communist Parties, 
due to be held in East Berlin in the summer of 1976, by 
using it as a platform for its revisionist views. 

During the preparations for the East Berlin conference 
the Kremlin issued a series of thinly veiled public 
warnings to the Eurocommunists not to misbehave. 
Berlinguer, however, was not to be intimidated. During 
the Italian election campaign in June, he made what 
Moscow considered his most outrageous statement yet. 
Italian membership of NATO, Berlinguer declared, was 
on balance an advantage: “This guarantees us the kind of 
socialism that we want — to be precise, socialism in 
liberty, socialism of a pluralist kind.” The Kremlin 
responded with a scathing, though secret, letter of protest. 
Of far more significance so far as most of the PCI 
Direzione was concerned, however, was the fact that the 
Party received a record 34.5 percent of the vote (up 7.3 
percent since 1972). At the East Berlin conference on 
June 29-30 the clash between the CPSU and the 



Eurocommunists was thinly papered over by a bland 
communique calling for “internationalist solidarity.” The 
speeches of Berlinguer and other leading heretics, which 
drew attention to flaws in “existing socialism” (in other 
words, the Soviet model), were published in Pravda only 
in a censored version. 

In December 1976 the Bulgarian leader, Todor 
Zhivkov, always a faithful mouthpiece for the Kremlin, 
denounced Eurocommunism as one of the bourgeois 
propagandists’ “main lines of ideological subversion 
against proletarian internationalism.”^^ The Kremlin’s 
scope for a direct, frontal assault on Berlinguer, however, 
was limited by his immense popularity. Instead, 
Andropov instructed Kryuchkov, the head of the FCD, to 
prepare active measures to discredit him and other 
tribunes of Eurocommunism. A report prepared by the 
FCD for the Central Committee claimed that Berlinguer 
owned a plot of land in Sardinia, and had been involved in 
dubious building contracts worth tens of billions of lira. 

Remarkably, while hoping to destabilize Berlinguer by 
leaking evidence of his alleged corruption, Moscow 
continued to subsidize the PCI. The total subsidy for 1976 
was 6.5 million dollars. According to KGB files, 
however, the “operational situation” for the transfer of 
money in Rome had become more difficult. The newly 
appointed resident, Boris Solomatin (previously stationed 
in New York), concluded in 1976 that handing over 



money at the embassy was insufficiently clandestine. He 
agreed with Guido Cappelloni (codenamed ALBERTO), 
head of the PCI Central Committee administration 
department, that it would be safest for the money transfers 
to take place early on Sunday mornings at pre-arranged 
locations in the Rome suburbs which had been carefully 
checked beforehand by both the residency and the PCI. 
The route of the car used by the “friend” who received the 
money was kept under careful surveillance by PCI 
members; he then transferred the money to another car 
which delivered it to a secret Party office.^^ 

Despite its hostility to Berlinguer and 
Eurocommunism, the Soviet Politburo also continued to 
authorize KGB training in underground operations of 
specially selected Italian Communists. In 1979, for 
example, the PCI sent three Party members to Moscow 
for instruction by the FCD “Illegals” Directorate S. One 
was trained to act as radio and cipher instructor, another 
as a disguise specialist and the third in the fabrication of 
false documents.^ ^ 

Not all the conflicts between the PCI Direzione and the 
Communist parties of the Soviet Bloc became public. The 
most serious secret dispute in the late 1970s concerned 
the covert assistance given by a number of east European 
intelligence services to terrorist groups in the West. East 
Germany became, in the words of its last, non- 
Communist, minister of the interior, Peter-Michael 



Diestel, “an Eldorado for terrorists.” What most 
concerned the leaders of the PCI, however, was support 
by the Czechoslovak StB for the Italian Brigate Rosse 
(Red Brigades). Their anxieties reached a peak on 
March 16, 1978, when the Red Brigades ambushed a car 
carrying the president of the Christian Democrats, Aldo 
Moro, in the center of Rome. Moro’s chauffeur and his 
police escort were gunned down and Moro himself was 
bundled into a waiting car. For the next fifty- four days, 
while Moro was held prisoner in a secret hiding place, the 
nation agonized over whether or not to negotiate with the 
Red Brigades to save his life.^^ 

Though the PCI Direzione publicly maintained that 
there could be no deals with terrorists, it was privately 
tormented by the fear that news of the support given to 
the Red Brigades by the StB would leak out. Speaking for 
the Direzione, Arturo Colombi complained to the 
Czechoslovak ambassador in Rome, Vladimir Koucky, 
that a PCI delegation to Prague had been fobbed off when 
it had tried to raise the issue of help to the Red Brigades, 
some of whom, it believed, had been invited to 
Czechoslovakia. On May 4, 1978 Amendola warned 
Koucky that, if Moro’s kidnappers were caught and put 
on trial, the assistance given them by the StB “could all 
come out.” On this occasion, Rhyzov, the Soviet 
ambassador, sided with the PCI, telling Koucky “he had 
warned Czechoslovak representatives about contacts with 



the Red Brigades, but they would not listen to him.” 
Rhyzov was convinced that the StB residency in Rome 
was still secretly in touch with the Red Brigades. “You 
got a pennyworth of benefit [from the Red Brigades],” he 
told Koucky, “but did a hundred times more damage. 

The Italian authorities failed to discover Moro’s hiding 
place in time. On May 9, 1978 he was murdered by his 
kidnappers and his body left in the boot of a car in the 
center of Rome, midway between the headquarters of the 
PCI and those of the Christian Democrats. In the 
outpouring of grief and soul-searching which followed 
Moro’s assassination there was — to the relief of the 
Direzione — no mention of the involvement of the StB 
with the Red Brigades. During the police hunt for terrorist 
radio stations over the next few years, however, the PCI 
leadership became increasingly anxious that their own 
might be discovered. In June 1981 the PCI leadership 
informed the Rome residency that, for security reasons, 
the three radio stations installed by the KGB for 
clandestine Party use eight years earlier had been 
destroyed.^^ 

The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan at the end of 1979 
and the imposition of martial law in Poland two years 
later destroyed any semblance of a reconciliation between 
Moscow and the PCI. At a meeting of the PCI Central 
Committee in January 1982, only the KGB’s main contact 
voted against a motion condemning Soviet interference in 
Polish affairs. Berlinguer declared that the October 



Revolution had “exhausted its propulsive force,” implying 
in effect that the CPSU had lost its revolutionary 
credentials. The Direzione called on the west European 
left to work for the “democratic renewal” of the countries 
of the Soviet Bloc. Pravda denounced the PCI’s 
declarations as “truly blasphemous.” There followed what 
the Italians called lo strappo — a brief but highly polemical 
breach of relations between the PCI and CPSU. 

Within the Italian Party leadership, the hardliner 
Armando Cossutta was a lone voice in taking Moscow’s 
side in the quarrel.^^ A decade later, as the Soviet Union 
was disintegrating, evidence leaked out that Soviet 
subsidies to the PCI had continued on a reduced scale in 
the 1980s. But, according to one commentator, “It soon 
became clear that if Soviet funds had been channelled into 
Italy, they went through the hands ... of Cossutta, either to 
shore up a failing newspaper with pro- Soviet sympathies 
(Paese Sera) or to help finance his own activities against 
the PCI’s leaders.” The final recorded payments — 

700.000 dollars in 1985, 600,000 dollars in 1986 and 

630.000 dollars in 1987 — were used solely to provide 
“material support” to what the CPSU International 
Department and the KGB (but probably not Gorbachev) 
considered “the healthy forces in the PCI,” chief among 
them Cossutta and Paese Sera?^ 


BERLINGUER APART, THE Eurocommunist of whom 



Moscow was most suspicious was Santiago Carrillo, 
leader of the PCE (Partido Comunista de Espana). Even 
as a teenage militant, Carrillo had shown precocious 
leadership qualities. In 1936, at the age of only nineteen, 
mocked by his opponents as “the chrysalis in spectacles,” 
he engineered a fusion between the socialist and 
communist youth movements and became chairman of the 
combined organization. During the Spanish Civil War, 
Carrillo became a close friend of the celebrated NKVD 
illegal, saboteur and assassin Iosif Grigulevich, whom he 
subsequently chose as his son’s secular “godfather. 
Taking refuge in Moscow in 1939 after Franco’s victory 
in Spain, Carrillo proved his Stalinist orthodoxy by 
denouncing his own father, to whom he wrote with self- 
righteous fanaticism, “Between a Communist and a traitor 
there can be no relations of any kind.” He later claimed, 
implausibly, “If there was any fear of Stalin in the Soviet 
Union, I did not see it. For many years only a minority 
knew about the trials and the purges.”^ ^ 

After becoming general secretary of the exiled PCE in 
1959, however, Carrillo gradually evolved towards 
Eurocommunism. In 1968 the PCE executive committee 
condemned Soviet intervention in Czechoslovakia; its 
leading Soviet loyalists, Agustin G6mez, Eduardo Garcia 
and General Enrique Lister, were expelled in 1969-70.^^ 
In July 1975 the PCI and PCE jointly issued a “solemn 
declaration that their conception of the march towards 



socialism in peace and freedom expresses not a tactical 
attitude but a strategic conviction.” After Franco’s death 
in November, Carrillo began to plan the PCE’s 
reemergence as a legal party. Late in 1976, without 
informing Moscow, he returned secretly to Spain from his 
French headquarters. On December 6 the Centre sent an 
urgent telegram to the Madrid residency, telling it to 
investigate rumors that Carrillo was in Spain and, if so, to 
find out whether he had returned on his own initiative or 
after a secret agreement with the Christian Democrat 
prime minister, Adolfo Suarez.^^ 

In fact Carrillo had returned in order to try to force 
Suarez’s hand. On December 10 he gave a public news 
conference, thus compelling the Prime Minister to decide 
whether to risk the wrath of the army and the right by 
legalizing the PCE or to risk alienating the main 
democratic parties by refusing to do so. Though Carrillo 
was arrested on December 22, he was set at liberty a few 
days later and met secretly with Suarez. The formal 
legalization of the PCE followed in April 1977.^^ 

Just as in Italy, the KGB’s principal point of contact 
with the PCI was with a Soviet loyalist, so the Madrid 
residency’s main source within the PCE was the most 
pro- Soviet member of its executive committee, Ignacio 
Gallego, codenamed KOBO. Until March 1976 Soviet 
subsidies to the PCE had been forwarded via the French 
Communist Party, the PCF. By Politburo decision no. P- 
1/84 of March 16, however, the KGB was instructed to 



make payments directly to Gallego. At least some of these 
payments were intended for Gallego himself, rather than 
the PCE executive as a whole, so that he could “work on 
his contacts.” On December 6, 1976 the Politburo 
approved a payment to Gallego of 20,000 dollars 
(decision no. P37/39-OP) for the purchase of a flat in 
Madrid. Though his public criticism of Carrillo was 
muted, the Madrid residency reported that in private 
Gallego was bitterly critical, denouncing him as “a danger 
to the Spanish Communist Party and the international 
Communist movement.”^^ 

Early in 1977, through his wife LORA, Gallego passed 
on to the Madrid residency Carrillo’s draft of a joint 
declaration to be issued at a summit meeting of the 
leaders of the PCE, PCI and PCF, as well as the proofs of 
Carrillo’s forthcoming book, ‘"Eurocomunismo” y Estado 
(^Eurocommunism’' and the State)?^ The Centre was 
scandalized by the criticisms in both documents of the 
Soviet Union — though, in the event, Berlinguer and 
Georges Marchais, general secretary of the PCF, rejected 
the most trenchant passages of the draft communique. 
Gallego informed the KGB that the left-wing daily Pueblo 
planned to send a correspondent to Moscow to interview 
Soviet dissidents. Thus forewarned, the Madrid embassy 
refused the correspondent a visa.^^ 

With the restoration of parliamentary democracy for the 
first time since the Spanish Civil War, the PCE was 



widely expected — not least by Carrillo — to achieve as 
dominant a position on the left in Spain as the PCI had in 
Italy. Its socialist rival, the PSOE, had adapted itself less 
well both to underground opposition to the autocratic 
Franco regime and to maintaining party organization 
during almost forty years of exile. In the 35-year-old 
Felipe Gonzalez, however, the socialists had a dynamic, 
telegenic leader whose youthful appeal to voters was far 
more effective than Carrillo’s. During the campaign for 
the parliamentary elections of June 1977 the PCE also 
found it more difficult than the PSOE to free itself of an 
extremist image. To Moscow’s satisfaction, Carrillo’s 
Eurocommunist campaign was at least mildly disrupted 
by the return from the Soviet Union in May of the 83- 
year-old president of the PCE, Dolores Ibarruri, whom 
Carrillo had succeeded as general secretary almost twenty 
years earlier. Known as La Pasionaria (“passion flower”), 
Ibarruri had been the most charismatic orator of the Civil 
War, famous around the world for her cries of defiance in 
the face of fascism: “Better to die on your feet than live 
on your knees!”; “Better to be the widow of a hero than 
the wife of a coward!” Franco’s supporters spread rumors 
that she had once cut a priest’s throat with her own 
teeth.^^ Though Ibarruri’ s appearances during the 1977 
election campaign were limited by her age and weak 
heart, she lost no opportunity to praise the achievements 
of the Soviet Bloc — “countries where socialism is being 
built.” Carrillo tried to dilute the impact of her speeches 



by implying that she was out of touch and bound to the 
Soviet Union by the death of her only son while fighting 
for the Red Army at Stalingrad. 

At the parliamentary elections of June 1977, the first 
free elections in Spain for forty-one years, the electorate 
rejected the extremes of both left and right. The PCE won 
only 9 percent of the vote, as compared with the 34 
percent of Suarez’s Union of the Democratic Centre and 
the 28 percent of the socialists. Among the new 
Communist deputies was Gallego, who became deputy 
chairman of the PCE parliamentary group. Believing 
Carrillo’s position to be much weaker than Berlinguer’s, 
the Kremlin tried to rally opposition to him in the PCE. 
Shortly after the election, the Moscow New Times 
published a vituperative review of Carrillo’s 
''Eurocommunism'" and the State. Carrillo, it declared, 
might appear to be talking simply about differences in 
tactics and strategy between different Communist Parties, 
but his real views were “exactly those of the imperialist 
adversaries of Communism.”^^ The CPSU International 
Department drafted an attack on Carrillo’s revisionism, 
then arranged for its publication under the signatures of 
three members of the PCE. A letter containing a similar 
attack, signed by 200 Spanish Communists, was 
circulated as a leaflet.^ ^ 

During 1978 the public controversy between the PCE 
and CPSU died down. In private, however, Carrillo was 
more critical than ever. According to a report from 



Gallego forwarded by the Madrid residency, he 
condemned the Soviet Union in one off-the-record 
outburst as “a semi-feudal state, dominated by a 
privileged bureaucracy which is cut off from the people,” 
with a far less democratic way of life than the United 
States. After the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan at the 
end of 1979, Carrillo made some of his criticisms public. 
In January 1980 he wrote to the CPSU Central Committee 
attacking the invasion as political adventurism and 
blaming Soviet as well as American policy for the 
intensification of the Cold War.^^ Though some local 
Party organizations supported Soviet intervention, 
Carrillo was backed by a majority of the PCE executive. 
Gallego, meanwhile, continued to receive about 30,000 
dollars a year from the KGB.^^ The Madrid resident, 
Viktor Mikhailovich Filippov, reported that though 
Gallego stuck “as far as possible” to the political line 
recommended by the residency, there was little he could 
do to galvanize open opposition without isolating himself 
on the executive. In Filippov’s view, Carrillo remained in 
firm control of his party.^^ In reality, tom between 
Furocommunists and hardliners, and with the Catalan 
Communists losing faith in Carrillo’s leadership, the PCE 
had begun to disintegrate.^^ 

There were also divisions within the socialists as Felipe 
Gonzalez tried to turn the PSOE into a social democratic 
party. After a party congress in May 1979 reaffirmed the 



Marxist nature of the PSOE, Gonzalez resigned, only to 
return in triumph four months later when an extraordinary 
party congress recognized the non-Marxist as well as 
Marxist “contributions which have helped to make 
socialism the great alternative for emancipation of our 
time.” In the 1982 parliamentary elections the PSOE won 
a sweeping victory. With Gonzalez as prime minister, the 
socialists dominated Spanish politics for the next decade. 
Support for the PCE, meanwhile, was dwindling away. In 
1982 it gained only 3.8 percent of the vote — down from 
10.5 percent in 1979. Carrillo was forced to resign as 
general secretary, to be succeeded by Gerardo Iglesias. 
According to Gonzalez, “Carrillo managed to accomplish 
in record time what Franco could not do in forty years of 
the dictatorship. He has dismembered the Communist 
Party in Spain.” 

Moscow also placed much of the blame for the collapse 
of PCE support on Carrillo personally, though its analysis 
differed from that of Gonzalez. A book by the Tass 
journalist Anatoli Krasikov claimed that Carrillo’s 
Eurocommunism and rejection of Marxism — Leninism 
had led the Party into “sharp internal strife” and electoral 
disaster: “Large numbers of activists, including very 
prominent ones who had struggled against Francoism and 
fought for the democratization of the country, were driven 
out of the Party.”^^ In a secret report preserved in KGB 
archives, Boris Ponomarev, the head of the international 
department, declared early in 1983 that there was no 



prospect of a PCE revival so long as Carrillo or his 
proteges retained influence in it.^^ 

In January 1984 Moscow supported, and probably 
financed, the foundation by Gallego of a breakaway 
Partido Comunista de los Pueblos de Espaha. Pravda 
welcomed Gallego ’s denunciation of Eurocommunism 
and his announcement that the new party would be an 
“integral part” of the international Communist 
movement.^^ The PCPE, however, never became more 
than a splinter party. In 1986 the rump of the PCE merged 
with two smaller left-wing parties to form the Izquierda 
Unida (United Left). 

THE THIRD OF the main Eurocommunist parties in the 
mid-1970s was the PCE (Parti Communiste Fran^ais), led 
by Georges Marchais, who had previously made a 
reputation as an uncompromising Stalinist. In 1957 he 
shouted angrily at a Party militant who dared to express 
doubts about Stalin’s purges and the Soviet suppression of 
the Hungarian Uprising: “Yes, [the Soviets] arrested 
people, they imprisoned people! Well, I tell you they 
didn’t arrest enough! They didn’t imprison enough! If 
they had been tougher and more vigilant they wouldn’t 
have got into the situation they find themselves in now!” 
Francois Mitterrand once complained, “Insult is 
[Marchais ’s] way of saying hello. 

As Marchais consolidated his power in the PCE as 



deputy general secretary in 1970 and general secretary 
two years later, the Centre grew increasingly suspicious 
of him. Despite his early Soviet loyalism, the KGB 
reported to the Central Committee in March 1976 that, 
according to its informants in “circles close to Marchais,” 
he had been gradually moving away from “the principles 
of proletarian internationalism” for some time. The 
KGB’s chief informant on Eurocommunist tendencies 
inside the PCF was Marchais ’s second-in-command, 
Gaston Plissonier, who had assisted Soviet intelligence 
operations since at least the early 1950s.^^ Like his fellow 
Soviet loyalists in Italy and in Spain, Plissonnier was also 
the main conduit for Moscow’s secret subsidies to the 
PCF.^2 

In June 1972 the PCF formed an electoral alliance and 
agreed a “common program of government” with the 
socialists and left-wing radicals. A few months later, 
according to the KGB, Marchais told his closest 
associates (doubtless including Plissonnier) that he 
condemned both the invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 
and the continuing persecution of dissidents within the 
Soviet Union. Marchais was also deeply irritated by the 
Kremlin’s apparent benevolence towards France’s 
Gaullist governments, which, he claimed, “hampered the 
French Communist Party’s revolutionary struggle.” Since 
President de Gaulle had withdrawn France from the 
integrated NATO command in 1966, Moscow had seen 
Gaullism as potentially a more disruptive force in western 



Europe than a left-wing French government, even one 
which included Communists. Marchais tried to persuade 
the Kremlin that its assessment was mistaken. In 1972, 
doubtless intending his warning to be passed on to 
Moscow, he secretly threatened the East German leader, 
Erich Honecker: 

If the Socialist countries [the Soviet Bloc] do not 
take account of the French Communist Party’s 
warning that the French government is shifting 
towards Atlantic [pro-American] positions, and if 
they do not give the Party the proper assistance in the 
struggle to overthrow the regime, they would be 
faced with a refusal by the French Communist Party 
to support their policy, as happened at the time of the 
Czechoslovak events [in 1968]. 

Publicly, the Kremlin appeared to pay little heed. Before 
the second round of the 1974 French presidential 
elections, the Soviet ambassador called on the neo- 
Gaullist candidate, Valery Giscard d’Estaing, apparently 
implying that Moscow favored his election rather than 
that of Mitterrand, who had PCF support.^^ Behind the 
scenes, however, the KGB was engaged in active 
measures aimed — ^unsuccessfully — at securing Giscard’ s 
defeat. 

At the beginning of 1976 Marchais privately rebuked 
the PCF newspaper, L'Humanite, for failing to send a 



correspondent to meet the exiled Russian dissident, 
Leonid Plyushch, on his arrival in Paris after being freed 
from incarceration in a Soviet mental hospital. The Centre 
interpreted Marchais’s gradual move towards 
Eurocommunism less in terms of ideological evolution 
than personal ambition. Even Berlinguer was reported by 
the KGB as criticizing Marchais for his narrow 
nationalism and comparing him to the Romanian autocrat 
Nicola Ceau§escu. The Centre concluded that Marchais 
would stop at nothing to satisfy his personal vanity. 

The KGB reported to the Central Committee that it was 
not until the Twentysecond Congress of the PCF in 
February 1976 that Marchais felt sufficiently confident of 
support for his increasingly heretical views within the 
Party hierarchy to dare to express them openly, despite 
the opposition of Plissonnier.^^ The congress adopted an 
ambitious Eurocommunist agenda. Marchais took the lead 
in rejecting the traditional aim of a “dictatorship of the 
proletariat,” in criticizing the “limitations on democracy” 
in the Soviet Bloc and in committing the PCF to “a 
democratic road to socialism” which would “foster the 
free expression of many trends of thought.” To 
scandalized Soviet loyalists within the PCF, the new 
Eurocommunist platform seemed to “legalize counter- 
revolution.”^^ Over the next eighteen months the CPSU 
Central Committee sent three angry letters to the PCF 
complaining about its policies. Behind the scenes the 



KGB accompanied such irate correspondence with active 
measures. Among them was operation YEVROPA, begun 
in 1977 and based on forged CIA documents which 
purported to reveal an American plot to destroy the unity 
of the PCF. The Centre hoped that YEVROPA would set 
some of the Central Committee against Marchais, 
presumably by implying that he was playing into the 
hands of the CIA.^^ 

The KGB, however, had misjudged the strength of 
Marchais ’s ideological deviations. The PCF’s 
Eurocommunist flirtation had been part of the price it had 
paid for the alliance with the socialists. The flirtation 
ended in the summer of 1977 after it became clear that, 
instead of confirming the Communists as the largest party 
on the French left, it had led to them being overtaken by 
the socialists. In September 1977 the left-wing alliance 
collapsed amid mutual recriminations. Thereafter 
Marchais and the PCF Central Committee gradually 
returned to an increasingly uncritical Soviet loyalism.^^ In 
October 1978 the Centre cancelled an active measure 
devised by the Paris residency to drive a wedge between 
the PCF and PCI, probably because it was no longer 
considered necessary.^^ 

The KGB report on Marchais submitted to the Central 
Committee in March 1976 reported that he had hanging 
over him the exposure of his war record. Marchais had 
claimed in 1970 that he had been “requisitioned” in 



December 1942 to work in a German factory at Lipheim 
building Messerschmitt fighter aircraft, but had escaped in 
January 1943 and returned to France. The Centre, 
however, claimed to know “from reliable sources” that the 
French authorities had documents showing that, far from 
being forced to work in Germany, he had signed a 
voluntary contract for a job at Lipheim. The KGB report 
on Marchais was so hostile that in 1976 it may well have 
contemplated using his war record to discredit him, just as 
it hoped to use Berlinguer’s allegedly shady building 
contracts to destroy his reputation. It is unclear, 
however, whether the KGB did anything to bring to light 
a document, which was published in 1977 by Auguste 
Lecoeur, a former member of the PCF Politburo, and the 
right-wing weekly Minute, showing that Marchais had 
voluntarily accepted work in the Messerschmitt factory. 
Marchais claimed that the document was forged and 
brought a libel suit against both Lecoeur and Minute. At 
the opening of the trial in September 1977 he burst into 
tears. He lost both that case and another libel suit in the 
following year. In March 1980 L' Express published a 
wartime German document which appeared to show not 
merely that Marchais had gone voluntarily to work in 
Germany but that he had stayed there until 1944. On this 
occasion Marchais did not sue but maintained his 
innocence, declaring that he was the victim of an 
improbable plot by his rivals in the 1981 presidential 
elections: “That is why, at the origin of this calumny. 



there have been successively discovered close 
collaborators of Giscard d’Estaing, of Chirac, and of 
Francois Mitterrand. 

The PCF entered the 1980s in a mood of unswerving 
loyalty to Moscow. No other leader of a major Western 
Communist Party matched the zeal with which Marchais 
defended the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in December 
1979. Two years later the PCF sycophantically greeted 
the outlawing of Solidarity and the declaration of a state 
of emergency in Poland as a “triumph” for the Polish 
Communist Party. At the same time, however, the PCF 
was in steep electoral decline. In the 1981 presidential 
election Marchais gained only 15 percent of the vote — 
easily the Party’s worst result since the Second World 
War. In 1986 the PCF vote fell even more precipitously, 
to 6.8 percent, in the parliamentary elections. 

THE GORBACHEV ERA brought a sea change in the 
CPSU’s relations with foreign Communist Parties. The 
PCF and Moscow’s other most faithful Western followers 
were increasingly outraged to discover that their loyalism 
was no longer appreciated. Gorbachev himself appeared 
far more interested in imaginative heresy than in 
intellectually sclerotic orthodoxy. Eurocommunism 
seemed to have conquered the Kremlin. As head of the 
CPSU delegation to Berlinguer’s funeral in June 1984, 
Gorbachev was deeply impressed by the spontaneous 
outpouring of grief by a million and a half mourners 



crowded into Rome’s Piazza San Giovanni. One of the 
first signs of his “new thinking” when he became CPSU 
general secretary in March 1985 was the fact that the only 
European Communist leader included in his meetings 
with world statesmen after Chernenko’s funeral was 
Berlinguer’s successor, Alessandro Natta. Ponomarev was 
visibly shocked. How could it be, he asked his colleagues 
in the international department, that despite the presence 
of so many leaders of “good” Communist Parties in 
Moscow, Gorbachev had bestowed his favor instead on 
the general secretary of the “bad” PCI?^^ 

Over the next five years Gorbachev repeatedly 
conferred with PCI leaders, praised their policies and used 
them as sounding boards for his “new thinking” on social 
democracy and East- West relations. In Spain Gorbachev 
showed far less interest in the tattered remnants of the 
PCE^^ than in the ruling Socialist Party. Gorbachev’s 
press secretary, Andrei Grachev, once asked him which 
foreign politician he felt closest to. Gorbachev’s reply was 
unhesitating: Felipe Gonzalez. According to Grachev, 
Gorbachev “did not just appreciate ‘Felipe,’ he loved 
him.”^i 

Dependence on secret Soviet subsidies, however, 
persuaded some of the affronted hardline foreign 
Communist leaders to swallow their pride. In June 1987, 
Marchais sent a groveling message to Gorbachev 
conveying his “deepest gratitude” for meeting him in May 



and asking for “emergency financial aid” of 10 million 
francs (1.65 million dollars) to prepare for the 1988 
presidential elections. Noting that the PCF had already 
received 2 million dollars during 1987, the Politburo none 
the less agreed to supply another million via the KGB.^^ 
For Gus Hall, the hardline leader of the ever- faithful 
CPUS A, Gorbachev’s “new thinking” proved too much in 
the end. Goaded for the first time in his career into open 
disagreement with Moscow, he launched a public attack 
on Gorbachev’s reforms in 1989, only for his secret 
Soviet subsidies to be abruptly cut off. The impact on the 
CPUS A was devastating. Plunged into an immediate 
financial crisis, it was forced in 1990 first to cut the 
publication of the Party newspaper, the People's Daily 
World, from five to two days a week, then to turn it into a 
weekly. Armando Cossutta spoke for many traditional 
Moscow loyalists in Western Communist Parties when he 
declared his disgust after the failure of the August 1991 
Moscow coup that “the term ‘Communism’ is now a dirty 
word even in the land of Lenin.”^^ 



NINETEEN 


IDEOLOGICAL SUBVERSION 


Part 1: The War Against the Dissidents 


Soviet “dissidents” made their first public appearance on 
Constitution Day (December 5) 1965, when a group of 
about two hundred organized a demonstration in Pushkin 
Square, Moscow, in support of the authors Andrei 
Sinyavsky and Yuli Daniel, who were shortly to go on 
trial accused of attempting to subvert the Soviet system 
through their writings. Some of the demonstrators briefly 
succeeded in unfurling banners reading “Respect the 
Constitution!” and “We Demand an Open Trial for 
Sinyavsky and Daniel!”, before being frogmarched to the 
police station by plain clothes members of the KGB. 
Henceforth the term used to describe democratic and 
human rights activists in the Soviet Union was the 
English word “dissidents” rather than its Russian 



equivalent inakomysliashchii — ^probably as part of an 
official attempt to portray such people as stooges of the 
West rather than as the authentic voice of Russian 
protest. ^ 

The KGB had been unusually slow to track the two 
writers down. Sinyavsky, using the pseudonym “Abram 
Tertz,” had begun publishing his work in the West, 
initially in Paris, in 1959. His friend Daniel, employing 
the alias “Nikolai Arzhak,” had followed suit in 1961. 
After extensive analysis of the publications of “Tertz” and 
“Arzhak” by Soviet writers and literary critics who were 
KGB agents and co-optees, opinion in the Centre was 
divided on their real identity. One school of thought 
claimed that the intimate knowledge of Moscow life 
displayed by both authors showed that they were living in 
the Soviet Union and had smuggled their work abroad for 
publication. This view was supported by the Paris 
residency, which forwarded a report that the manuscript 
for “Tertz’ s” book. The Trial Begins {Sud Idyot), had 
reached France from Moscow. Others within the Centre 
sided with literary analysts who argued that 
“inaccuracies” in the authors’ depiction of Moscow life 
showed that they were living in the West, and cited other 
(mistaken) KGB reports that both “Tertz” and “Arzhak” 
were living in western Europe.^ The KGB was further 
confused by the fact that Sinyavsky used a Jewish 
pseudonym, thus giving rise to the mistaken belief that he 
was Jewish himself. The official Soviet press later 



denounced the choice of pseudonym as “a squalid 
provocation.” According to a writer in Izvestia: 

By publishing anti-Soviet tales under the name of 
Abram Tertz in foreign publications, Sinyavsky was 
attempting to create the impression that anti- 
Semitism exists in our country and that a writer with 
a name such as Abram Tertz has to seek publishers 
in the West if he wants to write “frankly” about 
Soviet life.^ 

After several years’ fruitless surveillance of the wrong 
writers, a KGB agent in the Moscow literary world, 
codenamed YEFIMOV, reported early in 1964 that an 
author named Yuli Daniel was in possession of “anti- 
Soviet material.” Simultaneously the KGB in Yalta sent a 
report from another agent who claimed that Daniel had 
the manuscript of “a story for which he could be given 
fifteen years’ imprisonment.” The surveillance of Daniel 
quickly led the KGB to Sinyavsky. In May 1964 the 
Centre began operation EPIGONI to obtain proof that 
Sinyavsky and Daniel were the authors of the “anti- 
Soviet” volumes published in the West, to discover where 
they kept their manuscripts and find out how they 
smuggled them out of the Soviet Union. The KGB 
arranged for Sinyavsky’ s employer, the Gorky Institute of 
World Literature, to send him on a business trip away 
from Moscow. During his absence it conducted a detailed 



search of his flat and installed bugging devices. Searching 
and bugging Daniel’s apartment proved to be more 
difficult. His tworoom flat with shared kitchen at 85 
Leninsky Prospekt was reported to be “constantly 
occupied by his family, a friend and a dog.” Eventually, a 
KGB officer, posing as the relative of a neighbor, 
succeeded in staying in the flat, taking wax impressions of 
the keys and creating an opportunity for a detailed 
search.^ 

It took over a year for operation EPIGONI to achieve 
significant results. Though the KGB lacked proof, it 
correctly concluded that Sinyavsky’s first attempts to 
smuggle his work to the West had been assisted by 
Helane Zamoyska, the daughter of a former French naval 
attache, whom he had met while she was studying at 
Moscow University.^ In the summer of 1965 the KGB 
intercepted a letter to Sinyavsky, signed “Alfreda” but 
giving no return address, inviting him to meet her at the 
Hotel Bucharest in Moscow. Having discovered that 
“Alfreda” was Alfreda Aucouturier, a friend of Heclane 
Zamoyska, the KGB hoped to catch Sinyavsky in the act 
of handing over a manuscript to her. Sinyavsky and 
Daniel were both placed under 24-hour surveillance and a 
“special operational group” was formed to catch Madame 
Aucouturier redhanded. Despite bugging a visit made by 
Madame Aucouturier to Sinyavsky’s flat and filming a 
later meeting between them near the Rechnoy Vokzal 
metro station, the group failed to detect any manuscript 



being handed over. It was disappointed again when it 
searched Madame Aucouturier’s luggage at the Russo- 
Polish frontier on September 8.^ A long interrogation also 
failed to produce results. The KGB’s unsuccessful 
attempts to persuade Aucouturier to admit that “Tertz’s” 
real name was Sinyavsky merely made her realize how 
thin their evidence was against him.^ 

Shortly after Madame Aucouturier was allowed to 
leave Russia, Sinyavsky and Daniel were arrested and 
taken to Lefortovo prison in Moscow. Under interrogation 
both confessed that they had published works under 
pseudonyms in the West, but denied that they were anti- 
Soviet. They also refused to admit that Madame 
Zamoyska had smuggled their manuscripts out of Russia. 
According to surveillance reports before their arrest, 
Sinyavsky and Daniel had been suspicious of all new 
acquaintances, sensibly fearing that they might be KGB 
agents. In Lefortovo prison, however, Sinyavsky fell for 
one of the oldest deceptions in the KGB’s repertoire. A 
stoolpigeon codenamed MIKHAILOV (probably the 
illegal Geli Fyodorovich Vasilyev) ^ was introduced into 
his cell and succeeded in gaining his confidence. Before 
MIKHAILOV’S “release” in November, Sinyavsky asked 
him to pass on a series of signs and passwords to his wife 
to enable her to communicate secretly with him during 
prison visits. MIKHAILOV’S information and 
surveillance of Sinyavskaya’s meetings with her husband 



provided what the EPIGONI file describes as “invaluable 
material relating to Sinyavsky’s contacts.” The most 
important of these contacts was Andrei Remizov, head 
librarian at the Moscow Library of Foreign Literature.^ 
Remizov confessed during interrogation that, under the 
pseudonym “Ivanov,” he had published in the West the 
play Is There life on Mars? and the essay “American 
Pangs of the Russian Conscience,” which had appeared in 
Encounter magazine in 1964.^^ He also admitted that, 
during a visit to France, he had delivered one of 
Sinyavsky’s manuscripts to Helene Zamoyska.^^ The 
KGB seems to have planned originally to put Remizov on 
trial with Sinyavsky and Daniel. When Remizov became 
suicidal, however, the plan changed. It was decided 
instead to use Remizov primarily as a prosecution witness 
against Sinyavsky and Daniel. His own case was treated 
separately and he was placed under 24-hour suicide 
watch. To prevent further contact with the wives of 
Sinyavsky and Daniel, who were trying to persuade him 
not to give evidence, Remizov was sent on official 
business by the Ministry of Culture to Kursk and Tula, 
where he remained on suicide watch until the trial. 
Surveillance of Daniel’s wife showed that she was 
collecting a dossier of material for publication in the West 
before the trial. The KGB successfully planted on her an 
illegal posing as a sympathetic Western businessman who 
delivered the dossier not to the West but to the KGB.^^ 



Though many Soviet writers had been persecuted for 
unorthodox opinions without due legal process, 
Sinyavsky and Daniel were the first to be put on trial 
simply for what they had written. The trial in February 
1966 was officially a public one, with both defendants 
being granted their “full rights.” As the New York Herald 
Tribune observed, “These rights included the right to be 
laughed at by a hand-picked audience of 70 persons ... 
[and] the right to have only the prosecution side of the 
case reported in some detail to those who cannot claim 
access to the “open” trial because they have no passes. 
The stage-managed proceedings were, however, spoiled 
by the failure of the defendants to play the roles allotted to 
them. Against all the traditions of Soviet show trials, 
Sinyavsky and Daniel refused either to admit guilt or to 
show contrition. 

Despite the sycophantic audience, the prosecution was 
visibly disconcerted by the courageous and articulate 
defendants. Sinyavsky exposed the elementary confusion 
in a prosecution case which identified the opinions of 
fictional characters with those of their authors. He was 
also able to refer to the bugging of his flat before he was 
interrupted in mid-sentence.^^ The state prosecutor, 
undeterred either by his own mental confusion or by his 
uncertain grasp of the law,^^ concluded with an absurdly 
melodramatic denunciation of the two authors’ work: 
“They pour mud on whatever is most holy, most pure — 



love, friendship, motherhood. Their women are either 
monsters or bitches. Their men are debauched.” But the 
most serious crime committed by Sinyavsky and Daniel 
was that of ideological subversion: 

The social danger of their work, of what they have 
done, is particularly acute at this time, when 
ideological warfare is being stepped up, when the 
entire propaganda machine of international reaction, 
connected as it is with the intelligence services, is 
being brought into play to contaminate our youth 
with the poison of nihilism, to get its tentacles into 
our intellectual circles by hook or by crook 

Sinyavsky was sentenced to seven years in a labor camp, 
Daniel to five. 

The promised official transcript of the trial never 
appeared — a sure sign of the weakness of the prosecution 
case. An unofficial transcript, however, assembled by 
supporters of the defendants, was published in the West. 
To penetrate the dissidents who had come together in 
support of Sinyavsky and Daniel, the Centre selected two 
illegals in their late twenties, Anatoli Andreyevich 
Tonkonog (code-named TANOV) and his wife Yelena 
Timofeyevna Fyodorova (TANOVA). Tonkonog reported 
that the sale of the transcripts of the trial of Sinyavsky and 
Daniel in the West had been organized by an 
entrepreneurial KGB agent, Nikolai Vasilyevich 



Dyakonov (codenamed GOGOL), who had worked for 
the Novosti Press Agency in the United States and other 
Western countries. According to one of Tonkonog’s 
informants, Dyakonov was “a real wheeler-dealer” who 
dealt in foreign currency and sold Russian abstract 
paintings and unpublished literary works to Western 
buyers. 

Though the KGB evidently considered that the 
prosecution of Dyakonov would be too embarrassing, 
after a long investigation it put on trial in January 1968 
four young dissidents who had compiled the transcript 
and other documents concerning the trial of Sinyavsky 
and Daniel: Aleksandr Ginzburg, Yuri Galanskov, Alexei 
Dobrovolsky and Vera Lashkova. Ginzburg and 
Galanskov had for some years taken leading roles in the 
production of samizdat journals. Their trial proceeded in 
much the same manner as that of Sinyavsky and Daniel. 
The courtroom audience was, once again, picked by the 
KGB and the defense was prevented from calling most of 
its witnesses. The two principal defendants, Ginzburg and 
Galanskov, again refused to contribute to the success of 
their own show trial and were sentenced to five and seven 
years in labor camp respectively. Emboldened by the 
courage of the defendants and the interest of the Western 
media, Daniel’s wife, Larisa Bogoraz, and a fellow 
dissident, Pavel Litvinov, issued an impassioned 
denunciation of the conduct of the trial to foreign 
correspondents, with a request “that it be published and 



broadcast by radio as soon as possible. Tonkonog later 
reported that the small demonstration in Red Square in 
August 1968 against Soviet military intervention in 
Czechoslovakia was also organized by Larisa Bogoraz. 
On this occasion Litvinov and other dissidents tried to 
dissuade her, but ten of them joined her when she insisted 
on going ahead. The KGB inevitably broke up the 
demonstration and arrested the demonstrators.^^ 

THUS FAR THE writer who most concerned the Soviet 
authorities, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, codenamed PAUK 
(“Spider”) by the KGB,^^ had escaped arrest. 
Solzhenitsyn had been saved in part by his celebrity. The 
labor camp novel One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich, 
which changed him almost overnight from an obscure 
provincial teacher of mathematics and physics into a 
world-renowned author, had been published in 1962 with 
the personal blessing of Khrushchev. During a sweep of 
Moscow dissidents shortly after the arrest of Sinyavsky 
and Daniel in September 1965, the KGB had discovered 
and confiscated manuscripts which Solzhenitsyn had left 
for safekeeping at the home of a friend. The KGB 
reported to the Central Committee that the manuscripts 
provided proof that “Solzhenitsyn indulges in politically 
damaging statements and disseminates slanderous 
fabrications.” Both the KGB chairman, Vladimir 
Semichastny, and the Public Prosecutor, Roman Rudenko, 



were, however, uncertain how to proceed against such a 
celebrated writer, and simply referred Solzhenitsyn’s 
manuscripts to the Writers’ Union, which did not supply 
the denunciation expected of it for another eighteen 
months. By the time the Central Committee considered 
the matter in March 1967, Solzhenitsyn had sent his latest 
novel. Cancer Ward, to the West and had almost finished 
The Gulag Archipelago, his epic study of the labor camps. 
Within the Central Committee, the initiative in calling for 
“decisive measures” to deal with Solzhenitsyn’s “anti- 
Soviet activities” came from Andropov, who succeeded 
Semichastny as KGB chairman in the summer of 1967.^^ 
For the remaining seventeen years of his life, Andropov 
remained the dissidents’ most determined opponent 
within the Soviet leadership. First-hand involvement in 
crushing the Hungarian uprising, reinforced by second- 
hand experience of the Prague Spring during his first year 
as KGB chairman, convinced him that one of the chief 
threats to the Soviet Bloc was Western-sponsored 
ideological subversion: 

The enemy gives direct and indirect support to 
counter-revolutionary elements, engages in 
ideological sabotage, establishes all sorts of anti- 
Socialist, anti-Soviet and other hostile organizations 
and seeks to fan the flames of nationalism. Graphic 
confirmation of this is provided by the events in 
Czechoslovakia ... ^^ 



In the wake of the Prague Spring, Andropov set up a new 
KGB Fifth Directorate to monitor and crack down on 
dissent in all its forms. Specialized departments within the 
directorate were responsible for the surveillance of 
intellectuals, students, nationalists from ethnic minorities, 
religious believers and Jews.^^ 

Solzhenitsyn increasingly became one of Andropov’s 
personal obsessions. The announcement in October 1970 
that the great subversive had won the Nobel Prize for 
Literature prompted the KGB chairman to submit to the 
Politburo a memorandum, also signed by Rudenko, 
enclosing a draft decree to deprive Solzhenitsyn of his 
citizenship and expel him from the Soviet Union: 

When analyzing the materials on Solzhenitsyn and 
his works, one cannot fail to arrive at the conclusion 
that we are dealing with a political opponent of the 
Soviet state and social system ... If Solzhenitsyn 
continues to reside in the country after receiving the 
Nobel Prize, it will strengthen his position, and allow 
him to propagandize his views more actively.^^ 

Andropov, however, did not persuade a majority of the 
Politburo. Brezhnev showed more sympathy for the 
contrary views of his crony, Nikolai Shchelokov, the 
interior minister, who argued in the autumn of 1971 that 
Solzhenitsyn needed to be won over, not persecuted: 



“One of the higher-ups needs to sit down and talk with 
him, to remove the bitter taste that persecution has, no 
doubt, left in his mouth.” Brezhnev underlined — 
apparently approvingly — a series of comments in a 
memorandum by Shchelokov which must have been 
anathema to Andropov: 

In resolving the Solzhenitsyn question we must 
analyze past mistakes made in dealing with people in 
the arts ... The “Solzhenitsyn Problem” was created 
by literary administrators who should have known 
better ... In this case what needs to be done is not to 
execute our enemies publicly but smother them with 
embraces. 

Henceforth Shchelokov, so far as Andropov was 
concerned, was a marked man. After Brezhnev’s death he 
was charged by Andropov with corruption but committed 
suicide before going on trial.^^ 

In the autumn of 1971, however, Andropov knew better 
than to attack openly opinions approved by Brezhnev. But 
he was not prepared to give up. In March 1972 Andropov 
made a further attempt to persuade the Politburo to expel 
Solzhenitsyn from the Soviet Union, providing further 
“indisputable” evidence that “he was deliberately and 
irrevocably embarked on the path of struggle with the 
Soviet government and will wage this struggle regardless 
of everything.” Though agreeing that Solzhenitsyn was “a 



true degenerate,” the Politburo — doubtless to Andropov’s 
extreme displeasure — was still not willing to send him 
into exile.^^ 

THE OTHER DISSIDENT who most obsessed Andropov 
from the early 1970s onwards was the nuclear physicist 
and Academician Andrei Sakharov, codenamed ASKET 
(“Ascetic”) by the KGB, “father” of the Soviet H-bomb 
and three times Hero of Socialist Labor. Though out of 
favor with the scientific establishment, he retained an 
official dacha in Zhukovka as well as his flat in Moscow. 
Late in 1970, Sakharov and two fellow physicists, Valeri 
Chalidze and Andrei Tverdokhlebov, founded the 
Committee for Human Rights and persuaded Solzhenitsyn 
to become a corresponding (though not very active) 
member.^^ Like Solzhenitsyn, Sakharov’s international 
stature made it difficult for the KGB to persecute him as 
freely as less well-known dissidents. His KGB file makes 
the absurd claim that Sakharov “used his authority to 
influence the decisions of the judiciary and create a 
hullabaloo around the trials of anti-social elements” such 
as Vladimir Bukovsky, put on trial in January 1972 for 
compiling evidence about the committal of himself and 
other dissidents to mental hospitals. The real burden of 
the KGB complaint was that Sakharov and his committee 
had some modest success in limiting, though not in 
preventing, the abuse of the legal process. 



In October 1972 the 37-year-old illegal Georgi 
Ivanovich Kotlyar, codenamed BERTRAND, succeeded 
in winning Sakharov’s confidence and establishing what 
the Centre considered a “trusted relationship” with him 
and his wife Elena Bonner. Kotlyar had been bom in 
France and succeeded in passing himself off as one 
“Alain Boucaut,” a French archaeologist who had been 
working in Mexico for the past decade. His success in 
maintaining his cover and providing intelligence on 
Sakharov and Bonner won him high praise from both 
Filipp Denisovich Bobkov, head of the Fifth Directorate, 
and his deputy, Nikashin.^^ Attempts were also made to 
plant agents on Solzhenitsyn, among them the pianist 
Miroka Kokomaya (transparently codenamed MIROKA), 
who regularly went on concert tours abroad. A KGB 
operation in 1973 to persuade Solzhenitsyn to use 
MIROKA as a courier to the West failed.^ ^ 

In the summer of 1973 the KGB at last succeeded in 
staging what it considered a successful show trial, during 
which the defendants incriminated themselves in the best 
Stalinist tradition, and other dissidents were duly 
demoralized. The victims of this traditional travesty of 
Soviet justice were Pyotr Yakir and Viktor Krasin, 
leading members of the group which produced the 
samizdat Chronicle of Current Events. Yakir was the son 
of an army commander shot during the Great Terror, and 
had spent much of his life in prison. At the time of his 
arrest in June 1972, he was known by other dissidents to 



be close to breaking point and drinking heavily. After the 
trial of Bukovsky, the KGB had overheard him saying, “I 
can’t take it any more. I couldn’t face another sentence 
myself — I haven’t the strength.” Before his arrest, Yakir 
circulated a statement saying that any confession 
extracted from him in jail should be disregarded. 
Though exhausted by many years of persecution, Yakir 
somehow found the strength to resist during the early 
stages of his interrogation before finally breaking under 
prolonged pressure. In the brutally triumphant words of 
his chief interrogator, “He began to assess his actions and 
the contents of the anti-Soviet literature which he had 
distributed fairly objectively and politically correctly.” 
Yakir was finally persuaded to put his signature to a 
formulaic KGB-dictated confession: 

In the course of the investigation, I have come to 
understand that I committed a whole series of 
criminal acts: I have signed letters with a defamatory 
content which asserted that in our country people are 
sentenced for their beliefs; I have given a number of 
interviews to foreign correspondents which 
contained slanderous assertions; I kept, duplicated 
and distributed documents of similar content; and I 
frequently passed tendentious information to foreign 
correspondents who used this for propaganda 
purposes. 

Having grasped the seriousness of what I have 



done, I sincerely repent. Not only will I not do this 
again in the future, but I shall do my utmost to 
influence people who are close to me and to 
demonstrate the error of their positions. 

The breaking of Krasin under interrogation caused 
much greater surprise in dissident circles than that of 
Yakir. According to his KGB file, “[Krasin] stood out 
because of the particularly hostile attitude to the Soviet 
system which he had adopted in his youth, his 
stubbornness and consistency in his work, and his 
readiness to see things through to the end, regardless of 
the obstacles.” He was co-author of the samizdat Legal 
Instructions, which advised all those summoned for 
interrogation by the KGB to refuse to answer questions. 
On seven occasions between 1968 and 1972 when he 
himself had been questioned by the KGB, Krasin had 
faithfully followed his own advice. After prolonged 
surveillance, however, the Fifth Directorate concluded 
that a “polite and calm” interrogation with “absolutely no 
sneering,” combined with a sympathetic stoolpigeon in 
his cell, would eventually wear down his resistance. 
Krasin was known to be willing to disagree with other 
dissidents, and during 1971-2 had become increasingly 
despondent about their prospects. There were, he said, 
“few defenders at the final barricades. 

As expected, Krasin began his lengthy interrogation in 
defiant mood. When his interrogator, Lieutenant-Colonel 



Pavel Aleksandrovsky, asked, “Why do you refuse to say 
what you have been doing if you do not consider it 
criminal?” Krasin replied, “I do not consider it criminal, 
but you do. Therefore, if I were to tell you, I would be 
giving you incriminating material which I do not want to 
do.” The first breach in Krasin’s defenses was made by 
the KGB agent in his cell, who pretended that he had been 
arrested for dealing in foreign currency and appealed for 
Krasin’s advice on how to face the charges against him. 
Instead of simply telling him not to answer questions, 
Krasin showed him how to frame the best defense during 
his interrogation. Full of praise for Krasin’s knowledge of 
the criminal code, the stoolpigeon then urged him to 
follow his own advice and challenge the charges against 
him: 


You are very clever. Fancy knowing the law so well! 
You can stand up to any interrogator. It would be 
impossible to trick you or frighten you! If you can 
prove that what you did was not criminal, then you 
will be helping your friends who are still free! 

Krasin’s KGB cellmate claimed to have been converted 
from his previous political skepticism to Krasin’s 
dissident opinions, and gradually persuaded him that by 
standing up for those views during his interrogation he 
would be continuing his fight for Russian democracy. 
According to the absurdly stilted language of the 



interrogation report, “The agent also introduced the 
beauty of nature and the significance of art and literature 
into their conversations. This rekindled Krasin’s love of 
life and made him forget his bitter disenchantment.” 
Rumors fed to him that Yakir was now talking to his 
interrogator seem finally to have persuaded Krasin to take 
his cellmate’s advice. “The idea that Yakir was giving 
full, true and detailed evidence,” declared his interrogator 
Aleksandrovsky dramatically, “hung over him like the 
sword of Damocles. 

Krasin’s early replies to Aleksandrovsky’s questions 
were extremely cautious. Initially he limited himself to 
refuting alleged evidence that he had attempted to subvert 
or weaken Soviet power, refusing to answer anything he 
considered a leading question. He prepared written 
answers to those questions he accepted, sometimes 
preparing and correcting several drafts before handing one 
of them to his interrogator. This laborious procedure 
continued for two months, during which Krasin provided 
what the KGB considered “only worthless information.” 
Like all good interrogators, however, Aleksandrovsky 
was patient. “The importance of these first 
interrogations,” he believed, “was that they enabled 
psychological contact to be established.” 

The first sign of a breakthrough came on September 27, 
1972. As usual Krasin insisted that, “The accusation 
against me is monstrous. I cannot do what is against my 
conscience. I cannot admit that I am guilty of something 



that I have not done or repent of crimes which have not 
been committed.” But, for the first time, he seemed to 
accept that his career as a dissident was at an end. “I will 
not,” he announced, “carry on with my work.” Krasin 
added that he did not believe Aleksandrovsky’s main aim 
was to sentence him to another term in a labor camp. 
Henceforth the scope of the interrogation was broadened. 
Each day Aleksandrovsky allowed Krasin to choose the 
subject for discussion but tried, when the opportunity 
arose, to develop their conversation in ways which 
showed the hopelessness of his position and of the 
dissident cause. While discussing the fight against 
counter-revolution in the Dzerzhinsky era, 
Aleksandrovsky mentioned the case of the arch anti- 
Bolshevik Boris Savinkov, who had been lured back to 
Russia in August 1924. Krasin’s KGB cellmate was 
primed to raise the question of how long Savinkov’ s 
interrogation had lasted. The answer, which Krasin 
doubtless discovered from a book lent him by his 
interrogator, was that after only nine days Savinkov 
publicly renounced his “bloody struggle” against the 
Bolshevik regime and declared that he unconditionally 
recognized the Soviet state. When Krasin asked him 
why Savinkov had recanted, Aleksandrovsky replied that 
he had seen the hopelessness of his situation, realized that 
his struggle against Soviet power was doomed to failure 
and understood that his actions were against the interests 
of the Russian people. 



Whenever Krasin expressed interest in a subject during 
interrogation, Aleksandrovsky would try to find him 
relevant books and articles which would have a “positive 
influence” on him. He was thought to be particularly 
impressed by the stirring account by the British journalist 
Alexander Werth in his book Russia at War of the 
endurance and triumph of the Soviet people during the 
Great Patriotic War. On one occasion Krasin was even 
given copies of the banned periodical Posev, published by 
the emigre NTS (social democrat organization), which 
contained articles by himself and Yakir. Krasin was seen 
to rub his hands with anticipation as he opened the pages 
of the periodical. After a time, he put the copies of Posev 
down in disgust, declaring that it was “White Guard 
drivel” and that he had never read “anything so primitive 
and bereft of ideas.” From his reading of the file, 
Mitrokhin suspected that Krasin had been given 
fabricated copies of the periodical specially designed to 
arouse his indignation. 

Krasin’s separation from his wife, Yemelkina, who was 
banished into internal exile at Yesineysk, was also used to 
increase the emotional pressure on him. Alexandrovsky 
noted cynically, “Krasin loved his wife greatly and was 
ready to do anything for her sake.” On visiting Yemelkina 
at Yesineysk, he found that she too was desperate to be 
reunited with her husband. Probably as a condition of 
being allowed to visit Krasin, Yemelkina agreed to reveal 
where she had hidden “anti-Soviet literature.” After an 



emotional reunion with his wife in January 1973, Krasin 
gave Aleksandrovsky the locations of four hiding places 
containing sixty allegedly subversive foreign publications 
and 140 microfilms (totaling 5,000 frames) of other “anti- 
Soviet texts. Further pressure on Krasin was exerted 
during visits from his mother and other relatives and 
friends, all of whom had been expertly intimidated by the 
KGB.^^ 

Even after Krasin had agreed to plead guilty to the 
charges against him, however, he refused for almost two 
months to incriminate his friends. Step by step 
Aleksandrovsky overcame his resistance. First, Krasin 
agreed to talk about dissidents who had already 
confessed, then about foreign correspondents who had left 
Moscow and Soviet emigres in the USA and Israel who 
were, as he put it, “beyond the reach of the KGB.” Next 
he identified people who, he said, had not committed any 
criminal offense but had merely read “anti-Soviet 
literature” and had been present when foreign 
correspondents were given the Chronicle of Current 
Events. Then, almost overnight, what remained of 
Krasin’s resistance to informing on his fellow dissidents 
collapsed. He spent ten days writing by hand a document 
of over a hundred pages setting out the evidence against 
dissidents, identifying sixty of them and giving details of 
numerous incidents previously unknown to the Fifth 
Directorate — among them the origins of the Chronicle oj 
Current Events. To a triumphant Aleksandrovsky it 



seemed as though Krasin was “unburdening himself of a 
great weight.” 

At Aleksandrovsky’s prompting, Krasin then spent two 
months composing an appeal to his fellow dissidents 
which was read aloud at a meeting in Yakir’s flat in April 
1973 and, according to a KGB report, “made a strong 
impact.” “We started by demanding that the laws should 
be observed,” declared Krasin, “but ended up breaking 
them. We forgot the basic truth that we are citizens of the 
USSR and are bound to respect and keep the laws of our 
state.” Fifty-seven dissidents named by Krasin and Yakir 
were summoned for interrogation by the Moscow KGB. 
Some were subjected to emotional confrontations with 
Krasin and Yakir, who appealed to them to end the 
dissident campaign. According to KGB records, forty-two 
capitulated. Another eight “vacillated in evaluating their 
activities” but “gave assurances that they would not 
commit any anti-social acts in future.” Only seven 
remained completely unrepentant; all were given official 
cautions and put under “operational surveillance.” During 
1973 a total of 154 people associated with the dissident 
movement were cautioned by the Moscow KGB, eighty 
of them “for possessing, writing and distributing 
ideologically harmful material and for anti- social and 
politically harmful conduct.” 

The trial of Yakir and Krasin opened in Moscow on 
August 27, 1973. Solzhenitsyn dismissed it in advance as 
“a dismal repetition of the clumsy Stalin-Vyshinsky 



farces:” 


In the 1930s ... these farces, despite the primitive 
stagecraft, the smeared grease-paint, the loudness of 
the prompter, were still a great success with 
“thinking people” among Western intellectuals ... 

But if no [foreign] correspondents are to be admitted 
to the trial, it means that it has been pitched two 
grades lower still. 

Western correspondents were, however, invited to a KGB 
press conference at which Yakir and Krasin paraded their 
guilt and remorse in front of television cameras. The 
transformation of Krasin seemed so remarkable that some 
dissidents wrongly suspected he had been a KGB agent 
all along.^^ 

In the Centre, the show trial was regarded as a triumph. 
Basking in the approval of their superiors, the case 
officers of Yakir and Krasin wrote a self-congratulatory 
article in the classified in-house quarterly, KGB Sbornik, 
explaining how “the detailed tactics worked out for the 
interrogation of the accused” and the “deeply thought-out 
cultivation within the [prison] cell” by well-trained 
stoolpigeons had combined to “determine the positive 
results which were obtained at the hearing of the case.”^^ 

SAKHAROV AND SOLZHENITSYN, however, still 
remained beyond the punitive arm of the KGB. While the 



trial of Yakir and Krasin was in progress they raised the 
stakes in their campaign by publicly criticizing the 
concessions made by the United States to the Soviet 
Union in the name of East- West detente. On September 
17 Sakharov addressed a public appeal to the US 
Congress, asking it to support the Jackson- Vanik 
amendment opposing most-favored nation status for the 
USSR until it ended restrictions on emigration: 

The amendment does not represent interference in 
the internal affairs of socialist countries, but simply a 
defense of international law, without which there can 
be no mutual trust.^^ 

Sakharov’s letter, printed in capital letters in the 
Washington Post, was credited with persuading Congress 
to pass the amendment, despite the opposition of the 
Nixon administration. 

The Politburo reacted with predictable fury. Brezhnev 
absurdly denounced Sakharov’s letter as “not just an anti- 
state and anti-Soviet deed, but a Trotskyist deed.” They 
had, he declared, tolerated the behavior of Solzhenitsyn 
and Sakharov for far too long: “We should have stopped 
them right away.” Andropov, now a full (voting) member 
of the Politburo, sought to maintain the collective outrage 
of his colleagues by a series of slanted intelligence 
reports. Solzhenitsyn and Sakharov, he declared, had 
“stepped up the peddling of their services to reactionary 



imperialist, and particularly Zionist, circles,” and were 
being manipulated by, or actually colluding with. Western 
intelligence agencies. On February 7, 1974 Andropov 
submitted to the Politburo a further draft decree to deprive 
Solzhenitsyn of his citizenship and expel him from the 
Soviet Union. Simultaneously, he sent an alarmist 
personal letter to Brezhnev, implying that there would be 
serious discontent among senior Party and Military 
figures unless the decree was approved: 

... I think it impossible, despite our desire not to 
harm international relations, to delay the solution of 
the Solzhenitsyn problem any longer, because it 
could have extremely unpleasant consequences for 
us inside the country. 

This time the KGB pressure on Brezhnev and his 
colleagues was successful. On February 11 the Politburo 
formally approved “the proposals of Comrade 
Andropov.”^^ Three days later, Solzhenitsyn was forcibly 
put on board an Aeroflot flight to Frankfurt by KGB 
officers. As the plane took off, he crossed himself and 
bowed to the homeland he might never see again.^^ 

From Frankfurt Solzhenitsyn moved on to Zurich, 
where he rented a house in the city center. Paradoxically it 
was easier for the KGB to penetrate his entourage in 
Switzerland than in Russia. Abroad, among strangers, 
Solzhenitsyn found it far more difficult than at home to 



distinguish friend from foe. The KGB was quick to take 
advantage of his sympathy for the survivors of the Prague 
Spring by using StB agents in the Czech emigre 
community to win his confidence. The first to do so was 
the Russian-bom StB officer Valentina Holubova.^^ 
Though the files noted by Mitrokhin do not record her 
first meeting with Solzhenitsyn, she seems to have arrived 
on his doorstep on his first day in Zurich, claiming to be 
from Ryazan (where he had been a schoolteacher) and 
bearing a bouquet of roses and lilac. She gave him a note 
containing an old Ryazan proverb and said the lilac was to 
remind him of the lilac that bloomed in Ryazan each 
spring.^^ Within a few weeks, at most, Holubova and her 
husband. Dr. Frantisek Holub (also an StB agent), had 
succeeded in ensconcing themselves as Solzhenitsyn’s 
unofficial advisers in Zurich, with Valentina also acting as 
his part-time secretary and spokeswoman.^^ 

In March 1974 the Holubs took Solzhenitsyn to see an 
exhibition of paintings by the artist Lucia Radova at a 
gallery in the village of Pfuffikon, not far from Zurich, 
owned by the Czech emigre Oskar Krause. When Krause 
told him that he too had been a political prisoner, 
imprisoned in Czech jails, Solzhenitsyn embraced him 
and burst into tears. The Holubs then introduced him to 
the young Czech writer Tomas Rezac (codenamed 
REPO), like themselves an StB officer who had 
penetrated the emigre community posing as a dissident. 



Solzhenitsyn later agreed that Dr. Holub should edit the 
work of the seven translators producing a Czech edition 
of The Gulag Archipelago, while Rezac would translate 
the long narrative poem, Prussian Nights, which 
Solzhenitsyn had written in prison in 1949.^^ 

Solzhenitsyn thus became the latest in a long line of 
leading Soviet emigrees, stretching back to the inter-war 
White Guard and Trotskyist leaders, who unwittingly 
included Soviet agents among their most trusted 
advisers. The thought of Holub and Rezac translating 
the works of the great heretic was bound to give the 
Centre some pause for thought. But 

It was deemed to be operationally justified for REPO 
to translate all Solzhenitsyn’s materials, without 
declining to translate various anti-Soviet texts or 
attempting to tone them down, since he might 
otherwise lose Solzhenitsyn’s confidence and the 
texts would in any case be translated by someone 
else. 

Because of the importance of the PAUK (Solzhenitsyn) 
case, REPO’s instructions were personally drawn up, 
doubtless in consultation with the KGB, by the head of 
StB foreign intelligence, Hladik, and his deputy, Dovin.^^ 
Intelligence from the Holubs and Rezac allowed the 
KGB to monitor Solzhenitsyn’s contacts with supporters 
inside the Soviet Union as well as his activities in the 



West. Andropov reported to the Politburo on May 2: 


[Solzhenitsyn] is hatching plans to conduct 
subversive activity against the USSR. Residing in 
Zurich, he has established, in particular, contacts 
with representatives of the Czechoslovak emigres in 
Switzerland, with the assistance of whom he intends 
to arrange the illegal delivery of his writings and 
other material of an anti-Soviet nature to the Soviet 
Union. Solzhenitsyn stated in a discussion with the 
Czechoslovak emigres that his future activities 
would be subordinate primarily to the interests of the 
“opposition inside the USSR.” 

Following usual practice, Andropov did not identify his 
sources by name; in particular he did not reveal to the 
Politburo that the main emigres with whom Solzhenitsyn 
had had these conversations were StB agents. On July 24 
he reported that Solzhenitsyn had set up a “Russian Social 
Fund,” using royalties from his books, to “assist the 
families of political prisoners detained in Soviet camps.” 
As on other occasions, Andropov also gave a woefully 
distorted assessment of Solzhenitsyn’s influence in exile. 
“Available information,” he informed the Politburo, “... 
indicates that after Solzhenitsyn’s deportation abroad, 
interest in him in the West is steadily on the decline.” At 
that very moment, volume I of The Gulag Archipelago 
was a runaway bestseller, with a print run of 2 million 



paperbacks in the USA alone. KGB assessments on 
Solzhenitsyn, as on some other subjects, were distorted at 
two levels. First, residencies in varying degrees told the 
Centre what it wanted to hear. Secondly, Andropov told 
the Politburo what he wanted it to hear — which in the 
summer of 1974 emphasized the correctness of the 
decision to send Solzhenitsyn into exile but did not 
include the phenomenal Western sales figures of his 
books. 

On September 19, 1974 Andropov approved a large- 
scale, “multifaceted plan” (no. 5/9-16091) to discredit and 
destabilize Solzhenitsyn and his family and cut his links 
with dissidents in the Soviet Union. A Fifth Department 
officer with experience of the PAUK case was sent to 
Switzerland on long-term assignment to direct a series of 
operations against Solzhenitsyn.^^ The KGB sponsored a 
series of hostile books and articles, among them a memoir 
published under the name of his first wife, Natalia 
Reshetovskaya, but probably mainly composed by 
Service A. In 1975 Rezac suddenly disappeared from 
Zurich, taking the manuscript of Prussian Nights with 
him, and made his way to Moscow to begin work on a 
biography intended to destroy Solzhenitsyn’s reputation. 
Shortly afterwards, Solzhenitsyn realized that he had also 
been betrayed by the Holubs, on whom he had relied ever 
since he had arrived in Zurich, and broke all contact with 
them.^^ Andropov gave orders to maintain “an 



atmosphere of distrust and suspicion between PAUK and 
the people around him” by feeding Solzhenitsyn constant 
rumors that others in his circle were KGB agents or 
deceiving him in a variety of ways. 

The plan to destabilize Solzhenitsyn also sought “to 
create a state of nervousness within his family” through a 
constant stream of threats against his children and the 
sending of suspicious packages which looked as if they 
might contain explosives. The Sakharovs were 
subjected to similar treatment. Shortly before Elena 
Bonner was due to have eye surgery, they were sent 
photographs of eyes gouged out of their sockets and other 
horrifying eye injuries. At Christmas 1974 they received 
dozens of envelopes containing photographs of car 
accidents, brain surgery and monkeys with electrodes 
implanted in their brains. All such threats, Solzhenitsyn 
told Time magazine, “come from one and the same 
organization” — the KGB.^^ 

What is most striking about the KGB’s campaign 
against Solzhenitsyn during his Swiss exile is the 
enormous priority and resources devoted to it. The “plan 
of agent operational measures” to be implemented during 
1975 against Solzhenitsyn and the emigree journal, 
Kontinent, with which he was associated, was jointly 
agreed late in the previous year by Kryuchkov, 
Grigorenko and Bobkov (heads of the First Chief, Second 
Chief and Fifth Directorates). It had nineteen sections, of 



which the first three alone provided for twenty different 
hostile operations. The residencies in Berne, Geneva, 
Karlshorst, London, Paris, Rome and Stockholm were all 
involved in implementing the “agent operational 
measures” and a series of joint operations were planned 
with other Soviet Bloc intelligence agencies. In July 
1976 plans for yet more active measures, jointly proposed 
once again by Kryuchkov, Grigorenko and Bobkov, were 
approved by Andropov. 

The destabilization campaign had some success. Swiss 
newspapers reported that Solzhenitsyn asked for, but did 
not receive, police protection. KGB harassment in Zurich 
was probably at least partly responsible for his decision to 
move to the United States in 1976.^^ Since his expulsion 
from Russia two years earlier, Solzhenitsyn had lost some 
of the immense moral authority he had formerly 
possessed as a persecuted dissident. Dismayed by what he 
saw as Western indifference to the Soviet menace, he took 
to denouncing, sometimes in apocalyptic tones, the moral 
failings of a West he did not fully understand. After 
settling in Vermont, he became a virtual recluse on his 
fifty-acre estate behind an eight-foot-high chainlink fence 
topped with barbed wire, as he devoted himself to writing 
a series of historical novels on Russia in the years leading 
up to the October Revolution. 

Solzhenitsyn’s life as a recluse (with occasional 
excursions to deliver the 1978 Harvard Commencement 



Address and other solemn pronouncements on East and 
West) may well have spared him further KGB penetration 
of his entourage of the kind that had taken place in 
Zurich. Previously, on August 23, 1975, Andropov had 
approved a draft directive (no. 150/S-9195), jointly 
proposed by the heads of the First Chief and Fifth 
Directorates, Kryuchkov and Bobkov, establishing as the 
main priority in operations against emigres the infiltration 
of at least one illegal into Solzhenitsyn’s inner circle. 
When Solzhenitsyn moved to the United States, F. G. 
Bolbotenko, a Fine KR officer in the New York 
residency, was put in charge of operations against him. 
Though there were numerous active measures designed to 
discredit Solzhenitsyn and embroil him with other 
emigres, there is no evidence that any illegal succeeded in 
gaining his confidence. 

Despite failing to penetrate Solzhenitsyn’s Vermont 
fastness, the KGB seems to have been broadly satisfied by 
the later 1970s that the great writer’s reputation in the 
West had declined dramatically. In the summer of 1978, 
the FCD and Fifth Directorate jointly arranged the 
screening of a video of Solzhenitsyn’s Harvard Address to 
a meeting of leading KGB and Party figures. It was an 
extraordinary moment in Soviet history. Never before, 
almost certainly, had such an audience gathered together 
to hear a lecture by a leading opponent of the Soviet 
system. The Moscow notables watched, probably 
intently, as Solzhenitsyn gave his Commencement 



audience in Harvard Yard, while drizzle moistened their 
academic gowns, an uncompromising “measure of bitter 
truth.” He denounced those in the West whose silence and 
inertia had made them “accomplices” in the suffering 
imposed on those who lived under Communist rule. 
Corrupted by materialism and selfish individualism, the 
West had become morally impoverished: “Two hundred 
or even fifty years ago, it would have seemed quite 
impossible, in America, that an individual be granted 
boundless freedom with no purpose, simply for the 
satisfaction of his whims ...” Though many in Harvard 
Yard were skeptical, and some were probably seething, 
they dutifully followed tradition and cheered 
Solzhenitsyn’s address. 

The KGB screening of the address was followed by 
commentaries from FCD and Fifth Directorate officers. 
Though Mitrokhin’s brief notes report only their 
conclusions, they probably cited the hostile reception 
accorded to Solzhenitsyn’s “bitter truth” by The New York 
Times and the Washington Post. The Times leader writer 
found “Mr. Solzhenitsyn’s world view ... far more 
dangerous than the easy-going spirit which he finds so 
exasperating,” while the Post denounced his “gross 
misunderstanding of western society.” The KGB 
commentators were agreed that Solzhenitsyn had 
alienated his American listeners by his “reactionary views 
and intransigent criticism of the US way of life — a fact 
which could not fail to have a negative effect on his 



authority in the eyes of the West and his continued use in 
anti-Soviet propaganda.” The meeting of KGB and Party 
notables agreed that no active measures were required to 
counter the Harvard Address. Solzhenitsyn, they 
evidently believed, had discredited himself 



TWENTY 


IDEOLOGICAL SUBVERSION 


Part 2: The Victory of the Dissidents 


On August 1, 1975 the Soviet leadership committed what 
turned out to be a strategic blunder in its war against the 
dissidents. As part of the Helsinki Accords on Security 
and Co-operation in Europe, the United States, Canada 
and all European states save Albania and Andorra agreed 
to protect a series of basic human rights. Though 
Andropov warned against the consequences, a majority of 
the Politburo shared Gromyko’s confident view that “We 
are masters in our house” — that the Soviet Union would 
be free to interpret the human rights provisions of the 
Helsinki Accord as it saw fit. In fact, as Zbigniew 
Brzezinski predicted, the accord “put the Soviet Union on 
the ideological defensive.”^ Henceforth its human rights 
critics both at home and abroad could justly claim that it 



was in breach of an international agreement it had freely 
entered into. 

The most influential of those critics was, increasingly, 
Andrei Sakharov. From the KGB’s viewpoint, both the 
importance and the difficulty of discrediting Sakharov 
before world opinion were heightened by his being 
awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in October 1975. The Oslo 
residency had been instructed to do all in its power to 
prevent the award, but was forced to confess that it was 
powerless to influence the Nobel Peace Prize committee 
which, it claimed, was wholly composed of 
“reactionaries” — chief amongst them its chairwoman, the 
Labor Party deputy Aase Lionaes.^ Sakharov pronounced 
the Peace Prize “a great honor not just for me but also for 
the whole human rights movement”: 

I feel I share this honor with our prisoners of 
conscience — they have sacrificed their most precious 
possession, their liberty, in defending others by open 
and non-violent means. ^ 

Just over a week after he received news of the award, the 
first of the “Sakharov Hearings,” held in response to an 
appeal launched by Sakharov and other dissidents a year 
earlier, opened in Copenhagen to hear evidence of Soviet 
human rights abuses — almost all of them in breach of the 
Helsinki Accords. 

On November 22 Andropov approved a document 



entitled “Complex Operational Measures to Expose the 
Political Background to the Award of the Nobel Peace 
Prize to Sakharov.” The sheer range and ambitiousness of 
the active measures proposed indicated Sakharov’s 
increasing prominence as a KGB target. In collaboration, 
where necessary, with other KGB directorates, the FCD 
was instructed: 

• to inspire articles and speeches by public and 
political personalities in Norway, Finland, Sweden, 
Denmark, Britain and the FRG, to develop the theme 
that the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to Sakharov 
was an attempt by certain political circles to slow 
down the process of detente . . . 

• to organize articles and speeches by 
representatives of public and political circles through 
KGB assets in Finland, France, Italy and Britain, to 
demonstrate the absurdity of attempting to link the 
award of the Peace Prize to Sakharov to a decision 
relating to the all-European [Helsinki] Conference ... 

• to organize the mailing of letters and 
declarations protesting about the award of the Peace 
Prize to Sakharov to the Nobel Committee of the 
Norwegian Storting [parliament] and to influential 
press organs in various Western countries ... 

• to pass material compromising Sakharov to 
the Danish, Swedish and Finnish press, hinting at his 
links with reactionary organizations financed by the 
CIA and other Western special services; 



• to take steps designed to persuade S. Haffner, 
the leading political observer of the West German 
Stern magazine to make negative comments on the 
award of the Nobel Peace Prize to Sakharov. Haffner 
had already made sharp criticisms in the FRG press 
when Sakharov was put forward for the Peace Prize 
in 1973; 

• to pass information to the “dissident” 
emigration in western Europe designed to exacerbate 
relations between Sakharov and Solzhenitsyn ... 

• with the help of agents of influence among 
prominent Chilean emigres (in Algeria and Mexico), 
to disseminate the text of a [bogus] telegram of 
congratulations supposedly sent by General Pinochet 
[who had led the coup against President Allende] to 
Sakharov on the occasion of the award of the Nobel 
Peace Prize; 

• to inspire pronouncements by leading Chilean 
emigres in Italy, the FRG and France, expressing the 
outrage of all Chilean patriots at the award of the 
Nobel Peace Prize to Sakharov, who in 1973 had 
welcomed the overthrow of the Allende government 
and in return for this had been awarded the title of 
“Honorary Citizen” by Pinochet; 

• to inspire public statements by public 
personalities in the Arab countries, condemning the 
Nobel Committee’s decision on Sakharov, presenting 
this as a deal between Sakharov and the Zionists, in 



return for Sakharov’s pronouncements on the 
question of Jewish emigration from the Soviet 
Union, as the Zionists had a decisive influence on the 
Nobel Committee when it awarded the Nobel Peace 
Prize for 1975. It should be noted that the “Sakharov 
Hearings” in Copenhagen were also a form of 
payment to Sakharov by the Zionists in return for his 
pro-Israel activity; 

• to make available through Novosti for 
publication abroad a series entitled “Who Defends 
Sakharov?,” dealing with [alleged pro- Sakharov] 
criminals sentenced in the Soviet Union for bribery 
(Shtem), theft (Leviyev), instigation of terrorism 
(Bukovsky, Moroz). ^ 

The main fabrications intended to discredit Sakharov 
personally — his links with Western intelligence agencies, 
his support for the Pinochet regime and his plots with the 
Zionists — ^were all further developed in active measures 
over the next few years.^ The files examined by 
Mitrokhin, however, record few immediate successes for 
the operations approved by Andropov in November 1975. 
The best the Oslo residency could do to provoke 
Norwegian opposition to Sakharov’s award was to claim 
the credit for an article submitted to Dagbladet ridiculing 
his wife Elena Bonner, who in December 1975 collected 
the award in place of Sakharov after he was denied an exit 
visa. The article [which seems not to have been 
published] claimed that Bonner, a heavy smoker, was 



constantly providing “free publicity for the tobacco 
industry” and should have received a cigarette lighter 
rather than the Nobel Prize. ^ 

In Oslo to see Bonner collect the award on behalf of 
Sakharov was the Soviet emigre Vladimir Maximov, 
editor-in-chief of the journal Kontinent, which published 
news of dissidents throughout eastern Europe in Russian, 
English, French, German and Italian editions. The first 
issue in September 1974 had opened with a ringing 
declaration by Solzhenitsyn: 

The intelligentsia of eastern Europe speaks with the 
united voice of suffering and knowledge. All honor 
to Kontinent if it is able to make his voice heard. 

Woe (which will not be long in coming) to western 
Europe if its ears fail to hear.^ 

Kontinent rapidly established Maksimov as second only 
to Solzhenitsyn in the KGB’s list of emigrees enemies. 
Among the most ingenious of the many active measures 
used to discredit him in 1976 was one which followed the 
discovery that a car used by Eduard Mihailovich Serdinov 
(codenamed TKACHEV), an operations officer in the 
New York residency, had been bugged by the FBI. It was 
decided to stage a conversation in the car between 
Serdinov and a KGB agent from the Soviet community 
which, it was hoped, would deceive the FBI: 



SERDINOV: By the way, Solzhenitsyn’s chum 
Maksimov is also becoming more and more insolent. 
He is turning into an open enemy. 

AGENT : Which Maksimov do you mean? 
SERDINOV: That Parisian one — from the 
Kontinent. 

AGENT: Oh, don’t pay any attention to him! I have 
heard here from “certain people” ... well, from 
“them” [i.e. the KGB] ... that he is their agent and 
that he even underwent special training with them 
before he left the Soviet Union. 

Other active measures were devised to reinforce the 
impression that Maksimov was a KGB agent. ^ Whether 
any of them actually succeeded in deceiving the FBI or 
any other Western intelligence agency remains in doubt. 

Doubtless to the intense irritation of the Centre, 
Kontinent was able to publicize the formation during 1976 
and 1977 of “Helsinki Watch Groups” in Moscow, 
Ukraine, Lithuania, Georgia and Armenia to monitor 
Soviet compliance with the terms of the Helsinki 
Accords. 

At a meeting of the KGB Collegium in 1976, Andropov 
branded Sakharov “Public Enemy Number One,”^ a title 
he retained for the next nine years. The active measures 
campaign against him continued to expand for several 
years, with attacks on his wife Elena (codenamed LISA 
— “Vixen” — by the KGB) forming an increasingly large 



part of it. A list of current and impending active measures 
compiled in February 1977 included thirteen “operations 
to compromise A SKET[ Sakharov]”; seven “measures to 
cut off ASKET and LISA from their close contacts 
engaged in anti- social activity and to cause dissension in 
their circle;” eight “measures to hinder the hostile activity 
of ASKET and LISA;” and four “measures to distract 
ASKET and LISA from their hostile activity.” Such was 
the pedantic precision of active measures terminology that 
“hindrance” operations were carefully distinguished from 
those whose purpose was merely to “distract.” The main 
responsibility for directing and coordinating these thirty- 
two operations fell upon V. N. Shadrin, head of the Ninth 
Department of the Fifth Directorate.^^ It was a measure of 
the courage and character of Sakharov and Bonner that 
their sanity and determination survived the KGB’s best 
efforts to destroy them. 

The thirteen compromise operations were remarkably 
diverse. As usual, they involved a number of forgeries: 
among them a bogus State Department evaluation which 
dismissed Sakharov as a worn-out political dilettante and 
a fabricated letter from Radio Liberty’s Russian staff 
denouncing his links with the Zionists. Somewhat more 
bizarrely, attempts were made to link Sakharov with the 
gay liberation movement. Letters bearing the forged 
signatures of Sakharov and a Belorussian “group of 
homosexuals” were sent to gay rights organizations in 
Britain and Scandinavia, with the aim of prompting them 



to send letters in reply. 

The Western “bourgeois press” and its Moscow 
correspondents were fed stories — apparently without 
much success — claiming that Sakharov’s family suffered 
from hereditary mental illness, which affected both his 
children and his brother, and that he himself had 
degenerated into “a tired, weak-willed man,” “unable to 
take independent decisions” because of his domineering 
wife. Instructions were given for suitably gullible foreign 
correspondents to be invited to meet the Deputy 
Procurator-General, S. I. Gusev, who would provide 
“objective information about the nature of the official 
warning given to ASKET about his provocative 
actions.”^ ^ 

The most vicious of the active measures were directed 
against Elena Bonner both because Sakharov’s worldwide 
reputation for integrity made him a less vulnerable target 
than his less well-known wife, and because attacks on 
Bonner wounded Sakharov more deeply than those on 
himself During Sakharov’s fifteen years of persecution, 
his only resort to physical violence was to slap the face of 
Nikolai Yakovlev, one of the writers used by the KGB to 
libel Bonner. The character assassination of Bonner 
began in earnest with an article entitled “Madame Bonner 
— Sakharov’s Evil Genius?” planted in the New York 
Russian-language newspaper Russkiy Golos {Russian 
Voice) by an agent codenamed YAK, in July 1976.^^ 



Simultaneously, Bonner began to receive letters prepared 
by Service A but purporting to come from one “Semyon 
Zlotnik,” who claimed to know the secrets of her “dark 
past” and demanded money with menaces. 

The “dark past” fabricated by the KGB over the next 
few years was an explosive mixture of sex and violence. 
“In her dissolute youth,” it was claimed, “[Bonner] had 
developed an almost professional knack for seducing and 
subsequently sponging off older men of considerable 
stature.” During the war she had allegedly seduced the 
poet Vsevelod Bagritsky, then hounded his wife to her 
grave by bombarding her with obscene telephone calls. 
Her next victim, according to the KGB libel, was a well- 
known engineer, “Moisei Zlotnik” (“uncle” of the 
fictitious Semyon Zlotnik), who was jailed for murdering 
his wife on instructions from Bonner. To escape justice, 
Bonner was said to have become a nurse on a wartime 
hospital train — only to be sacked when her seduction of 
the elderly doctor in charge was discovered by the 
doctor’s daughter. Among Bonner’s fictitious post-war 
conquests was her equally elderly, married French uncle, 
Leon Kleiman; the affair was said to have continued even 
after she “ensnared” Sakharov. The KGB went to 
enormous pains to fabricate this account of Bonner’s 
supposedly homicidal sexual appetites, even sending an 
illegal to France in 1977 to recover some of the papers of 
Leon Kleiman (who had died five years earlier) to assist 



in the production of Service A’s forgeries. 

Unsurprisingly, the KGB found considerable difficulty 
for several years in placing this libellous fiction in the 
Western “bourgeois press.” It eventually appeared as a 
“world exclusive” in the Sicilian newspaper Sette Giorni, 
whose staff — according to the Rome residency — included 
a “confidential contact” codenamed KIRILL. On April 
12, 1980 Sette Giorni printed a sensational story 
headlined “WHO IS ELENA BONNER? The Wife of 
Academician Sakharov Perpetrator of Several Murders.” 
An unnamed member of the editorial staff was reported to 
have met the elusive “Semyon Zlotnik” while on holiday 
in Paris, and to have learned the story from him. Sette 
Giorni cited at some length a series of Service A 
forgeries, among them a letter from “Moisei Zlotnik” to 
Bonner reproaching her for persuading him to murder his 
wife: “You acted precisely, cold-bloodedly and rationally 
... And your demand ‘to bump her off seemed as natural 
as remembering that I should give you your favorite 
chocolates on your birthday.” The article also cited an 
equally fraudulent diary supposedly written by Leon 
Kleiman describing his seduction by Bonner and 
denouncing her obsession with “subjugating others” to 
her will.^^ The Rome residency proudly sent fifty copies 
of the Sette Giorni article to the Centre, together with 
subsequent readers’ letters denouncing Bonner, most of 
which had been written or prompted by the residency 



itself. When reporting on the operation to the Central 
Committee, the KGB is unlikely to have mentioned that 
Sette Giorni was a little-known provincial newspaper with 
a print run of only 20,000.^^ 

To increase the pressure on Bonner, and through her on 
Sakharov, attempts were made to deprive her of the 
support of family and friends. The first of the active 
measures devised by the KGB early in 1977 “to cut off 
ASKET and LISA from their close contacts engaged in 
anti-social activity and to cause dissension in their circle” 
listed seven different methods of harassing her daughter 
from her first marriage, Tanya, and son-in-law, Efrem 
Yankelevich, in order to force them to emigrate. The 
harassment succeeded. On September 5, 1977 Bonner 
said goodbye to Tanya and Efrem at Sheremetyevo 
airport. 

The Centre showed equal ingenuity in attempting to 
alienate the Sakharovs’ friends. Agents in the dissident 
movement were instructed to “cause dissension between 
ASKET and LISA on the one hand and their contacts 
involved in anti-social activity” by circulating disparaging 
comments about other dissidents supposedly made by 
Sakharov and Bonner.^ ^ 

The two sets of KGB active measures designed to 
“hinder the hostile activity of ASKET and LISA” also had 
the unstated aim of making daily life impossible for both 
of them. The “hindrance” operations were designed to 



“create abnormal [living] conditions” in as many ways as 
possible. Though the KGB did not yet dare to withdraw 
Sakharov’s driving license, no other member of his or 
Bonner’s families was allowed to obtain — or retain — a 
license. An agent codenamed MORVIKOV was 
instructed to stir up trouble between the couple and 
Andrei Sakharov’s children. The “distraction” operations 
included flooding the Sakharovs with bogus requests for 
help from people who had fallen foul of the Soviet legal 
system or who simply sought their advice on non-existent 
problems. The cumulative effect of the KGB’s active 
measures took an inevitable toll — particularly on the 
health of Bonner, who was suffering from a heart 
condition. There were times, she wrote later, “when it was 
difficult for me to walk even a hundred yards, when even 
sitting at the typewriter made me break out in a cold 
sweat.” Simply thinking about the allegations about her 
private life made her feel sick — or even that she was 
about to have a heart attack.^^ 

THE EXTENT OF the Sakharovs’ covert persecution was 
due partly to the fact that the KGB did not yet dare 
imprison them. The president of the Soviet Academy of 
Sciences solemnly assured his American opposite number 
that “not one hair of Dr. Sakharov’s head” would be 
harmed — though, as Bonner wryly remarked, the promise 
meant little since Sakharov was almost bald.^^ During 



1977, however, there was a wave of arrests of other well- 
known dissidents, among them the two most prominent 
members of the “Helsinki Watch Groups”: the veteran 
civil rights campaigner Aleksandr Ginzburg, victim of the 
botched 1968 show trial, and the physicist Yuri Orlov, 
founder of the Moscow group. Andropov’s 
characteristically slanted intelligence reports to the 
Politburo sought to implicate both in the ideological 
subversion campaigns allegedly run by Western 
intelligence agencies: 

The enemy’s special services and ideological centers 
are applying serious efforts to invigorate and extend 
the hostile activity of anti-Soviet elements on the 
territory of the Soviet Union. Especially notable is 
the effort of Western special services to organize an 
association of persons opposing the existing state 
and social order in our country ... The need has thus 
emerged to terminate the actions of Orlov, Ginzburg 
and others once and for all, on the basis of existing 
law 

Orlov and Ginzburg were arrested in February 1977. A 
month later it was the turn of the leading Jewish human 
rights activist and “refusenik” Anatoli Shcharansky. For 
the next year all three withstood the best efforts of teams 
of KGB interrogators to cajole and bully them into 
cooperating in their own show trials. On December 29, 



1977 Orlov’s chief investigator, Captain Yakovlev, made 
what amounted to a formal admission of failure. After 
Yakovlev showed him the official charge sheet, Orlov 
took notes of it but “refused to sign it, saying that he 
wholly rejected the charge.” The record of the 
interrogation on that day (reproduced as an appendix to 
this chapter) shows Orlov, ten months after his arrest, 
obviously getting the better of his interrogator. When 
asked whether he understood the charge against him, 
Orlov replied that it was not clear to him, and that he had 
been shown no “evidence that my actions had the 
intention of undermining or weakening the Soviet 
regime.” He put in writing a complaint that “[i]t has never 
been explained to me precisely and unambiguously what 
is meant by the words ‘undermining,’ ‘weakening,’ and 
even ‘Soviet regime.’ ” Interrogator Yakovlev offered no 
explanation. Orlov went on to complain against the 
manner of Yakovlev’s interrogation: “You first make an 
assertion of your own, and then ask whether this is a fact. 
This is the typical way of putting a leading question.” 
Orlov claimed that the documents he had circulated on 
behalf of the Helsinki Watch Group had had a beneficial 
effect. They had been studied by “progressive forces in 
the West,” such as the French and Italian Communist 
parties, “whose criticism has clearly improved certain 
aspects of human rights in the USSR.” Fewer people were 
being sent to prison camps or being mistreated in 
psychiatric hospitals, and fewer children from 



unregistered Christian sects were being taken away from 
their parents. Yakovlev, as usual, had no answer. Orlov 
made a written protest that his previous request for 
Yakovlev to be taken off his case had been turned 
down.^^ 

The most striking feature of Orlov’s trial in May 1978, 
apart from his own courageous defiance, was the pathetic 
spectacle of fifteen prosecution witnesses insisting that 
Soviet citizens enjoyed all the freedoms guaranteed by the 
Helsinki Accords. For campaigning for those very 
freedoms, Orlov was sentenced to seven years’ 
imprisonment, followed by five in exile. 

Ginzburg, who was tried two months later, knew that, 
as a re-offender, he was liable to a ten-year sentence. But, 
to his surprise: 

They played a little game with me. The prosecution 
told the court that he was only asking for eight years, 
because I had helped the police in the Shcharansky 
case. It was a lie, but it was a good piece of character 
assassination for them to use in their propaganda and 
to make life hard for me in the camps. 

Shcharansky ’s trial, held at the same time as 
Ginzburg’s, had moments of farce as well as brutality. At 
one point a witness named Platonov was asked, “What 
can you tell us about the case of Shcharansky?” 
“Nothing,” he replied. “I’m not familiar with the case.” 



But Ginzburg, he declared, had behaved very badly. It 
quickly became clear that Platonov had turned up in the 
wrong court. The trial ended, however, in a great moral 
victory for Shcharansky. He declared in his closing 
address: 

I am proud that I came to know and work with such 
people as Andrei Sakharov, Yuri Orlov and 
Aleksandr Ginzburg, who are carrying on the best 
traditions of the Russian intelligentsia. But most of 
all, I feel part of a marvelous historical process — the 
process of the national revival of Soviet Jewry and 
its return to the homeland, to Israel. 

For two thousand years the Jewish people, my 
people, have been dispersed all over the world and 
seemingly deprived of any hope of returning. But 
still, each year Jews have stubbornly, and apparently 
without reason, said to each other, “Next year in 
Jerusalem!” And today, when I am further than ever 
from my dream, from my people and from my Avital 
[ Shcharansky ’s wife], and when many difficult years 
of prisons and camps lie ahead of me, I say to my 
wife and to my people, “Next year in Jerusalem!” 

And to the court, which has only to read a 
sentence that was prepared long ago — to you I have 
nothing to say.^^ 


The KGB’s main fear in the aftermath of the show 



trials of Orlov, Ginzburg and Shcharansky was that Orlov, 
like Sakharov three years earlier, would be awarded the 
Nobel Peace Prize. The KGB residency in Norway was 
ordered to give the highest priority to an active measures 
campaign, personally overseen by Andropov himself, 
designed to discredit Orlov and ensure that his candidacy 
failed.^^ On October 27, 1978 the Oslo resident, Leonid 
Alekseyevich Makarov (codenamed SEDOV), rang 
Suslov, the Politburo’s leading ideologist, in the middle of 
the night to pass on the good news that the prize had gone 
instead to the Egyptian and Israeli leaders Anwar Sadat 
and Menachem Begin. Makarov succeeded in claiming 
more of the credit than he deserved for what was regarded 
by the KGB as a famous victory. In a notably immodest 
telegram to the Centre, he reported that the residency had 
successfully “carried out complex active measures 
through reliable assets in order to disrupt the anti-Soviet 
operation” to award the prize to Orlov. It claimed to have 
brought pressure to bear during conversations with a 
series of Norwegian political leaders, chief among them 
Knut Frydenlund, the foreign minister, Reiulf Steen, 
chairman of the Norwegian Labor Party and of the 
Parliamentary Foreign Policy Committee, Tor Halvorsen, 
chairman of the Central Federation of Trade Unions and 
of the Board of the Norway — USSR Friendship Society, 
and Trygve Bratteli, a former prime minister and 
chairman of the Parliamentary Labor Party Group: 



In the course of these conversations, the provocative 
nature and anti-Soviet bias of the agitation around 
Yuri Orlov was emphasized ... It was pointed out that 
the political leadership of Norway needed to show 
proper responsibility for the state and development 
of bilateral relations between our countries. The 
conversations produced the desired response in 
influential circles of the Norwegian Labor Party. The 
work that we did exerted useful influence on the 
foreign policy leadership of Norway and, in our 
opinion, made it possible for the residency’s task to 
be carried out — to prevent the award of the Nobel 
Peace Prize to Yuri Orlov and his Committee. 

The Centre gave Makarov as much credit as he gave 
himself. Viktor Fedorovich Grushko, head of the FCD 
Third Department (whose responsibilities included 
Scandinavia), telegraphed congratulations on “the 
determination and operational effectiveness which the 
residency has shown while carrying out this work.”^^ 

ANDROPOV REMAINED AS obsessed with ideological 
subversion during his final years as KGB chairman as he 
had been at the outset. The war against subversion 
extended even to abstract painting. A joint report in 1979 
by the KGB Moscow Directorate and the Moscow 
department of the Fifth Directorate proudly reported that, 
over the past two years, “it proved possible to use agents 



to prevent seven attempts by avant-garde artists to make 
provocative arrangements to show their pictures.” Four 
“leaders of the avant-garde artists” had been recruited as 
agents. Surveillance of the “creative intelligentsia” was an 
important part of “the task of the [KGB] agencies to 
protect the intelligentsia from the influence of bourgeois 
ideology”: 

Creative workers produce individualistic works; they 
are cut off from the positive influence of the 
collective for forming and training their personality; 
they develop an egocentric attitude towards reality, 
one that is based on strictly personal perceptions, 
personal interest, arrogance, ambition and over- 
estimation of their importance. 

Andropov told a Fifth Directorate conference in March 
1979 that the KGB could not afford to ignore the 
activities of a single dissident, however obscure: 

Our enemies — and even certain comrades from 
Communist Parties in Western countries — often 
bring up this question: “If, as you say, you have 
constructed a developed socialist society, then do 
various anti- social phenomena or the negative 
activities of an insignificant handful of people really 
represent a threat to it? Are they really capable of 
shaking the foundations of socialism?” 



Of course not, we reply, if one takes each act or 
politically harmful trick individually. But if one 
takes them all together, combining their content with 
their purpose as regards ideological sabotage, then 
every such act represents a danger. And we cannot 
ignore it. We simply do not have the right to permit 
even the smallest miscalculation here, for in the 
political sphere any kind of ideological sabotage is 
directly or indirectly intended to create an opposition 
which is hostile to our system — to create an 
underground, to encourage a transition to terrorism 
and other extreme forms of struggle, and, in the final 
analysis, to create the conditions for the overthrow of 
socialism. 

The experience of Hungary in 1956 and 
Czechoslovakia in 1968 showed that behind the Soviet 
dissidents were “the main organizers of ideological 
sabotage — the intelligence services and subversive centers 
of the imperialist nations. The struggle against them must 
be decisive, uncompromising, and merciless.” Within the 
Soviet Union the “twelve-year ideological struggle” of the 
Fifth Directorate showed that repression worked: 

The Check lists have learned to quash undesirable 
and hostile phenomena in their initial stages. This is 
confirmed by the facts. Of the 15,580 people who 
were suppressed last year, only 107 showed 



themselves to be hostile a second time.^^ 

In 1980 even Sakharov ceased to be untouchable. 
While being driven to the Academy of Sciences on 
January 22 he was arrested, taken to the prosecutor’s 
office and told that he and his wife were to be exiled to 
Gorky, a city closed to Westerners: “You are forbidden to 
go beyond the city limits of Gorky. You’ll be kept under 
surveillance, and you are forbidden to meet with or 
contact foreigners or criminal elements [dissidents]. The 
KGB Fifth Directorate organized a series of workplace 
meetings in Gorky as well as broadcasts on local radio 
and television in an attempt to ensure that Sakharov and 
Bonner were reduced to pariah status throughout their 
exile. To the KGB’s embarrassment, however, Sakharov’s 
banishment to Gorky was quickly followed by an 
unconnected period of social unrest which it feared would 
become known in the West. In May there was a strike at 
the car factory there. In September and October, after a 
series of four murders in Gorky, rumors spread rapidly 
round the city that murders were in fact occurring daily 
but were being officially concealed. In the ensuing panic 
schools suspended some of their classes and factories 
canceled night shifts. There were numerous letters to the 
authorities pleading for the murderers to be caught. To the 
Centre’s relief, however, the mayhem in Gorky passed 
unnoticed in the West.^^ 

During the early 1980s the dissident movement seemed 



at its lowest ebb since its emergence in the 1960s. Most 
leading dissidents were in labor camps or exile. Those 
who remained at liberty were under constant KGB 
surveillance. Samizdat literature was reduced to a trickle. 
During the second half of the 1980s, however, the 
dissidents found themselves, to their great surprise, 
rapidly transformed from “anti-social elements” into the 
prophets of perestroika. The chief agent of this 
transformation was Mikhail Gorbachev. 

“When I became General Secretary,” writes Gorbachev 
in his Memoirs, “I considered it an important task to 
rescue Academician Sakharov from exile. The record 
of his statements in both public and private during his first 
year as Soviet leader, however, tells a more complicated 
story. At a Politburo meeting on August 29, 1985, 
Gorbachev announced that he had received “a letter from 
a certain Mr. Sakharov, whose name will not be unknown 
to you. He asks us to allow his wife Bonner to go abroad 
for medical treatment and visit relatives.” The KGB 
chairman, Viktor Chebrikov, reported that Sakharov was 
in poor health: “He has largely lost his position as a 
political figure and recently we have heard nothing new 
from him. So perhaps Bonner ought to be allowed abroad 
for three months.” Chebrikov appeared to believe the 
propaganda image of Bonner sedulously cultivated by the 
KGB over the previous decade: “We must not forget that 
[Sakharov] acts very much under Bonner’s influence ... 
She has one hundred per cent influence over him.” 



“That’s what Zionism does for you!” joked Gorbachev. 
Chebrikov added that, with Bonner away, Sakharov might 
even be willing to reach some sort of accommodation. 
Though he did not tell the Politburo, Chebrikov was 
doubtless aware from KGB surveillance reports that 
Sakharov had welcomed Gorbachev’s election as general 
secretary with the comment: “It looks as if our country’s 
lucky. We’ve got an intelligent leader 

Aleksandr Yakovlev, the most influential reformer 
among Gorbachev’s advisers, secretly asked two officials 
of the Central Committee’s international information 
department, Andrei Grachev and Nikolai Shishlin, to 
prepare a case which would persuade the Politburo to end 
Sakharov’s exile. According to Grachev, both Yakovlev 
and Gorbachev realized that neither democratic reform 
nor the normalization of East — West relations could 
proceed so long as Sakharov’s banishment continued. But 
“the delicacy of the problem was indicated by Yakovlev’s 
conspiratorial tone” as he emphasized the need to avoid 
attracting the attention of the KGB. Grachev and Shishlin 
had to conduct an elaborate covert operation even to 
obtain copies of Sakharov’s works without Chebrikov 
realizing what they were up to. On December 1, 1986 
Gorbachev finally considered the time to be ripe to raise 
the Sakharov question at the Politburo, and gained its 
approval to end his exile. On December 15 two 
electricians, escorted by a KGB officer, arrived at 



Sakharov’s Gorky flat and installed a telephone. At 10 
a.m. the next day he received a call from Gorbachev. 
“You [and Bonner] can return to Moscow together,” 
Gorbachev told him. “You have an apartment there ... Go 
back to your patriotic work!”^^ 

Though Gorbachev probably had in mind Sakharov’s 
work at the Academy of Sciences, by far his greatest 
impact was on the transition to a democratic political 
system — in changing the Soviet Union from what the 
Marquis de Custine, a French visitor to Tsarist Russia 
over a century and a half earlier, had described as a 
“nation of mutes.” Custine had famously prophesied: 

Nations are mute only for a time — sooner or later the 
day of discussion arises ... As soon as speech is 
restored to this silenced people, one will hear so 
much dispute that an astonished world will think it 
has returned to the confusion of Babel.^^ 

“The day of discussion” arrived in Russia on May 25, 
1989, with the opening of the first session of the Congress 
of People’s Soviets, the product of the first contested 
elections since 1917. Gorbachev later acknowledged that, 
of all the deputies elected to the congress, Sakharov was 
“unquestionably the most outstanding personality.”^^ At 
the time, however, Gorbachev viewed Sakharov with a 
mixture of irritation and admiration. Sakharov wanted the 
congress to abolish the one-party state, curb the power of 



the KGB and establish a directly elected office of 
president. “If only we had listened more carefully to 
Andrei Dmitriyevich [Sakharov],” Gorbachev said later, 
“we might have learned something.” But Gorbachev was 
not ready to end the Communist Party’s monopoly of 
power. He could not decide, Sakharov complained, 
whether he was “the leader of the nomenklatura or the 
leader of perestroika^ When the popular weekly 
Argumenti i Fakti published a poll showing that Sakharov 
was by far the most popular politician in the country, 
Gorbachev was so enraged that he threatened to sack the 
editor. Tension between Sakharov and Gorbachev 
renewed at the next session of the congress in December 
1989. Gorbachev brushed aside an attempt by Sakharov to 
present him with tens of thousands of telegrams calling 
for an end to the one-party state. A few days later, 
Sakharov died suddenly of a heart attack. At his lying in 
state, Gorbachev and the Politburo stood bare-headed for 
several minutes in front of the open coffin of the man 
once described by Andropov as “Public Enemy Number 
One.”43 

Sakharov’s premature death was in all likelihood partly 
due to the strain of his and Bonner’s earlier persecution, 
and to the lack of proper medical treatment during their 
Gorky exile. “The totalitarian system probably killed 
him,” said the democratic journalist Vitali Korotich. “I’m 
only glad that before he died Sakharov dealt the system a 
mortal blow.”^^ In 1990 the text of a long letter 



(previously available only in samizdat) calling for 
democratic political change addressed by Sakharov and 
two other dissidents to the Soviet leadership twenty years 
earlier was exhumed from the CPSU archives and 
published for the first time. Since Gorbachev had become 
general secretary, almost every issue raised in the 
“subversive” appeal of 1970 had been placed on the 
political agenda and acted upon.^^ Simultaneously, 
Solzhenitsyn’s works, banned from bookshops and library 
shelves since 1974, had become bestsellers. 

The dissidents were not the main agent for change in 
Gorbachev’s Soviet Union. As at other celebrated turning 
points in modem Russian history — among them the turn 
to the West in the early eighteenth century, the end of 
feudalism in 1861, collectivization and crash 
industrialization after 1929 — change came chiefly from 
the top. The Soviet system was transformed, and 
ultimately destroyed, by Gorbachev’s courageous but 
misguided attempt to reform the unreformable. The 
dissidents, however, played a major role in changing the 
political consciousness of the Soviet elite. One KGB 
report of the mid-1970s quotes Solzhenitsyn as saying 
that the main task of the dissident movement was “a 
moral and ideological preparation of the Russian 
intelligentsia to oppose the Soviet regime. Against all 
the odds, the dissidents largely succeeded in fulfilling that 
mission. A small and persecuted minority, powerless save 
for the strength and courage of its convictions, only feebly 



supported by the West, defeated a determined campaign 
to silence them by the world’s largest and most powerful 
security and intelligence service. Nowhere in the world 
during the final third of the twentieth century did a radical 
intelligentsia make a greater contribution to the 
destruction of an anti-democratic political system.

THE INTERROGATION OF YURI 
ORLOV ON DECEMBER 29, 1977 


The Interrogation of Yuri Orlov on December 29, 1977 
According to official announcements in Moscow, Fifth 
Directorate interrogation records of the interrogation of 
dissidents have been destroyed. Mitrokhin’s copy may 
therefore be the only surviving transcript of Orlov’s 
interrogation. A copy was sent by the Fifth Directorate to 
the FCD to form part of the dossier being used to prepare 
active measures to discredit Orlov in the West and prevent 
him receiving the Nobel Peace Prize. Mitrokhin’s 
growing sympathy for the dissidents is reflected in the 
fact that he copied the whole of this and some other 
documents dealing with their persecution, rather than 
following his usual practice of copying extracts, making 
notes or writing precis. 

The interrogation was conducted by Captain Yakovlev, 
senior investigator for especially important cases with the 
investigation department of the KGB Directorate for 
Moscow and Moscow Oblast under the USSR Council of 
Ministers, assisted by Assistant Procurator Chistyakov of 



Moscow City: 

QUESTION: You have been shown the resolution 
dated December 29, 1977 summoning you as the 
accused in criminal case No. 474, charged with 
committing a crime specified in Section 1 of Article 
70 of the RSFSR Criminal Code. 

Do you understand the nature of the charge? 
ORLOV: No, it is not clear to me. I have not been 
shown evidence that my actions had the intention of 
undermining or weakening the Soviet regime, or any 
other evidence; instead of which, as I see it, the 
charge presented to me contains emotional phrases 
which obscure the nature of the case. 

QUESTION: Do you admit you are guilty of the 
charge? 

ORLOV: No, I do not. I do not see any proof of my 
guilt; I do not feel guilty, in my own conscience. 
QUESTION: Do you admit the facts of preparing, 
duplicating and disseminating the documents 
specified in the charge against you? 

ORLOV : Since these documents are qualified as 
deliberately slanderous fabrications, uttered with the 
intention of undermining or weakening the Soviet 
regime, I refuse to answer your question. 
QUESTION: The investigation has established that 
you were a direct participant in the preparation, 
duplication and dissemination of the documents cited 



in the charge, and in a number of cases you were 
their author. The contents of these documents, as the 
materials of the case show, are of a slanderous 
nature, defaming the Soviet State and social order. 
What can you say about that? 

ORLOV : In answer to that question, I should like to 
say the same thing as I have said in answer to the 
previous question, namely that I do not see any 
evidence, and do not feel guilty in my own 
conscience. 

QUESTION: It has also been established that you 
acted deliberately to undermine and weaken the 
Soviet regime. What do you have to say about that? 
ORLOV : I do not believe that this has been 
established. I rely on my own inner conviction, on 
my experience and on my thoughts. 

QUESTION: Do you believe that the imperialist 
States and their agencies, to which you addressed the 
majority of the documents which incriminate you, 
are not interested in weakening and undermining the 
Soviet regime but in strengthening it? Is that how we 
must interpret you? 

ORLOV : I protest against such a manner of putting 
questions, when you first make an assertion of your 
own, and then ask whether this is a fact. This is the 
typical way of putting a leading question. The very 
problem set out in your positive assertion derives 
from the interpretation of general aspects of detente. 



or, on the contrary, of the Cold War, the mutual 
interest of the peoples in making common progress 
and, in particular, progress in the field of human 
rights or, on the other hand, their mutual interest in 
internal troubles arising because of the lack of such 
progress. The problem also derives from the 
interpretation of what international organizations one 
may turn to, and to which ones one may not (or, 
perhaps, one must not approach any international 
organizations?). It derives from the interpretation of 
whether international obligations on human rights 
may be verified at an international level; whether 
they can be criticized by the international public; 
when such criticism is permissible, and when it 
becomes interference in internal affairs; does in 
general criticism of breaches of human rights in a 
particular society undermine its structure or improve 
it; which human rights are organically linked with 
the regime, and which are not; and the same applies 
to breaches of the rights. Besides, as is well known, 
my documents have been used in the West by those 
progressive forces whose criticism has clearly 
improved certain aspects of human rights in the 
USSR. I have in mind statements by Communists in 
France, Italy and probably others, and also criticism 
from various left-wingers, their meetings and so 
forth, and also statements by representatives of 
Workers’ Parties, Socialists and Social Democrats. 



One must bear in mind that criticism from hostile 
forces can be useful for the regime; for example, 
criticism of capitalism by the USSR has undoubtedly 
strengthened that system and prolonged its existence. 
However, I did not appeal to hostile forces, but either 
to the international pubic as a whole, or to left- 
wingers, including Communists, or to members of 
governments irrespective of regime, if it was a 
question of formal international obligations. All 
criticism, both internal and external, has led to the 
following shifts in the field of human rights in the 
USSR: as the result of the 1977 reforms, the number 
of people imprisoned in the camps is actually falling; 
a clause has been introduced in the constitution 
concerning the unacceptability of persecution for 
criticism, the very persecution which was one of the 
reasons why Soviet citizens appealed to Western 
public opinion; the number of psychiatric repressions 
has been reduced; there has been a clear reduction, 
and possibly a total stop, to instances of children 
being virtually taken away from members of certain 
religious communities following decisions by the 
judicial authorities, and so forth. For these reasons, I 
can consider that your question has no direct 
relevance to the case. 

QUESTION: How do you explain your reluctance to 
give objective testimony on the substance of the 
charge? 



ORLOV: I ask you to explain the term “objective 
testimony.” In my view, I have spoken about the 
very substance of the case. 

QUESTION: Do you have anything to add? 

ORLOV : I wish to write additional comments in my 
own hand. 

[Written comments by Orlov] 

In the first place, I want to add that I did not sign the 
charge sheet, although I read it, in part because I 
requested that the investigator who has just put the 
charge to me be taken off the case, and I do not 
accept the Procuracy’s rejection of my request. 

Secondly, I want to explain further why I do not 
understand the substance of the charge. The 
accusation is based on an interpretation of Article 70 
of the RSFSR criminal code which is not clear to me: 
it has never been explained to me precisely and 
unambiguously what is meant by the words 
“undermining,” “weakening” and even “Soviet 
regime,” how the presence or absence of “purpose” 
is to be interpreted, what is considered as 
“defamatory” and what is not, and so on. 

I have read through the record; my answers have 
been written verbatim, and I do not have any 
corrections or observations. 



[Signed] Yu. Orlov. 



TWENTY-ONE 


SIGINT IN THE COLD WAR 


One of the largest gaps in histories of Cold War 
intelligence operations and international relations in both 
East and West concerns the role of signals intelligence 
(SIGINT). The role of the ULTRA intelligence generated 
by British and American codebreakers in hastening 
victory over Germany and Japan during the Second World 
War is now well known. Research on post-war SIGINT, 
by contrast, has barely begun. With the exception of the 
VENONA decrypts of mostly wartime Soviet 
communications, British and American SIGINT records 
for the Cold War remain completely closed. Other 
declassified files, however, show that SIGINT sometimes 
had an important influence on British and American 
policy. An in-house CIA history concludes that during the 
Korean War SIGINT became “a critically important 
source of information.” During the 1956 Suez Crisis, the 
British Foreign Secretary, Selwyn Lloyd, wrote to 
congratulate the director-general of the British SIGINT 
agency, GCHQ, on the “volume” and “excellence” of the 
Middle Eastern decrypts it had produced and to say “how 



valuable” the decrypts had proved to be.^ In 1992, after 
the end of the Cold War, President George Bush 
described SIGINT as “a prime factor” in his foreign 
policy.^ 

In both Britain and the United States Cold War SIGINT 
operations were controlled by a single agency. Soviet 
SIGINT was more fragmented. The GRU had 
responsibility for intercepting and decrypting military 
communications, the KGB for diplomatic and other 
civilian traffic. An attempt early in the Cold War to 
combine the SIGINT operations of the two agencies was 
short-lived. Until the late 1960s KGB SIGINT, ciphers 
and communications were the primary responsibility of 
the Eighth Chief Directorate.^ The volume of SIGINT 
supplied to the Soviet leadership was very large. The 
KGB annual report sent to Khrushchev early in 1961 
reveals that during 1960 the Eighth Chief Directorate 
decrypted 209,000 diplomatic cables sent by 
representatives of fifty-one states. No fewer than 133,200 
of these intercepts were forwarded to the Central 
Committee (chiefly, no doubt, to its international 
department). ^ By 1967 the KGB was able to decrypt 152 
cipher systems employed by a total of 72 states.^ Though 
the text of all these decrypts remains inaccessible in the 
archives of the Eighth and Sixteenth directorates, FCD 
files and other sources contain important information on 
KGB SIGINT operations and some of the results achieved 



by them. Both FCD residencies abroad and the Second 
Chief Directorate (SCD) within the Soviet Union made 
impressive contributions to these operations. 

David Kahn, the leading Western historian of SIGINT, 
plausibly concludes that, on present evidence, bugs and 
agent penetration contributed more than cryptanalysis to 
Soviet SIGINT successes during the Cold War.^ The SCD 
had a long tradition of bugging Moscow embassies. For 
over thirty years after the establishment of Soviet — 
American diplomatic relations in 1933, the United States 
embassy was one of its most successful targets. A navy 
electrician who conducted the first electronic sweep of the 
embassy in 1944 discovered 120 hidden microphones. For 
a time, according to a member of the embassy staff, more 
“kept turning up, in the legs of any new tables and chairs 
that were delivered, in the plaster of the walls, any and 
everywhere.” ^ The embassy seems to have been lulled 
into a false sense of security by its failure to find more 
bugs during the early years of the Cold War. In reality, it 
remained highly vulnerable to increasingly sophisticated 
Soviet electronic eavesdropping until at least the mid- 
1960s. 

In 1952 the new American ambassador, George 
Kennan, ordered a thorough search of both the embassy 
and his own residence. The security experts sent from 
Washington asked him to dictate the text of an old 
diplomatic despatch in his study in order to help them 
discover any voice-activated listening device. As he 



continued his dictating, one of the experts suddenly began 
hacking away at the wall behind a wooden replica of the 
Great Seal of the United States. Finding nothing in the 
wall, he then attacked the seal itself with a mason’s 
hammer and triumphantly extracted from it a pencil- 
shaped bug which had been relaying Kennan’s every 
word (and no doubt those of previous ambassadors) to 
Soviet eavesdroppers. Next morning Kennan noted a 
“new grimness” among the Soviet guards and embassy 
staff: “So dense was the atmosphere of anger and hostility 
that one could have cut it with a knife. 

In 1953 work began on a new US embassy in 
Tchaikovsky Street. During its construction American 
security personnel stood guard each day to prevent the 
installation of listening devices, particularly on the two 
top floors which were to contain the CIA station, the 
ambassador’s office and the cipher rooms. The day-long 
security vigil, however, served little purpose since the 
guards were withdrawn at night, thus allowing KGB 
personnel ample opportunity to bug the embassy. Charles 
“Chip” Bohlen, who had succeeded Kennan as 
ambassador, later blamed the extraordinary decision to 
leave the new embassy unguarded overnight on 
“carelessness” (presumably his own) and the desire “to 
save money.”^ “Carelessness” in matters of security was 
by now an embassy tradition. 

During a heated discussion with US ambassador Foy 
Kohler in 1962, Khrushchev made clear — to the dismay 



of the KGB — that he knew the ambassador had personally 
opposed the supply of steel tubing manufactured in the 
West for the construction of natural gas pipelines in the 
Soviet Union. Though Kohler probably deduced that 
Khrushchev knew the contents of some of his cables to 
Washington, he seems not to have realized that the 
information came from the bugging of his own embassy. 
In 1964, however, acting on intelligence from the KGB 
defector Yuri Nosenko, the embassy discovered over forty 
bugs concealed in bamboo tubes built into the walls 
behind the radiators in order to shield them from metal 
detectors. Remarkably, most studies of US — Soviet 
relations take no account whatever of the almost 
continuous hemorrhage of diplomatic secrets from the 
United States Moscow embassy for more than thirty 
years. 

FROM THE 1960S onwards the KGB also had a series of 
successes in bugging American and British embassies in 
the Third World, as well as the intelligence stations for 
which they provided diplomatic cover. The planting of 
listening devices on targets outside the Soviet Union was 
the responsibility of the FCD OT (Operational Technical 
Support) Directorate (also known as the Fourteenth 
Department), whose officers in residencies had a wide 
range of duties which included providing the equipment 
for clandestine photography of classified documents, 
short-range radio communication and the construction of 



apparently innocent objects (such as hairbrushes and cans 
of shaving cream) which could be used to conceal film 
and other espionage paraphernalia. Each of the OT 
eavesdropping devices, often remote-controlled, was 
individually constructed in order to assist concealment in 
the target area, which was always carefully reconnoitered 
beforehand. The devices were fixed in place either by 
FCD operations officers or by local agents employed as 
cleaners, electricians, plumbers, furniture makers and 
telephone company technicians.^^ 

One of the FCD’s most successful eavesdropping 
operations against a British target was directed at the chief 
SIS station in the Middle East, which was located in the 
British embassy building in Beirut (codenamed OVRAG, 
“Ravine”). During the early 1960s a Eebanese maid in 
the embassy, Elizabeth Aghasapet Ghazarian, was talent- 
spotted by a bishop in the Armenian Orthodox church, 
codenamed OLAF, who had been recruited as a Soviet 
agent in 1947.^^ In 1964 Ghazarian was herself recruited 
as agent ZOLUSHKA (“Cinderella”). By January 1966 
she had successfully planted a radio microphone 
(STEREO- 1) in the office of the ambassador. Sir Derek 
Riches. On February 4 ZOLUSHKA succeeded in 
concealing another radio microphone (STEREO-2), about 
the size of a matchbox, behind the desk of the Old 
Etonian SIS head of station, Peter Lunn (codenamed 
PHOENIX), who worked under diplomatic cover as the 



embassy first secretary. 

The Centre was briefed on Lunn’s background and 
career by his former colleague Kim Philby, who had 
worked in Beirut as a journalist and SIS agent from 1956 
until his defection to Moscow in 1963, soon after SIS 
obtained proof of his treachery. Lunn was one of 
Britain’s leading skiers; he had been captain of the British 
team at the 1936 Winter Olympics and was the author of a 
series of well-known skiing manuals. He and Philby 
joined SIS at almost the same moment in 1941.^^ After 
his defection Philby informed the KGB that Lunn had 
been awarded the CMG (the highest decoration then given 
to any SIS officer save the Chief) for his success in the 
planning and operation of a 500-meter tunnel under East 
Berlin which in 1955-6 tapped Soviet and East German 
telephone lines. The Centre rather admired Lunn’s 
professionalism and calm, self-assured manner. 
According to a report on operation RUBIN in 1967: 

Peter Lunn has many agents, who collect information 
on intelligence services of socialist countries and 
their representatives in the Middle East, on the 
activities of the intelligence service of the United 
Arab Republic [the short-lived union of Egypt and 
Syria], on oil policy (via a fluctuating agent 
network), on relations between Arab countries and 
the USSR and carry out the cultivation of Egyptian 



intelligence officers. In his agent work Lunn shows 
caution, experience, puts a high priority on security 
with agent contacts. With those agents who do not 
know that Lunn works under embassy cover he used 
the assumed name Joseph and met either at a 
clandestine rendezvous or at the flat of his secretary 
... For meetings with agents who are personally 
known to Lunn, he used his flat or business premises 
in the city. Lunn is demanding, strives to give his 
agents set tasks and to ensure they are carried out 
clearly. He is very economical when paying rewards 
to his agents, he adheres strictly to the rule that, 
firstly, it is only necessary to pay for information 
when it is unobtainable without paying and, 
secondly, that payment is only for that information 
which can be used actively. 

Lunn’s only major weakness, in the Centre’s view, was 
his relaxed attitude to station security. The KGB 
eavesdroppers overheard one of his staff suggest extra 
security measures. They must have been relieved to hear 
Lunn reply that no further measures were necessary. The 
bugging of the office of the Beirut head of station, 
codenamed operation RUBIN, continued for three and a 
half years after Lunn was recalled to a post at SIS 
headquarters in November 1967.^^ 

The deputy head of the FCD, Mikhail Stepanovich 
Tsymbal, reported to Andropov in 1967 that RUBIN had 



identified over fifty British agents in the Middle East and 
Europe: “Of the greatest interest is the identification of an 
SIS agent group consisting of a courier and two agents in 
the highest government circles of Iraq.” SIS was also 
alleged to have “an important agent” in Egypt “with 
access to President Nasser,” and “sub-sources” who 
included the foreign minister of one Middle Eastern 
country and the army chief-of-staff of another.^ ^ 

Operation RUBIN also revealed that SIS had penetrated 
the Lebanese Communist Party. Its most important 
penetration agent was a lawyer who was a member of the 
Party’s Politburo and a personal friend of its general 
secretary, Nicolas Chaoui. On September 27, 1967 the 
Centre informed the Soviet Politburo that, in addition to 
keeping SIS well informed on the affairs of the Lebanese 
Communist Party, the lawyer had provided intelligence on 
contacts between the Party leadership and the retiring 
Soviet ambassador, and on Soviet involvement in the 
affairs of the Lebanese and Syrian peace movements and 
of the Cairo Peace Conference. The Centre, however, was 
reluctant to warn Chaoui that one of his closest associates 
was an SIS agent, probably for fear that he would 
confront the agent, who in turn would alert SIS to the 
penetration of its operations. 

In 1971, a year after SIS had discovered the bugging of 
its Beirut station, the Soviet Politburo gave permission for 
Chaoui to be briefed during a visit to Moscow. At a 
meeting in the international department of the CPSU on 



December 25, Pavel Yefimovich Nedosekin, a senior 
FCD officer, informed Chaoui that the lawyer was 
regarded by SIS as “one of its very valuable agents” and 
had given it secret information about the Lebanese 
Communist Party and two of the most important Soviet 
front organizations, the World Peace Council and the 
Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee. Though doubtless 
somewhat shocked, Chaoui admitted that, as early as 
1949, he had received a report of a confidential meeting 
between the lawyer and a British consul; he added that 
since 1968 the lawyer had twice been to London, 
ostensibly for treatment to a cataract. Chaoui 
acknowledged that he had no intelligence department 
capable of protecting Party security, and promised to take 
immediate action to set one up.^^ 

Among other unwelcome revelations of operation 
RUBIN was the discovery that SIS had succeeded in 
planting six agents in the KGB, the GRU and the 
Czechoslovak StB. The most important appears to have 
been SHAUN, the owner of an advertising bureau in 
Damascus, who was discovered to be a double agent run 
by Lunn’s deputy, BARITONE. A Centre damage 
assessment concluded that SHAUN had compromised a 
series of KGB operations in which he had taken part, 
among them the recruitment of the Spanish cipher clerk 
GOMEZ (arrested after his return to Spain); the attempted 
recruitment of an unidentified member of the West 
German embassy in Damascus; and contacts between the 



Soviet military attache and the chief of the Syrian general 
staff. SHAUN had also reported to SIS on an affair 
between the KGB resident in Damascus and the wife of a 
Soviet doctor. Andropov was tersely informed that 
“measures have been taken to neutralize the consequences 
of SHAUN ’s treachery. 

In January 1967 ZOLUSHKA also succeeded in 
placing a bug in BARITONE’S office in the SIS Beirut 
station. In addition to running SHAUN, he was 
discovered to have sixteen agents inside the Lebanese 
Communist Party and other left-wing organizations. A 
detailed study of the SIS officers in Lebanon, Jordan, 
Syria and elsewhere identified through the bugging of the 
Beirut station led the Centre to draw a number of general 
conclusions which, surprisingly, it does not seem to have 
fiilly grasped before. The report on operation RUBIN 
concluded, correctly, that the cover posts occupied by SIS 
officers in British embassies were rarely as high as 
counselor and never higher; most were first, second or 
third secretaries, and seldom headed any of the main 
embassy departments such as trade and information. SIS 
personnel did not keep to the daily diplomatic routine, 
spent more time outside the embassy, lived in worse 
accommodation, drove older cars and gave fewer large 
receptions at their homes than British diplomats, but had 
higher expense allowances and arranged more meetings in 
restaurants and other public places. Philby had doubtless 
made such points before, but KGB debriefers still tended 



to seek only detailed classified information from agents 
and defectors and failed to use them to add to their 
general understanding of the West. By the late 1960s 
Philby was, unsurprisingly, deeply depressed and drinking 
heavily, convinced that the KGB had “no idea” of how to 
profit from his vast experience.^^ 

In 1967 ZOLUSHKA was rewarded for her work as a 
KGB agent with the secret granting of Soviet citizenship. 
For the next four years she continued to provide classified 
documents and other intelligence from the British 
embassy and the SIS station in Beirut. In 1971, after she 
had been questioned about the discovery of the radio 
microphones, she was hurriedly exfiltrated to the Soviet 
Union, settled in Armenia and given a modest pension of 
120 roubles. In 1978, after the Armenian KGB reported to 
the Centre that the pension was insufficient, Andropov 
approved an increase to 180 roubles. 

BECAUSE OF THE closeness of Anglo-American 
intelligence cooperation, eavesdropping on the SIS Beirut 
station also produced intelligence on the CIA. The KGB 
discovered plans for, and was able to forestall, a joint 
CIA/SIS operation to bug the Beirut bureau of Novosti.^^ 
In 1969 the KGB residency began an operation which, it 
was hoped, would penetrate the CIA station (codenamed 
OMUT (“Whirlpool”))^^ as successfully as ZOLUSHKA 
had penetrated that of SIS. On KGB instructions, one of 



its Lebanese agents, a hotel owner codenamed MARAT, 
founded an employment agency designed to attract maids 
and domestic servants who could be used in operations 
against the Main Adversary. The most promising 
applicant to the agency was Mary Matrosian (codenamed 
VERA), a Lebanese maid from an Armenian family living 
in Syria. Until 1967 she had worked in the American 
ambassador’s residence in Beirut, but had taken refuge 
with her family in Syria after the outbreak of the Arab — 
Israeli Six Day War. On her return to Beirut in 1969, 
MARAT ’s agency found her domestic work with a series 
of American diplomatic families. VERA was recruited by 
MARAT under a false flag to provide information on her 
employers and remove papers from their homes. MARAT 
told her the information was needed by Armenian 
community and church leaders in order to keep them 
informed of potential threats to the security of the 
Armenian people. In 1971 MARAT handed her over to a 
controller from the Beirut residency, who posed as a 
fellow Armenian. With VERA’s (possibly unwitting) 
help, the KGB succeeded in bugging the apartment of the 
CIA officer for whom she worked.^^ 

KGB files record a number of other KGB attempts to 
bug CIA stations, though none seems to have been as 
successful as operation RUBIN. Among the most 
vulnerable US embassies was that in Conakry, the capital 
of Guinea. One of the files noted by Mitrokhin contains a 
brief reference to the successful bugging of an American 



diplomat’s apartment in Conakry in 1965.^^ Much fuller 
details are available on the bugging of the Conakry 
embassy during the 1970s, when sub-Saharan Africa 
became for the first time a priority area for both Soviet 
foreign policy and KGB operations.^^ In December 1972 
a Guinean employee of the embassy recruited by the KGB 
(code-named successively RUM and SANCHO) 
succeeded in installing a radio-operated eavesdropping 
device in the office of the ambassador, Terence Todman 
(succeeded in May 1975 by William Harrop). 
RUM/S ANCHO was instructed that, if detected, he was to 
tell his interrogators that he had been paid to place the 
bug by a Chinese diplomat whose visiting card he was 
given. The bug (replaced by an improved version in 
January 1974) was so well concealed, however, that it 
went undetected during three annual checks on embassy 
security. The KGB monitoring post which recorded 
Todman’ s dictation and conversations with embassy and 
CIA staff (operation REBUS) was situated in an 
apartment only thirty meters from the ambassador’s 
office. 

The voice-activated bug was sometimes activated by 
Todman’ s engaging habit of bursting into song or 
whistling cheerfully to himself. In general, however, 
operation REBUS provided what the Centre considered 
information “of great operational value” on US policy to 
African liberation movements as well as on State 
Department assessments of Soviet- American relations and 



Soviet policy in Africa. The volume of intelligence was so 
large that two English-speaking operations officers, 
Anatoli Mikhaylovich Zheleznoy and Yuri Yefimovich 
Tatuzov, were seconded from the KGB residency in 
Addis Ababa to process it. In July 1975 bugged 
conversations in the ambassador’s office revealed that the 
embassy was aware there had been a leak in its 
communications with Washington and had asked the State 
Department for help in reviewing embassy security. 
Though strongly tempted to remove the bug, the Conakry 
residency decided not to do so for fear of compromising 
RUM/S ANCHO. According to a KGB damage 
assessment, when the bug in the ambassador’s office was 
discovered in September, “suspicion fell entirely on the 
Guinean Special [Intelligence] Services.” 
RUM/S ANCHO went undetected and remained on the 
embassy staff. 

The KGB’s most ambitious bugging operation against a 
US diplomatic mission during the later Cold War was the 
bugging of a new eight-storey Soviet-built embassy 
building in Moscow on which construction began in 1979. 
The CIA was warned in 1980 by a defector from the 
Eighth Chief Directorate, Viktor Sheymov, that “the KGB 
was going to make the building itself a giant system of 
sensors that could pick up virtually anything.” Officials in 
Washington, however, rashly concluded that any sensor 
installed by the KGB could be detected and removed 
before it was used. Five years later they discovered they 



had made an expensive mistake. Further investigation 
revealed a series of highly sophisticated bugs built into 
the fabric of the building which made it, according to a 
member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, “an 
eight-storey microphone plugged into the Politburo.” 
Steel-reinforcing rods set into the concrete were designed 
to serve as antennae. A power source, codenamed 
BATWING by the CIA, which was discovered embedded 
in a concrete wall, was estimated to be able to last for a 
century. One US official, interviewed by the Washington 
Post, commented, “Our technical people were astounded 
at the level of sophistication. One man from the CIA said, 
‘These are the kind of things that are only on the drawing 
boards here.’ ” For the KGB as well as the State 
Department, however, the operation ended in expensive 
failure. The new embassy building was never occupied.^ ^ 

MOST EAVESDROPPING OPERATIONS using bugs 
planted in foreign embassies or overseas targets were 
short-term, unlikely to last more than a few years. By the 
late 1960s the FCD’s most important and long-term 
SIGINT operations were run by specialized posts within 
its residencies in foreign capitals which intercepted local 
telephone and radio communications. The earliest such 
intercept post appears to have been that set up in the 
Mexico City residency in 1963. Codenamed RADAR, it 
was given the task of intercepting the communications of 
the US embassy and CIA station, but had only limited 



success. The most successful of the residency posts 
created to intercept the communications of the Main 
Adversary were those set up in the United States itself. 
The first, codenamed POCHIN (“Start” or “Initiative”), 
started life in 1966 on the top floor of the Soviet embassy 
on Sixteenth Street in Washington, a few blocks from the 
White House. In 1967 a similar post, codenamed PROBA 
(“Test” or “Trial”), was established by the New York 
residency. There were eventually five POCHIN intercept 
posts in various Soviet establishments in and around 
Washington and four PROBA posts in the New York 
region.^^ 

By 1970 POCHIN- 1 (at the embassy) and POCHIN-2 
(in the embassy residential complex) had transformed 
intelligence collection by the Washington residency. 
According to Oleg Kalugin, head of Line PR: 

We were able to overhear the communications of the 
Pentagon, the FBI, the State Department, the White 
House, the local police, and a host of other agencies. 
These communications all were broadcast on open, 
non-secure channels, but nevertheless a surprising 
amount of useful material was relayed over the 
airway s.^^ 

Among the intelligence which most impressed the Centre 
was secret data on the vetting of ninety candidates for 
posts in the first Nixon administration. In 1969-70 



twenty-three POCHIN intercepts were considered 
sufficiently important to be shown to leading members of 
the Politburo. 

During the same period PROS A- 1 (in the Soviet 
mission to the UN) and PROBA-2 (in the large embassy 
“dacha” at Glen Cove on Long Island) intercepted 
diplomatic traffic sent and received by the UN missions 
of Argentina, Brazil, Canada, France, Portugal, Spain and 
Venezuela, as well as some US military cables and the 
communications of Radio Liberty and Radio Free Europe. 
According to the PROBA files, the intelligence from these 
intercepts was given “a high evaluation” by both Foreign 
Minister Gromyko and the Soviet UN representative, 
Yakov Malik. 

THE KGB’S SIGINT operations against the Main 
Adversary were greatly assisted by a series of agents and 
defectors — all of them walk-ins — with access to highly 
classified intelligence on American cryptanalysis and/or 
cipher systems. In I960 two NSA employees, Bemon F. 
Mitchell and William H. Martin, who had made contact 
with the KGB a year earlier in Mexico City, were 
exfiltrated by the FCD to Moscow, where they continued 
being debriefed for several years. In 1963 Staff Sergeant 
Jack E. Dunlap committed suicide after several years 
spent smuggling top secret documents out of NSA 
headquarters at Fort Meade for the GRU. Shortly before 
Dunlap’s suicide, another NSA defector, Victor Norris 



Hamilton, arrived in Moscow. In 1965 Robert Lipka, a 
young army clerk at NS A responsible for the shredding of 
highly classified documents, began handing many of them 
over to the KGB. Lipka is the last KGB agent inside the 
NS A identified in the files seen by Mitrokhin. (A retired 
NS A employee, Ronald Felton, was, however, to provide 
valuable intelligence to the Washington residency in the 
early 1980s.) Shortly after Lipka left NSA in 1967, Chief 
Warrant Officer John Walker, a communications watch 
officer on the staff of the commander of submarine forces 
in the Atlantic (COMSUBLANT), began an eighteen-year 
career as a KGB agent, supplying detailed information on 
US naval ciphers.^^ 

During the late 1960s both the New York and 
Washington residencies had a series of other striking 
SIGINT successes. Late in 1969 operation PRESSING, 
run by the New York residency, succeeded in concealing 
remote-controlled radio transmitters in UN offices used 
by the chairman of the Security Council. The devices, 
hidden in wooden boards, were fixed beneath bookcases 
and constructed from Western materials to conceal their 
Soviet origin. Simultaneously, operation KRAB, which 
almost certainly had to be approved by the Politburo, 
succeeded in bugging the secretariat of the UN secretary- 
general, U Thant (codenamed BROD). A radio-controlled 
eavesdropping device was also concealed in the offices of 
the Ghanaian mission to the UN.^^ 

In 1969 the Washington residency succeeded in 



concealing a remote-control radio-operated bugging 
device in the meeting room of the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee. The device, once again constructed 
from Western materials, continued to function for at least 
four years. In February 1973 information (which may 
have been inaccurate) reached the residency from press 
sources that a bug had been found attached to the 
underside of the press table in the Foreign Relations 
Committee room. The KGB was puzzled by the report 
since its own listening device was fixed beneath the seat 
of a chair rather than under the table and still appeared to 
be functioning normally. Expecting its bug to be 
discovered. Service A prepared a story claiming that it 
had been placed by the DGSE, the French foreign 
intelligence service. To the KGB’s surprise, however, the 
media lost interest in the episode and no report of the bug 
beneath the chair appeared in the press.^^ 

EARLY IN 1968 the KGB achieved its most important 
penetration of British SIGINT operations since John 
Caimcross had entered Bletchley Park in 1942. Corporal 
Geoffrey Arthur Prime, then working in the RAF SIGINT 
station at Gatow in West Berlin, handed a message to a 
Russian officer at a Soviet checkpoint asking Soviet 
intelligence to make contact with him. Prime’s note was 
passed not to the FCD but to the comparatively lowly 
KGB Third Directorate, whose main responsibility was 
the surveillance and security of Soviet armed forces but 



which sometimes succeeded in making (usually low- 
level) recruits among Western troops stationed in 
Germany. Anxious to steal a march over the more 
prestigious FCD by gaining the credit for Prime’s 
recruitment, a Third Directorate officer left him a 
message, inviting him to a rendezvous in East Berlin, in a 
small magnetic cylinder attached to his car door. At the 
meeting which followed and at subsequent rendezvous. 
Prime agreed to work as a KGB agent but explained that 
his service with the RAF was due to end in August 1968. 
In agreement with his Third Department case officers he 
applied, successfully, for a job processing Russian 
intercepts at GCHQ, the British SIGINT agency. 

Prime was a sexual and social misfit who blamed many 
of his problems on the capitalist system and, as he later 
acknowledged, developed “a misplaced idealistic view of 
Russian Communism.” He was, however, skillfully 
handled by his controllers. In September 1968, before 
taking up his job in GCHQ, Prime spent a week in the 
KGB compound at Karlshorst in the East Berlin suburbs 
being trained in radio transmission, cipher 
communications, microdots, photography of documents 
with a Minox camera and the use of dead letter-boxes. 
Before flying to Britain, he was given a briefcase 
containing a set of one-time cipher pads, secret writing 
materials and 400 pounds in banknotes. He continued 
working as a Soviet agent in GCHQ for almost nine years, 
spending most of his time transcribing and translating 



intercepts. Among the intelligence supplied by Prime 
during his final year working for GCHQ in 1976-7 were 
details of British successes and failures in decrypting 
Soviet traffic. Though his GCHQ colleagues were struck 
by his morose appearance, they put it down to his 
unhappy marriage and failure to be promoted.^ ^ 

The expansion of KGB SIGINT operations during the 
late 1960s led to a reorganization at the Centre. Hitherto 
the KGB Eighth Directorate had handled SIGINT as well 
as ciphers and communications. Probably in 1968 
Andropov established a new Sixteenth Directorate,^^ 
headed by Nikolai Nikolayevich Andreev, to specialize 
exclusively in SIGINT. Its operations were among the 
most highly classified in the whole of the KGB. The 
Sixteenth Directorate worked closely with the Sixteenth 
Department of the FCD, founded at about the same time, 
which was given responsibility for residency intercept 
posts, operations to acquire foreign codes and ciphers and 
attempts to penetrate other SIGINT agencies.^^ On May 
15, 1970 Andropov approved a plan for radio-intercept 
posts (some were already functioning) in fifteen 
residencies: Washington, New York, Montreal, Mexico, 
Tokyo, Peking, Teheran, Athens, Rome, Paris, Bonn, 
Salzburg, London, Reykjavik and Belgrade. During 1971 
these fifteen posts intercepted a total of 62,000 diplomatic 
and military enciphered cables from 60 countries, as well 
as more than 25,000 plain text messages. 



The most important intercept posts, operated by the 
Sixteenth Department with the assistance of OT 
personnel, remained the Washington area POCHIN and 
New York PROBA stations. The most striking 
achievement of the POCHIN stations during the 1970s 
was the interception of many of the messages exchanged 
between Washington, via Andrews Air Force Base, and 
the aircraft taking the President, Secretary of State and 
other senior members of the administration on overseas 
trips. ANTON, one of the POCHIN operational officers, 
was awarded the Order of the Red Star for his success in 
intercepting US communications during Kissinger’s visit 
to London in July 1974 for talks with the British Foreign 
Secretary (and future prime minister), James Callaghan.^^ 
The Centre’s particular interest in these intercepts 
doubtless derived from the fact that the main purpose of 
Kissinger’s visit was to brief Callaghan on Nixon’s recent 
visit to Moscow — his last foreign trip before his 
resignation at the height of the Watergate scandal.^^ Soon 
afterwards the PROBA stations succeeded in intercepting 
Kissinger’s telephone conversations with Callaghan and 
the Turkish foreign minister. Professor Turan Ganes, 
during the crisis caused by the Turkish invasion of 
northern Cyprus on July 21.^^ The KGB was thus able to 
monitor the dramatic way in which, as Kissinger later 
recalled: 


During the night of July 21-22, we forced a cease- 



fire by threatening Turkey that we would move [US] 
nuclear weapons from forward positions — especially 
where they might be involved in a war with 
Greece.^^ 

Not all the intercepts of Kissinger’s conversations 
concerned affairs of state. On one occasion he was heard 
talking to his fiancee, Nancy Maginnes, shortly before 
their marriage in 1974. According to Kalugin’s somewhat 
censorious recollection: 

He apparently had just given a speech and, in his 
egotistical way, was asking her what she thought of 
it. He was saying, in effect, “How did I look? You 
really thought I sounded well?” The transcript 
showed Kissinger to be a vain and boastful man. 

Word came back from Moscow that Andropov “loved the 
intercepted conversation.” He enjoyed boasting to some 
of his Politburo colleagues that the KGB was able to 
eavesdrop on the intimate conversations of the US 
National Security Adviser.^^ 

THE COMPLEX ANTENNAE sprouting on the roofs of 
Soviet missions gradually alerted Western SIGINT 
agencies to the presence of the intercept stations within. 
Though probably unaware the KGB had successfully 
gained access to his own communications, Kissinger 



protested to Ambassador Dobrynin on August 15, 1975 at 
the interception of radio and telephone conversations by 
the Soviet embassy. The Centre drafted a robust reply: 

It is advisable that, when there is a meeting with 
Kissinger, if he again raises that issue, the Soviet 
ambassador should state that the antennae set up on 
the Soviet embassy’s roof are being used on the basis 
of the principle of [diplomatic] reciprocity to ensure 
communications with Moscow, as well as to receive 
general radio and television transmissions. These 
antennae are in no way a contradiction of the 
embassy’s status. It should be brought to the 
attention of the Secretary of State that the US 
government should prevent the installation of 
equipment, including that on buildings close to the 
embassy, which would impede the normal operation 
of the USSR embassy’s radio station.^ ^ 

Kissinger was inhibited in pursuing his protest by the 
knowledge that NS A also ran SIGINT operations from the 
US embassy in Moscow. In 1971 columnist Jack 
Anderson had revealed in the Washington Post that the 
embassy had succeeded in intercepting the microwave 
radio and telephone communications exchanged between 
the large black ZIL limousines of Politburo members as 
they sped around Moscow.^^ Kissinger seems, however, 
to have been genuinely alarmed by the electronic 



countermeasures taken to frustrate SIGINT operations run 
from the Moscow embassy. In November 1975 he told 
Dobrynin that it was believed that the American 
ambassador, Walter Stoessel, had developed leukemia as 
a result of prolonged exposure to electromagnetic 
radiation directed against the embassy. On instructions 
from Moscow, Dobrynin replied that the electromagnetic 
field around the embassy did not exceed Soviet health 
standards. Dobrynin claims that he was privately 
informed by the State Department during the Carter 
administration that a study had concluded that there was, 
in fact, no evidence of damage to the health of embassy 
personnel. 

Kissinger’s protests failed to halt the continued 
expansion of POCHIN and PROBA operations. 
Summaries and transcripts of POCHIN intercepts grew 
from 2,600 pages in 1975 to 7,000 in 1976. During these 
two years 800 reports based on the intercepts were cabled 
to the Centre from the Washington residency. Among the 
communications to and from Andrews Airforce Base 
intercepted during 1976 were important messages dealing 
with Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld’s visits to the 
NATO Nuclear Planning Group in January and June, and 
to US armed forces headquarters in Europe in February; 
and on Kissinger’s meetings with British, French, West 
German and South African leaders. In 1977 POCHIN 
summaries and transcripts increased again to over 10,500 



pages, covering foreign visits by, among others, Vice- 
President Walter Mondale and Secretary of State Cyrus 
Vance. For much of the Carter administration the 
POCHIN posts also intercepted a substantial amount of 
State Department material; the KGB kept a card file on all 
the officials mentioned in it.^^ 

Given the KGB’s lack of high-level penetration agents 
in Washington during the 1970s, it seems likely that 
POCHIN and other SIGINT operations were the Centre’s 
most important source of intelligence on the foreign and 
defense policies of the Ford and Carter administrations. 
The general effect of this intelligence was probably 
benign — to limit the natural predisposition of the Centre 
to conspiracy theories about American policy. During the 
1979 crisis caused by American protests at the presence 
of a Soviet “combat brigade” in Cuba, for example, 
POCHIN intercepts of Pentagon telephone discussions 
and other communications enabled the Washington 
residency to reassure Moscow that the United States had 
no plans for military intervention. 

The most important intelligence provided by the 
POCHIN stations during the 1970s and early 1980s, 
however, was probably military. The intercepts provided 
highly classified information on the Trident, MX, 
Pershing-2, Cruise and surface-toair missile systems; the 
F-15, F-16, F-18, B-52 and B-1 aircraft; and the AW ACS 
early warning system. From 1973 onwards the main 



priority of the New York PROBA stations was also 
scientific and technical intelligence, particularly in the 
military field. Its most striking success during the 
remainder of the decade was the interception of fax 
communications from the Brookhaven National 
Laboratory on Long Island and a series of major 
companies, among them Boeing, Fairchild, General 
Dynamics, Grumman, Hughes, IBM, Lockheed and 
Sperry Rand. Fax intercepts on military projects included 
important material on the design and development of the 
A-10, B-1, EF-lllA and F-14 aircraft; the anti-missile 
defense program; and the anti-submarine defense system. 
By 1976 an intercept post, codenamed VESNA 
(“Spring”), was operating in the San Francisco residency, 
successfully intercepting fax and telephone 
communications of defense contractors and other high- 
tech companies on the West Coast.^^ 

The KGB residencies in New York, Washington and 
San Francisco also had radio-intercept posts (codenamed, 
respectively, RAKETA, ZEFIR and RUBIN) which 
monitored FBI (codenamed FIRMA) communications in 
order to keep track of surveillance of its operations. In 
New York during the 1970s the RAKETA post monitored 
continuously six FBI shortwave radio communications 
channels. Its eavesdroppers quickly became used to 
Bureau jargon. According to a report in KGB files: 


FBI look-out posts and surveillance teams 



communicate using simple codes, slang expressions 
and pre-arranged phrases which are easily 
deciphered by the RAKETA operator. Conversations 
between the look-out posts and a surveillance team 
consist of short dialogues in which the post informs 
the team of the target’s number and the direction he 
is moving in up to an intersection and beyond. 

Daily radio intercept of the operation of the FBI 
dispatch center provides a picture of the operational 
environment and the FBI’s conduct of operations in 
the city. Whenever the [KGB] residency is 
conducting an operation in the city, the RAKETA 
operator monitors the operation of the FBI’s radio 
center; if necessary, an operations officer can be 
given a danger signal prior to his going out to the site 
where an operation is to be conducted, [or told] to 
back off from an operation if he has been detected by 
surveillance. The RAKETA post makes note of local 
citizens who have come to the attention of the FBI, 
and they are put on file in the KONTAKT system 
[the FCD’s computerized name-trace system]. 

For several years the New York residency deluded itself 
into believing that it was able to detect every instance of 
street surveillance of KGB personnel by the FBI.^^ In 
1973, however, it realized that it had been taken in. 
Having discovered that the FBI was aware of the activities 
of some of its operations officers, as well as of three 



“developmental” agents, it finally grasped that the 
apparent simplicity of FBI surveillance techniques was 
actually a means of diverting the residency’s attention 
from far more sophisticated methods which it had failed 
to detect. The residency’s operations were temporarily 
disrupted as it tried to come to terms with methods of 
surveillance it did not fully understand. 

THE RUNNING COSTS for the main intercept posts in 
KGB residencies around the world in 1979 show that the 
Washington and New York operations were by far the 
most expensive. The SIGINT post in the Havana 
residency, the third most expensive, was also focused 
chiefly on the United States. All other intercept posts 
were also instructed to give priority, when possible, to the 
communications of the Main Adversary. The most 
important of the KGB’s foreign intercept posts targeted 
on the United States from outside, however, was located 
not in a residency but in the large SIGINT base set up by 
the GRU at Lourdes in Cuba in the mid-1960s to monitor 
US navy communications and other high-frequency 
transmissions.^^ On April 25, 1975 a secret Soviet 
government decree (no. 342 — 115) authorized the 
establishment of a new KGB SIGINT station (codenamed 
TERMIT-P) within the Lourdes base, which began 
operations in December 1976. Run by the Sixteenth 
Directorate, TERMIT-P had a fixed 12-meter dish 



antenna and a mobile 7-meter dish antenna mounted on a 
covered lorry, which enabled it to intercept microwave 
communications “downlinked” from US satellites or 
transmitted between microwave towers.^^ Other large 
GRU/Sixteenth Directorate SIGINT stations established 
in the late 1970s included those in South Yemen and at 
Cam Ranh Bay in Vietnam. The biggest, however, 
remained the Lourdes complex, which continued to grow 
steadily over the next decade. President Reagan declared 
in 1983: 

The Soviet intelligence collection facility less than 
100 miles from our coast is the largest of its kind in 
the world. The acres and acres of antennae fields and 
intelligence monitors are targeted on key US military 
installations and sensitive activities. The installation, 
in Lourdes, Cuba, is manned by 1,500 Soviet 
technicians, and the satellite ground station allows 
instant communication with Moscow. This 28- 
square-mile facility has grown by more than 60 
percent in size during the past decade. 

A joint report by the Departments of State and Defense in 
1985 estimated that the total personnel at the Lourdes 
SIGINT base had increased further to 2,100.^^ 

By the early 1980s all KGB residencies possessed an 
intercept post.^^ Each post was required to submit an 
annual report to the Centre in November, giving details of 



encrypted and plain text material intercepted over the past 
year; the proportion of operationally significant 
intercepts; newly discovered communications channels of 
intelligence value; characteristics of the “radio- 
intelligence environment” in the country concerned; the 
handling and fulfillment by the intercept post of its 
SIGINT assignments; measures taken to protect the 
security and secrecy of its operations; conclusions about 
past performance and proposals for the future. 

In 1980 the Washington area POCHIN posts reported 
that, as a result of new security precautions, it had become 
much more difficult to intercept the communications of 
the federal government. The residency there, however, 
reported one major new SIGINT success. In September 
1980, after two years’ planning, in an operation 
codenamed FLAMINGO, the residency succeeded in 
bugging the conference room of System Planning 
Corporation (SPC), a private company in Arlington, 
Virginia, which did research for the Pentagon. Viktor 
Vasilyevich Lozenko (code-named MARVIN), a Line X 
(scientific and technological intelligence) officer under 
diplomatic cover at the Washington residency, had 
noticed that the SPC conference room was also used for 
meetings of the Society for Operational Research, of 
which he was a member. The day before he left 
Washington at the end of his tour of duty, he succeeded in 
fixing the listening device — a battery-powered rod a 
quarter of a meter long — underneath a table in the room. 



The signal from the bug was monitored from a command 
post in a car with diplomatic number plates, fitted with a 
T-shaped antenna built into the front windshield, which 
took up position at one of nine locations situated at 
distances of 300-500 meters from the SPC offices. 

For the next ten and a half months operation 
FLAMINGO provided what the Centre considered 
“highly important” intelligence on the current and future 
deployment of US nuclear weapons in Europe, on 
American chemical weapons, on the US navy’s chances 
of survival in a nuclear conflict, and on the US position 
on the SALT-2 talks. On January 27, 1981 a senior 
Pentagon official presented a classified report at a 
meeting entitled “Current Status and Trends in the 
Advancement of the US Nuclear Forces in the Central 
European Theater of War.” Among the issues discussed at 
the meeting were: American mobilization capabilities; the 
effectiveness of laser guidance systems; plans for the 
destruction of 730 tons of chemical weapons which were 
now unusable; and the extent of US intelligence on, and 
requirements concerning, Soviet chemical weapons. Other 
meetings in the bugged conference room, also attended by 
senior Pentagon officials, discussed the current status and 
proposed reforms of the US armed forces. The operation 
came to an end not because the listening device was 
discovered but because its power supply gradually ran 
out.^^ 

Four of the KGB officers involved in operation 



FLAMINGO received the Order of the Red Star: 
Lozenko, who selected the location and placed the bug; 
V. 1. Shokin, who supervised the operation; the head of 
the POCHIN station Yuri Nikolayevich Marakhovsky, 
who played a leading role in collecting and processing the 
intelligence collected from the SPC conference room; and 
Yuri Vasilyevich Gratsiansky, head of the residency’s 
Operational — Technical Support section, who was 
responsible for the technical side of the operation. Three 
other residency officers received lesser awards. 

SOVIEt SIGINT OPERATIONS, like those of the United 
States, were assisted by allied agencies. The UKUSA 
Security Agreement concluded in 1948 between the 
United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia 
and New Zealand provided for the division of collection 
tasks and the sharing of the product between their 
SIGINT services. The KGB, however, was determined 
to give its allies only limited access to its cryptanalytic 
secrets. In January 1975 Andropov approved 
“Regulations on the Principles and Directions of Co- 
operation with the Security Agencies of the Socialist 
Countries in Decryption Operations,” drafted by the 
Sixteenth Directorate. Its two guiding principles were, 
first, that joint operations with the “friends” (allied 
agencies) were to be under KGB control; second, that 
cryptographic information supplied to allied agencies 
“should not disclose the level of the latest [Soviet] 



achievements in the field of cryptanalysis:” 


Bearing in mind that at the present time the related 
services of our friends have acquired a certain 
experience of working on and exploiting [SIGINT] 
targets by the methods of electronic [computer- 
based] cryptanalysis, there is some possibility that in 
future our friends may try to apply these methods 
independently against other targets as well. In these 
conditions, it is essential to strengthen further the co- 
operation between the Sixteenth Directorate and the 
related services of our friends with a view to exclude 
uncontrolled operations which could cause 
irreparable harm to the Sixteenth Directorate with 
regard to the application of the methods of electronic 
cryptanalysis. 

On no account were the “friends” to learn of the existence 
of the top secret training school for KGB cryptanalysts; 
they were to be given the impression that all training took 
place at the Centre. Though, on occasion, allied agencies 
could be given cipher communications from shortwave 
transmissions intercepted by the Sixteenth Directorate, 
they were never allowed access to SIGINT from 
residency intercept posts, satellite communications or 
telegraph lines within the Soviet Union.^^ 

Despite the Sixteenth Directorate’s reluctance to share 
most SIGINT secrets with its intelligence allies, it 



depended on their assistance. With the growing 
complexity of computer-generated cipher systems, Soviet 
cryptanalysts were increasingly dependent on the 
penetration of foreign embassies to steal cipher materials 
and, when possible, bug cipher machines and teleprinters. 
During 1974 alone joint operations by the FCD Sixteenth 
Department and its Soviet Bloc allies succeeded in 
abstracting cipher material from at least seven embassies 
in Prague, five in Sofia, two in Budapest and two in 
Warsaw.^^ Soviet Bloc intelligence services also shared 
some of their agents in Western embassies and foreign 
ministries with the KGB. Among those who were 
particularly highly rated by the KGB Sixteenth 
Directorate was a Bulgarian agent codenamed EPIR, a 
security official in the Greek foreign ministry recruited by 
Bulgarian intelligence in 1966. Over the next ten years he 
assisted in the removal of over 12,000 classified pages of 
documents from the ministry. 

A conference of the KGB leadership in May 1981 
included in its main priorities the recruitment of agents 
from the cipher personnel of the United States, Britain, 
France, West Germany and China. Andropov reaffirmed 
that priority in a special directive issued after he 
succeeded Brezhnev as general secretary in 1982.^^ He 
also approved the secret award of the Order of the 
Friendship of Peoples to the KGB’s longest- serving 
cipher officer agent, JOUR in the French foreign ministry. 



in recognition of his “long and fruitful co-operation” over 
the previous thirty-seven years The FCD Sixteenth 
Department, headed by A. V. Krasavin, had plans to 
create another forty or fifty intercept posts in Soviet 
establishments around the world by the end of the decade. 
It calculated optimistically that the volume of intercepted 
communications would increase by five to eight times its 
present level if the current rate of expansion were 
maintained. 

According to Viktor Makarov, who served in the 
Sixteenth Directorate from 1980 to 1986, the European 
states whose diplomatic traffic was decrypted with 
varying frequency during these years included Denmark, 
Finland, France, Greece, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland and 
West Germany. There was, he believes, no penetration of 
high-grade British cipher systems during that period. An 
inner circle within the Politburo — consisting, in 1980, of 
Brezhnev, Andropov, Gromyko, Kirilenko, Suslov and 
Ustinov — were sent a daily selection of the most 
important intercepts. A larger selection was forwarded 
each day to the heads of the First and Second Chief 
Directorates. Though neither selection is yet available 
for research, both will one day be sources of major 
importance for historians of Soviet foreign policy. 

In addition to obviously important items such as 
Kissinger’s and Vance’s meetings with foreign leaders, 
the intercepts selected for the inner circle of the Politburo 



undoubtedly also included, whenever possible, Western 
responses to their public pronouncements. Vyacheslav 
Ivanovich Gurgenev (alias “Artemov”), deputy head of 
the FCD, complained publicly in 1991: 

Our service has had enough trouble in the past trying 
to collect responses to every “brilliant” initiative by 
our leaders. This kind of work tended to corrupt 
people who started out with the illusion of doing 
something useful. 

Residencies around the world were expected to provide 
prompt reports of favorable responses to every major 
speech by the Soviet leadership. When no such responses 
occurred, they were commonly invented to avoid the risk 
of offending the Politburo. Since the Sixteenth 
Directorate was able, by the later 1960s, to decrypt at 
least some of the diplomatic traffic of over seventy 
states,^^ its chances of finding some suitable response 
among the thousands of decrypts produced each week 
were much greater than those of even the most active 
residency. 

In the ^VQ-glasnost era controversial references to 
Soviet leaders were routinely edited out of translations of 
diplomatic decrypts. Makarov recalls seeing an 
intercepted cable from the Swedish ambassador in 
Moscow in August 1984 discussing the likely power 
struggle which would follow the demise of the ailing 



Konstantin Chernenko. Among the passages removed or 
doctored in the Russian translation was a disparaging 
reference to Gorbachev’s wife, Raisa Maximo vna. On 
another occasion Makarov was ordered to remove from a 
diplomatic telegram he had decrypted the sentence, 
“Gorbachev is like Andropov.” Such excisions were 
known within the Sixteenth Directorate as “minding the 
words. 

DURING THE 1980s SIGINT agencies in both East and 
West began to face two formidable new technological 
challenges: the use of fiber optics in global 
telecommunications and the greatly increased availability 
of highly sophisticated encryption systems. Neither the 
KGB nor any other SIGINT agency seems to have 
devised a system of intercepting messages which passed 
along fiber-optic lines as streams of light. In the late 
1980s Britain installed a highly secure fiber-optic trunk 
system, codenamed BOXER, which linked 200 military 
installations. Simultaneously, the development of Public 
Key Cryptography by mathematicians at the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Weizmann 
Institute in Israel, and subsequent refinements such as 
Phil Zimmermann’s PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) system, 
made ciphers which were difficult, if not impossible, for 
SIGINT agencies to crack, available to anyone with a 
powerful desktop computer and modem. 

The SIGINT-related files seen by Mitrokhin, which end 



in 1982, do not explain how the KGB sought to respond 
to these new challenges. It is clear from other evidence, 
however, that Soviet SIGINT operations continued to 
expand, at least in volume, during the Gorbachev era. 
Those of the GRU, targeted chiefly on the armed forces of 
the United States, NATO and China, were on an even 
larger scale than the KGB’s. By the end of the 1980s the 
Red Army had 40 SIGINT regiments, 170 SIGINT 
battalions and over 700 SIGINT companies. Since the 
launch of Kosmos 189 in 1967, the GRU Space 
Intelligence Directorate had put over 130 SIGINT 
satellites into orbit. More than 60 Soviet surface ships and 
over 20 different types of aircraft were used for SIGINT 
collection. The GRU and KGB had between them over 
500 SIGINT ground stations in the Soviet Union and 
around the world. In all, the GRU and KGB SIGINT 
network probably employed about 350,000 intercept 
operators, processors, cryptanalysts and other technical 
specialists, a majority of them military personnel — about 
five times as many as the NS A and US Service 
Cryptological Authorities, which together had an 
estimated 60,000 to 70,000 personnel. According to 
Vladimir Rubakov, a senior KGB officer interviewed 
shortly before the reorganization of Soviet intelligence in 
1991, SIGINT operations consumed a quarter of the KGB 
budget. 

In December 1991 the former Eighth and Sixteenth 
Directorates of the KGB were reconstituted as an 



independent service, the Federal Agency for Government 
Communications and Information (FAPSI in its Russian 
acronym), responsible for communications security, 
ciphers and SIGINT. Russian SIGINT operations today 
are on a significantly smaller scale than those of the 
former Soviet Union. One of the least noticed 
consequences of the disintegration of the Soviet Bloc was 
the dismantling of the great majority of the 150 ground 
stations in former Warsaw Pact countries. Some of the 
most important stations outside the Russian Federation, 
however, still survive — among them the large SIGINT 
complexes near Tallinn in Estonia and at Lourdes in Cuba 
(though the Lourdes personnel was reduced by over half 
to a total of about 1,000 in 1993).^^ The residencies of the 
SVR, the Russian foreign intelligence service, continue to 
contain active intercept posts. Though FAPSI operates 
with somewhat reduced resources, faces harder targets 
and probably finds it increasingly difficult to match 
NSA’s state of the art technology, Russian SIGINT still 
has a global reach. 



TWENTY - TWO 


SPECIAL TASKS 


Part 1: From Marshal Tito to Rudolf Nureyev 


Assassination had been an integral part of Stalin’s foreign 
policy. During the late 1930s he had been obsessed with 
NKVD operations to liquidate Trotsky and his leading 
foreign supporters. The final act of his foreign policy 
before he died in 1953 was a plan to assassinate Josip 
Tito, who had succeeded Trotsky as the leading heretic of 
the Soviet Bloc. 

At the height of the Terror, Tito (bom Josip Broz) had, 
ironically, been one of the few leading Yugoslav 
Communists (most then living in exile in Moscow) who 
were tmsted by the NKVD. On becoming secretary 
general of the purged Yugoslav Party in 1937, he had 
dutifully denounced his persecuted and liquidated 
comrades, in impeccable Stalinist invective, as 



Trotskyists, traitors, factionalists, spies and anti-Party 
elements. He apologized personally to Stalin for his own 
lack of vigilance in choosing as his first wife a woman 
who had since been unmasked as an (imaginary) Gestapo 
agent. When Tito became wartime leader of the 
Communist partisans, an NKVD agent, Josip Kopinic, 
codenamed VAZHDUH (“Air”), acted as his radio link 
with Moscow. ^ At the end of the war, the NKGB resident, 
Saveli Vladimirovich Burtakov (codenamed LIST), 
presented the head of Tito’s Bureau of People’s 
Protection, Alexander-Leka Rankovic, with a portrait of 
Stalin. Apparently deeply moved, Rankovic (codenamed 
MARKO by the Centre) replied that it was the most 
precious gift he could possibly have received.^ There was 
no sign yet of the violent confrontation between Tito and 
Stalin which was to erupt only three years later. Despite 
his own subsequent loathing for Stalinism, the leading 
Yugoslav communist Milovan Djilas later acknowledged: 

The fact is that not a single Party leader was anti- 

Soviet — not before the war, not during, not after . . . 

Stalin and the Soviet Union were our corner-stone 

and point of spiritual origin . . . ^ 

There were already signs by the end of the war, however, 
that Tito (codenamed OREL (“Eagle”) by the Centre) 
would be less sycophantic to Moscow than most other 
leaders of the emerging Soviet Bloc. Unlike other Bloc 



members, the Yugoslav partisans had defeated the 
Germans and Italians chiefly through their own efforts 
rather than the sacrifices of the Red Army. Tito declared 
ominously soon after VE Day, “We will not be dependent 
on anyone ever again.” Burtakov reported to the Centre: 

Side by side with his positive qualities — ^popularity, 
good looks, an expressive face, spirit and willpower 
— OREL also has the following negative traits: lust 
for power, lack of modesty, arrogance and 
insincerity. He considers himself to be the absolute 
authority, prefers unquestioning obedience, dislikes 
an exchange of views and criticism of his orders; he 
is irritable, hot-tempered and curt; he loves to strike 
poses. 

Burtakov also believed Tito was less than frank about his 
dealings with Britain, “although outwardly he makes a 
show of his supposed hostility towards the Allies, 
especially the British.”^ 

Tito and Rankovic, in turn, took a dim view of 
Burtakov, who became notorious for his habit of looting 
jewelry, crystal, china and rugs from Yugoslav mansions 
(a practice he was to repeat when posted to Romania and 
Czechoslovakia).^ At the end of 1945 Burtakov was 
replaced as chief adviser to the Bureau of People’s 
Protection (OZNA) by Arseni Vasilyevich Tishkov, 
known to the Yugoslavs as Timofeyev.^ 



The post-war MGB had residencies in Belgrade, 
Zagreb, Ljubljana and Skopje, as well as four sub- 
residencies elsewhere in Yugoslavia,^ whose imperious 
behavior caused increasing resentment at Soviet intrusion 
into Yugoslav affairs. An inspection by the Centre 
reported that MGB advisers “interfered roughshod in the 
internal affairs of the Bureau of People’s Protection, and 
applied pressure in order to obtain information.” 
Information refused by OZNA’s leaders was 
surreptitiously obtained from its junior officers.^ What 
caused most resentment in Belgrade, however, was MGB 
recruitment of Yugoslav agents. Tito was unaware that 
two of his own ministers — Andriya Hebrang, minister of 
industry, and Streten Zujovic, finance minister — ^were 
among them. He was, however, outraged at a Soviet 
attempt in 1945 to seduce and recruit Dusica Petrovic, the 
female officer in charge of Yugoslav ciphers. When 
informed of the case by Rankovic, Tito exploded: “A spy 
network is something we will not tolerate! We’ve got to 
let them know right away.”^ Tishkov, however, continued 
to demand from Tito and Rankovic offices for himself 
and the Soviet “advisers” inside OZNA headquarters, 
with the right to be informed of all agent files and 
operations. 

Of all Tito’s early signs of independence, the one 
which caused most alarm in Moscow was probably his 
plan for a Balkan federation — interpreted by Stalin as a 



potential challenge to Soviet hegemony. In March 1948 
the Soviet Union recalled its advisers and angrily 
denounced the Yugoslav Party as riddled with both 
ideological heresy and British spies. On June 28 
Cominform (the post-war successor to Comintern) 
expelled the Yugoslavs and appealed to “healthy 
elements” in the Party to overthrow the leadership. Tito’s 
flattering secret codename OREL (“Eagle”) was hurriedly 
downgraded to STERVYATNIK (“Carrion Crow”).^^ 
Stalin, however, initially overestimated the ease with 
which “Carrion Crow” could be overthrown. “I shall 
shake my little finger,” he boasted to Khrushchev, “and 
there will be no more Tito.” When that failed, “he shook 
everything else he could shake;” but without success. 
Tito’s hold over the Party, army and state machinery 
remained secure. 

In the summer of 1948 the MGB and UDBA (OZNA’s 
successor) began a vicious intelligence war. Hebrang and 
Zujovic, the two Soviet moles in Tito’s cabinet, were 
arrested. Other Soviet agents were discovered in Tito’s 
bodyguard, of whom the most senior was Major-General 
Momo Jurovic (codenamed VAL). According to Djilas, 
the UDBA discovered an MGB plot to wipe out the 
Yugoslav Politburo with automatic rifles while they were 
relaxing in the billiards room at Tito’s villa. The UDBA’s 
use of terror against Cominfom “traitors” rivaled in 
horror, if not in scale, that of the NKVD against Soviet 
“enemies of the people” a decade before. Djilas 



mournfully told Rankovic, “Now we are treating Stalin’s 
followers just as he treated his enemies!” The MGB 
and its allied intelligence services simultaneously engaged 
in a purge of mostly imaginary Titoist conspirators 
throughout the Soviet Bloc. Their most celebrated victims 
were the Hungarian interior minister, Laszlo Rajk, and 
seven alleged accomplices who confessed at a carefully 
rehearsed show trial in Budapest to taking part in a vast 
non-existent plot hatched by Tito and the CIA.^^ 

The final, and most ingenious, of the MGB plans to 
assassinate Tito involved one of the most remarkable of 
all Soviet illegals, Iosif Grigulevich (at this time 
codenamed MAKS or DAKS), who had taken a leading 
part in the first, narrowly unsuccessful, attempt on 
Trotsky’s life in Mexico City in May 1940, had run a 
Latin American sabotage network during the Second 
World War, and in 1951 — posing as Teodoro Castro — 
had become Costa Rican charge d’affaires (later Minister 
Plenipotentiary) in Rome.^^ Since Costa Rica had no 
diplomatic mission in Belgrade, Grigulevich was also able 
to obtain the post of non-resident envoy to Yugoslavia. 
The MGB reported to Stalin in February 1953: 

While fulfilling his diplomatic duties in the second 
half of the year 1952, [MAKS] twice visited 
Yugoslavia, where he was well received. He had 
access to the social group close to Tito’s staff and 
was given the promise of a personal audience with 



Tito. The post held by MAKS at the present time 
makes it possible to use his capabilities for active 
measures against Tito.^^ 

Grigulevich volunteered for the role of assassin. At a 
secret meeting with senior MGB officers in Vienna early 
in February 1953 he suggested four possible ways to 
eliminate “Carrion Crow:” 

1. To administer a lethal dose of pneumonic 
plague from a silent spray concealed in his clothing 
during a personal audience with Tito. (Grigulevich 
would be inoculated with an antidote beforehand.) 

2. To obtain an invitation to the reception for 
Tito to be given during his forthcoming visit to 
London by the Yugoslav ambassador, with whom 
Grigulevich was on friendly terms. Grigulevich 
would shoot Tito with a silenced pistol, then spray 
tear gas at the reception to cause panic and assist his 
escape. 

3. To use the previous method at a diplomatic 
reception in Belgrade. 

4. To present Tito with jewelry in a booby- 
trapped box which would release a lethal poison gas 
as soon as it was opened. 

Grigulevich was asked to submit more detailed proposals 
to the Centre, Meanwhile, the MGB assured Stalin that 
there was no doubt that “MAKS, because of his personal 
qualities and experience in intelligence work, is capable 



of accomplishing a mission of this kind.”^^ 

The use of an accredited Central American diplomat as 
Tito’s assassin was intended to conceal as effectively as 
possible the hand of the MGB. Using his Costa Rican 
alias, Grigulevich composed a farewell letter addressed to 
his Mexican wife to be made public and used to reinforce 
his Latin American cover if he were captured or killed 
during the assassination attempt. On March 1, 1953 the 
MGB reported to Stalin that MAK’s attempt to “rub out” 
Tito had, unfortunately, not yet taken place. This 
disappointing report, which Stalin read at about midnight, 
may well have been the last document he saw before he 
suffered a fatal stroke in the early hours of March 2.^^ 
After Stalin’s death three days later, plans for the 
assassination were suspended. That May Grigulevich was 
hurriedly withdrawn to Moscow when the pre-war Soviet 
defector Aleksandr Orlov began publishing reminiscences 
of Stalin and the NKVD in Life magazine. The Centre 
feared that Orlov, who knew of Grigulevich’ s sabotage 
missions before and during the Spanish Civil War, might 
blow his cover — though, in the event, he did not do so.^^ 
So far as the puzzled Costa Rican foreign ministry and 
Rome diplomatic corps were concerned, Grigulevich and 
his wife simply disappeared into thin air. A note on his 
KGB file in 1980 records that Western intelligence 
services had, apparently, never identified the missing 
Teodoro Castro as the Soviet illegal Iosif Grigulevich. 



Back in Moscow, Grigulevich had successfully completed 
a doctoral dissertation, become a senior scientific 
researcher at the Ethnographic Institute of the Soviet 
Academy of Sciences in 1958, and thereafter made a new 
life for himself as a leading writer and academic authority 
on Latin America, ethnography and religion, becoming 
vice-president of the Soviet — Cuban and Soviet — 
Venezuelan Friendship Societies. 

UNDER KHRUSHCHEV, PLOTS to assassinate Tito 
were replaced by attempted conciliation with Belgrade. 
The public Soviet — Yugoslav conflict was formally 
concluded during a state visit by Khrushchev to Belgrade 
in May 1955. Assassination was far less central to 
Khrushchev’s foreign policy than it had been to Stalin’s. 
It remained, however, as it had done throughout the Stalin 
era, a basic part of Soviet policy for dealing with the 
leaders of anti-Soviet emigre groups: in particular, the 
Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN) and the 
rival Social-Democratic National Labor Union (NTS). As 
Party secretary in the Ukraine, Khrushchev had ordered 
the secret poisoning by the MGB of, among others, the 
nationalist Oleksander Shumsky and of Archbishop 
Romzha of the Uniate (Catholic) church.^ ^ 

The first major foreign assassination target of the post- 
Stalin era was Georgi Sergeyevich Okolovich, one of the 
leaders of the NTS organization in West Germany. The 
training of Okolovich’ s intended assassin, Nikolai 



Khokhlov, was personally overseen by the MGB head of 
foreign intelligence, Aleksandr Semyonovich Panyushkin. 
Khokhlov’s instructors included Mikhail Rubak, a Soviet 
judo champion, and Lieutenant- Colonel Godlevsky, 
winner of five national pistol tournaments. The execution 
weapon was an electrically operated gun, fitted with a 
silencer and concealed inside a cigarette packet, which 
fired cyanide bullets developed in the Centre’s secret 
arms laboratory at Khozyaistvo Zheleznovo. Khokhlov, 
however, proved to be more squeamish than the assassins 
of the Stalin era and was at least half-persuaded by some 
of the NTS publications which he read while plotting 
Okolovich’s assassination. On February 18, 1954 

Khokhlov called at Okolovich’s flat in Frankfurt. His 
introduction was somewhat disconcerting. “Georgi 
Sergeyevich,” he told him, “Fve come to you from 
Moscow. The Central Committee of the Communist Party 
of the Soviet Union has ordered your assassination.” He 
then informed the startled Okolovich that he had decided 
not to murder him. Instead, Khokhlov defected to an 
initially skeptical CIA. On April 20 he gave a sensational 
press conference at which he revealed the assassination 
plan and displayed his exotic murder weapon to the 
world’s media. 

In April 1955, following a prolonged post-mortem at 
the Centre in the wake of Khokhlov’s well-publicized 
defection, “special actions” were made the responsibility 
of the reorganized FCD Thirteenth Department, which 



was represented in residencies by a newly created Line F. 
Its duties were to prepare and conduct sabotage in 
collaboration with the GRU; to carry out other “special 
actions” involving the use of force, ranging from 
kidnapping to assassination; and to steal Western military 
technology (a responsibility later handed over to FCD 
Directorate T on its foundation in 1963).^^ 

SABOTAGE OPERATIONS REPLACED assassination 
as the most important “special actions” of the Thirteenth 
Department during and beyond the Khrushchev era. The 
main priority of these operations consisted of the 
identification of targets in the West and preparations for 
their destruction by Soviet sabotage and intelligence 
groups {diver sionnye razvedyvatelnye gruppy or DRGs) 
and the local Communist “resistance” in the event of an 
East — West conflict. One of Line F’s earliest tasks 
followed the conclusion of the four-power Austrian State 
Treaty, signed in Vienna in May 1955, which ended the 
post-war occupation by the wartime allies. Before the 
withdrawal of the Red Army, the KGB was instructed to 
select and fill a series of secret arms caches. Among the 
many sites recorded in the files examined by Mitrokhin 
were the villages of Mayerling, Mollram, Weinersdorf, 
Heiligenkreuz and Semmering; the Stift Gittweig 
monastery; and two ruined castles, Schloss Starhemberg 
and Schloss Merkenstein. KGB archives contain detailed 
plans and written descriptions of these and other 



locations. The plan of the mins of Schloss Starhemberg, 
for example, shows a 7.65 caliber Walter pistol, with a 
cartridge clip and 2 1 rounds of ammunition, concealed in 
a crack in the outer wall at ground level 1.5 meters to the 
left of an old pine tree; and a 6.35 caliber Walter pistol, 
with a cartridge clip and 21 live rounds, hidden in the 
castle courtyard 1.5 meters from an old pear tree. At 
Schloss Merkenstein a 7.65 caliber Mauser pistol, with 
cartridge clip and 21 rounds of ammunition, was 
concealed in a niche underneath a large stone to the left of 
the gateway arch; a Walter pistol, also with cartridge clip 
and 25 rounds, was hidden in a crevice in the wall.^^ 

In May 1964, the KGB residency in Vienna made a 
sample check of the second Schloss Merkenstein cache, 
and was disturbed to discover that the cover in which the 
arms had been wrapped had rotted away. Four of the 
twenty-one rounds of ammunition had disappeared and 
were assumed to have fallen deeper into the crevice; the 
other seventeen rounds had deteriorated and were no 
longer safe to use. The Walter pistol, once mst had been 
removed, as found to be still serviceable. The Centre 
pmdently decided to leave the other caches undisturbed.^^ 
Potential sabotage targets and landing sites for Soviet 
sabotage and intelligence groups (DRGs) are recorded in 
KGB files with the same meticulous detail as the location 
of the secret arms caches.^^ By 1959, if not earlier, the 
most vulnerable points of power- transmission lines, oil 



pipelines, communications systems and major industrial 
complexes in most, if not all, NATO countries were being 
systematically reconnoitered and marked on the 
Thirteenth Department’s maps. In the summer of 1959 a 
KGB agent obtained a temporary job at an electricity 
substation near Worms in order to assist the preparation 
of plans to sabotage electric power lines crossing the 
Rhine.^^ From October 2 to 30, 1959 a Soviet delegation 
of energy experts, headed by the deputy minister for the 
construction of power plants and including a KGB officer, 
used a visit to the United States to reconnoiter sabotage 
targets in power stations and electricity lines. 

Files on suitable landing sites and bases for the DRGs 
which would attack these and other targets included 
detailed information on the terrain, landmarks, climate in 
different seasons, prevailing winds, populated areas and 
local customs. Where the DRGs were to land by sea 
rather than by air, there were further details on the 
coastline, tides and operating conditions for submarines 
and motor boats. Much of the information was collected 
by local agents and by Soviet citizens who were allowed 
to travel to the West for family reunions. An attempt was 
also made to recruit illegal agents in the main NATO 
countries and Japan to assist the DRGs. According to a 
Thirteenth Department file: 

People who are suitable as special [illegal] agents for 

Line F operations are 20 to 45 years old. Persons 



from aristocratic and bourgeois-conservative circles 
are of no interest. Preference is given to the 
following professions: electricians, mechanics, 
toolmakers, chemists, qualified engineers, 
technicians and highly skilled workers — ^primarily 
citizens of the United States, France, Canada, 

Britain, West Germany, Italy and Japan. People who 
adhere strictly to church dogma and rules are not 
suitable, nor are people with a tendency towards 
alcoholism, drug addiction and sexual deviations. In 
order to provide explanations for the characteristics 
and routines involved in the operations being carried 
out, it is desirable to select people who travel 
frequently around their own country as well as to 
other countries — people who own houses, second 
homes, country dachas, farmsteads and plots of 
land.^^ 

The Thirteenth Department’s preparations for wartime 
sabotage operations inevitably overlapped with those of 
the GRU. The resulting duplication of effort was made 
worse by the traditional rivalry and distrust between the 
two agencies. On April 7, 1960 the CPSU Central 
Committee issued Decision No. P-274-XIVI, calling for 
closer co-ordination between the KGB and GRU. This 
and other exhortations, however, had little practical effect. 
In September 1963 the Centre complained that the 
leadership of the GRU was making no serious attempt to 



co-ordinate its operations with those of the KG B. 

The KGB found it easier to collaborate with the 
intelligence agencies of other Soviet Bloc countries, who 
were usually willing to accept a subordinate role, and 
sought their help in a number of Line F operations. 
According to Markus Wolf, head of the HVA (Stasi 
foreign intelligence) from 1952 to 1986, the Centre 
offered its allies lethal nerve toxins and poisons which 
were fatal on contact with the skin for use during “special 
actions.” Wolf claims that he refused all but a small 
supply of “truth drugs,” which he had analyzed by an 
HVA doctor: 

He came back shaking his head in horror. “Use those 
without constant medical supervision and there is 
every chance that the fellow from whom you want 
the truth will be dead as a dodo in seconds,” he said. 

In his memoirs Wolf seeks to distance himself from KGB 
assassination attempts. He claims, for example, that the 
KGB assassinated Aleksandr Trushnovich, the NTS 
leader in West Berlin, “while attempting to kidnap 
him.”^^ KGB files tell a rather different story. In April 
1954 Heinz Gleske, a Stasi officer operating undercover 
in West Germany, lured Trushnovich to his home, where 
he was kidnapped and handed over to the KGB at 
Karlshorst. Gleske then issued a statement, claiming that 
Trushnovich had become disillusioned with the West and 



had “voluntarily” defected to East Germany. The Centre 
awarded Gleske the Order of the Red Star.^^ 

Even with some assistance from its allies, the KGB’s 
“special actions” against NTS and OUN leaders during 
the Khrushchev era had a mixed record of success — not 
least because of the doubts of its assassins. In an attempt 
to disguise its involvement in an attempt to murder the 
NTS president, Vladimir Poremsky, the Thirteenth 
Department hired the services of a German contract killer, 
Wolfgang Wildprett. Like Khokhlov, however, Wildprett 
had second thoughts, decided not to go ahead with the 
“special action” and in December 1955 informed the West 
German police. In September 1957 a Thirteenth 
Department attempt to poison Khokhlov himself with 
radioactive thallium (chosen in the belief that it would 
degrade and leave no trace at autopsy) also failed. 

These failures, however, were followed by the 
successful assassination of two leading Ukrainian 
emigres: the main NTS ideologist. Lev Rebet, in October 
1957 and the OUN leader, Stephen Bandera, in October 
1959.^^ The Thirteenth Department assassin in both cases, 
only twenty-five years of age when he killed Rebet, was 
Bodgan Stashinsky, who operated out of the KGB 
compound at Karlshorst. His murder weapon, specially 
constructed by the KGB weapons laboratory, was a spray 
gun which fired a jet of poison gas from a crushed 
cyanide ampule and caused death by cardiac arrest. The 
Centre calculated, correctly, that an unsuspecting 



pathologist was likely to diagnose the cause of death as 
heart failure. Stashinsky tested his weapon by taking a 
dog into a wood near Karlshorst, tying it to a tree and 
firing at it. The dog had immediate convulsions and died 
in a few moments. Confident of the deadliness of his 
spray gun, Stashinsky killed both Rebet and Bandera by 
lying in wait for them in darkened stairways. In December 
1959, he was summoned to Moscow. At a ceremony in 
the Centre, Aleksandr Nikolayevich Shelepin, chairman 
of the KGB, read aloud a citation praising Stashinsky “for 
carrying out an extremely important government 
assignment” and presented him with the Order of the Red 
Banner. Stashinsky was told he would be sent on a course 
to perfect his English before being sent on a three- to five- 
year assignment in the West to carry out further “special 
actions. 

Like Khokhlov and Wildprett, however, Stashinsky had 
second thoughts about his career as an assassin, 
encouraged by his East German girlfriend, Inge Pohl, 
whom he married in I960. In August 1961, the day before 
the Berlin Wall sealed off the escape route from the East, 
the couple defected to the West. Stashinsky confessed to 
the murders of Rebet and Bandera, was tried at Karlsruhe 
in October 1962 and sentenced to eight years’ 
imprisonment. The judge declared that the main culprit 
was the Soviet government which had institutionalized 
political murder. Heads were quick to roll within the 
KGB. According to Anatoli Golitsyn, who defected four 



months after Stashinsky, at least seventeen KGB officers 
were sacked or demoted. More importantly, the 
Khokhlov and Stashinsky defections led both the KGB 
leadership and the Politburo to reassess the risks of “wet 
affairs” (assassination attempts). Fearful of attracting 
more of the worldwide publicity generated by Khokhlov’s 
press conference and Stashinsky’ s trial, the Politburo 
abandoned assassination as a normal treatment of policy 
outside the Soviet Bloc, resorting to it only on rare 
occasions such as in the elimination of President 
Hafizullah Amin of Afghanistan in December 1979.^^ 
Among the chief beneficiaries of the KGB’s declining 
enthusiasm for assassination plots was probably Nikita 
Khrushchev. Vladimir Semichastny, then the KGB 
chairman, claims that he was approached in 1964 by 
Leonid Brezhnev, the ringleader of the plot to oust 
Khrushchev, and asked to arrange his “physical 
elimination.” Semichastny refused.^^ He did, however, 
agree to bug Khruschchev’s private telephone lines. With 
the KGB’s assistance, the plotters achieved a substantial 
element of surprise. When Khrushchev left for a holiday 
on the Black Sea in the autumn of 1964, he was seen off 
by smiling colleagues. When he returned on October 13, 
summoned to attend an urgent meeting of the Presidium, 
he was met at the airport only by Semichastny and a 
senior security officer from the KGB. “They’ve all 
gathered in the Kremlin and are waiting for you,” 



Semichastny told him. Khrushchev surrendered to the 
inevitable without a struggle, agreeing to resign on the 
grounds of “advanced age and poor health.” Thereafter, 
he was relegated almost to the status of unperson, not 
mentioned again in the press until Pravda published a 
brief note in 1970 recording his death.^^ 

THOUGH ITS ASSASSINATION operations declined, 
the Centre showed increasing interest during the 1960s 
and 1970s in collaboration with “anti-imperialist” 
guerrilla and terrorist groups in the Third World. In 
January 1961 Khrushchev publicly pledged Soviet 
assistance for “movements of national liberation.” The 
abortive, CIABACKED invasion of Cuba at the Bay of 
Pigs three months later strengthened his determination to 
do so. On August 3 he told a private meeting of Warsaw 
Pact leaders in Moscow, “I wish we could give 
imperialism a bloody nose!”^^ The Centre believed it had 
devised a way to do so which would conceal the role of 
the KGB. 

The aggressive global grand strategy against the Main 
Adversary, devised in the summer of 1961 by Shelepin 
and approved by Khrushchev and the Central Committee, 
envisaged the use of national liberation movements both 
in operations against the United States and its allies and in 
promoting “armed uprisings against reactionary pro- 
Western governments.” At the top of the list of national 
liberation movements cultivated by the KGB was the 



newly founded Sandinista National Liberation Front 
(FSLN) in Nicaragua, which was dedicated to following 
the example of the Cuban revolution and overthrowing 
the brutal pro-American dictatorship of the Somoza 
dynasty. The FSLN leader, Carlos Fonseca Amador, 
codenamed GIDROLOG (“Hydrologist”), was described 
by the Centre as “a trusted agent. Sandinista guerrillas 
formed the basis for a KGB sabotage and intelligence 
group established in 1966 on the Mexican US border with 
support bases in the area of Ciudad Juarez, Tijuana and 
Ensenada. Its leader, Manuel Ram6n de Jesus Andara y 
Ubeda (codenamed PRIM), traveled to Moscow for 
training in Line F operations. Among the chief sabotage 
targets across the US border were military bases, missile 
sites, radar installations and the oil pipeline (codenamed 
START) which ran from El Paso in Texas to Costa Mesa, 
California. Three sites on the American coast were 
selected for DRG landings, together with large-capacity 
dead-drops in which to store mines, explosive, detonators 
and other sabotage materials. A support group codenamed 
SATURN was given the task of using the movements of 
migrant workers (braceros) to conceal the transfer of 
agents and munitions across the border. SATURN’S 
headquarters was a hotel belonging to a Russian-bom 
agent, codenamed VLADELETS (“Proprietor”), in 
Ensenada fifty miles from the US border in the Baja 
California. VLADELET’s two sons, both bom in Mexico 
but assessed by the KGB as “Russian patriots,” owned a 



gas station which was selected as a hiding place for DRGs 
and their equipment as well as a base from which to 
conduct sabotage in the United States. 

Canada in the north, like Mexico in the south, was 
intended by the Thirteenth Department (reorganized in 
1965 as Department V) as a base for cross-border 
operations by DRGs against the Main Adversary. In 1967 
a number of frontier crossings were reconnoitred: among 
them areas near the Lake of the Woods and International 
Falls in Minnesota, and in the region of the Glacier 
National Park in Montana. The KGB believed that one of 
its targets in Montana, the Flathead dam, generated “the 
largest power supply system in the world.” Department V 
identified a point (codenamed DORIS) on the South Fork 
river about three kilometers below the dam, where it 
could bring down a series of pylons on a steep mountain 
slope which would take a lengthy period to repair. It also 
planned a probably simultaneous operation in which DRG 
commandos would descend on the Hungry Horse dam at 
night, take control of it for a few hours and sabotage its 
sluices. 

The state with the largest number of targets, however, 
was almost certainly New York, where DRG’s based 
along the Delaware river, in the Big Spring Park near 
Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and at other locations planned 
to disrupt the power supply of the entire state before 
taking refuge in the Appalachian mountains. In examining 
the target files of the Thirteenth Department and 



Department V, Mitrokhin was invariably struck by the 
thoroughness with which each target had been 
reconnoitred. The file on the port of New York (target 
GRANIT), for example, included details of ships’ berths, 
warehouses, communications systems, port personnel and 
security procedures. As always, the port’s most 
vulnerable points were carefully marked.^^ 

As well as being a base of KGB “special tasks” against 
the United States, Canada was also an important target in 
its own right. Operation KEDR (“Cedar”), begun by the 
Ottawa residency in 1959, took twelve years to complete 
an immensely detailed reconnaissance of oil refineries and 
oil and gas pipelines across Canada from British 
Columbia to Montreal. Each target was photographed 
from several angles and its vulnerable points identified. 
The most suitable approach roads for sabotage operations, 
together with the best getaway routes, were carefully 
plotted on small-scale maps.^^ 

Line F operations in north America were part of a much 
larger strategy. In the event of war with NATO, Moscow 
planned a massive campaign of sabotage and disruption 
behind enemy lines. But sabotage on a more modest scale 
was also envisaged in crises (not precisely defined in files 
seen by Mitrokhin) which stopped short of war. Within 
Europe, residencies in NATO countries and some neutral 
states (notably Austria, Sweden and Switzerland) were all 
expected to make detailed plans for the sabotage of four 



to six major targets a year.^^ In 1964-6, for example, Line 
F in West Germany planned “special actions” against the 
Wilhelmshaven-Wesseling oil pipeline; fuel and lubricant 
depots in Wilhelmshaven and Unterpfaffenhoven; the 
main electrical substations in Brauweiler and 
Rommerskirchen and in the hamlet of Feinau; the NATO 
military transit base in the harbor of Bremerhaven; the 
FRG government war bunker; the Howaldswerft 
shipbuilding docks at Kiel and the Weser A G in Bremen; 
and the main US army arms depot at Misau. On 
instructions from the Centre, the Bonn residency 
purchased uniforms and work clothes, used by 
Bundeswehr soldiers, railway personnel, forestry workers, 
gamekeepers and roadworkers, to be worn as disguise by 
DRG saboteurs, for whom landing sites were selected in 
the Black Forest and Bavaria. Arms and radio equipment 
for use in the sabotage missions were hidden in dead- 
drops near the targets. The standard DRG arms package, 
packed in a container designed for long-term storage, 
consisted of: equipment for blowing up railway track; one 
“Cherepakha” (tortoise) mine with 3 additional explosive 
charges; 4 “Ugolok” devices (purpose not specified in 
Mitrokhin’s notes); explosives designed to destroy the 
main supports of high-voltage power transmission pylons; 
3 6-meterlong detonator fuses; and 2 Karandash 
(“pencil”) detonators with a two-hour delay.^^ Each arms 
cache might include more than one container. Radio 



transmitters and receivers were usually concealed in 
separate caches, sometimes with local currency for use by 
the DRGs. In August 1965, for example, 10,000 
deutschmarks were placed in the TREZUBETS cache 
near Bonn; several attempts to locate it a decade later all 
failed and the money was written off.^^ 

Italy was divided by the Centre into four main zones of 
operations, each with two landing sites and bases for 
DRGs: the foothills of the Alps (with sites near Venice 
and in the Milan-Turin region), the remainder of the north 
(with sites in the Amo valley and the Livomo-Pisa- 
Florence area), the center and the south. Each site for 
parachute landings by DRGs had to be a level area 
without buildings of approximately 1 by 1.5-2 kilometers. 
In each zone, a large arms cache was hidden in land or 
property belonging to an experienced agent; radio 
equipment and money were hidden in dead-drops. The 
Rome residency was instmcted to buy samples of the 
uniforms worn by the armed services, police, carabinieri, 
railway and forestry workers, as well as typical clothing 
of the local inhabitants near the landing sites. For the use 
of DRGs in the most northerly region, the residency was 
asked to acquire badges from Alpine units of the armed 
services. Line F prepared files on power- transmission 
lines, oil pipelines, bridges, tunnels and military 
installations within a 120-kilometer radius of each landing 
site. A four- volume file was prepared on former members 
of the Italian wartime resistance who, it was hoped, would 



assist in sabotage missions.^^ 

Similar sabotage plans were made for all Department 
V’s target countries. Each DRG landing site was known 
as a DOROZHKA (“runway”), each of its bases as a 
ULEY (“beehive”). Among the most sinister remnants 
of the Cold War, still scattered around north America, 
most of western and central Europe, Israel, Turkey, Japan 
and some other parts of the world, are the caches of KGB 
arms and radio equipment intended for use by the DRGs. 
Mitrokhin’s notes include precise details of their locations 
in a number of countries. Some are booby-trapped with 
MOLNIYA (“lightning”) explosive devices designed to 
destroy their contents if the caches are opened, and are 
highly dangerous.^ ^ Indeed, one or more of the caches 
may already have caused explosions mistakenly attributed 
to other causes. 

LATE IN 1998, the Swiss authorities began removing a 
radio cache in woods near Berne identified by 
Mitrokhin,^^ which exploded when fired on by a water- 
cannon. A spokesman for the Federal Prosecutor’s office 
issued a warning that if any further caches were 
discovered, they should not be touched: “Anyone who 
tried to move the [KGB] container would have been 
killed.”^^ In Belgium, radio sets were safely removed 
from three other KGB caches (codenamed ALPHA- 1, 
ALPHA-2 and ALPHA- 5).^^ Given the dangerous 



condition of an unpredictable number of the KGB’s Cold 
War radio and arms caches, the SVR now has no excuse 
for failing to reveal their exact locations to the 
governments of all the countries in which they have been 
hidden. 

In addition to using Line F officers in KGB residencies 
to run or supervise its operations, the Thirteenth 
Department and its successor also had a small group of 
illegals, trained in sabotage techniques and other “special 
actions,” who moved around the world from one sabotage 
target or “wet job” to another.^^ The most active was Igor 
Vitalyevich Voytetsky (codenamed PAUL), who began 
training as an illegal in 1956 at the age of twenty- three. 
Voytetsky ’s father, Gleb Pavlovich Shlyandin, had 
committed suicide at the height of the Great Terror in 
1937. His mother, Sofya Davidovna Rudnitskaya, who 
worked as a music teacher, had remarried Vitali 
Panteleymonovich Voytetsky, a film director in the Gorky 
Film Studio. According to his legend, Voytetesky was 
“Emil Evraert,” the son of a Belgian father, Ernst Evraert, 
and a German mother, Hedwig Marta Althammer. Ernst 
Evraert had lived in Russia since 1933; “Hedwig 
Althammer” did not exist. However, a KGB agent, 
codenamed RAG, who worked for the commune of 
Bellecour in the Belgian province of Hainault, made a 
bogus entry in the commune records which purported to 
show that PAUL and his fictitious mother had lived there 
from October 15, 1943 to December 14, 1944. On the 



strength of this entry and forged identity documents 
provided by the FCD Illegals Directorate S, PAUL 
obtained a Belgian passport in the name of Emil Evraert 
on November 8, 1962, then crossed the Channel to 
England. 

On January 30, 1963, in Dover Register Office, 
Voytetsky married another KGB illegal, Yulia Ivanovna 
Gorankova (codenamed VIRGINIA), who was then able 
to apply for genuine Belgian identity documents to 
replace her forged West German passport. Assisted by 
Gorankova, Voytetsky embarked on a full-time career as 
an illegal working for the Thirteenth Department. His 
first assignment was in Northern Ireland, where he 
selected sites for airborne and maritime landings by 
DRGs. He then reconnoitred landing sites in Scotland, 
where he also identified suitable bases for wartime 
“resistance movements” by Scottish Communists, 
prepared large dead-drops for sabotage equipment, 
identified vulnerable sections of oil pipelines and other 
targets and selected agents for carrying out sabotage 
operations. Over the next decade, before becoming an 
illegal trainer in 1975, Voytetsky carried out similar 
assignments in Austria, Belgium, Canada, France, Greece, 
Hong Kong, Israel, Italy, Spain, Turkey and the United 
States — probably the first ever saboteur’s world tour.^^ 

THOUGH THE FCD greatly expanded its sabotage 
capability during the 1960s, it became increasingly 



confused about the traditional speciality of its “special 
actions” department — the liquidation of “enemies of the 
people” abroad. The targets of most of the assassination 
plots during the 1960s and 1970s recorded in the KGB 
files seen by Mitrokhin concerned the KGB’s own 
defectors, all of whom were sentenced to death for treason 
during secret trials held in absentia. Despite the risks of 
further bad publicity in the West if they were hunted 
down, the Centre was determined not to allow the belief 
to spread within KGB ranks that traitors could escape 
their just deserts: 

The KGB must intensify the spirit of hatred towards 
the enemy and traitors. Significant harm is done by 
the comforting theory that losses are inevitable in 
wars between intelligence services. At meetings and 
in reports, betrayals are sometimes called 
compromises. Compromises, by which is meant 
operational failures, are usually provoked by skillful 
dangles by the enemy. Equating these two concepts 
usually leads to the moral justification of traitors, 
and creates an image of them as victims of the 
intelligence skills of the enemy. Defectors do not go 
unpunished. Their punishment is described in such 
proverbs as: “The traitor Judas is hated everywhere.” 
“A mercenary dog deserves a stake through the 
hearf ’ and “A traitor is his own murderer.”^^ 



Deep concern in the Centre at the damage done by 
Anatoli Golitsyn’s defection from the Helsinki residency 
in December 1961 strengthened its determination to deter 
future defectors. Unaware of the confusion caused inside 
the CIA by Golitsyn’s increasingly extravagant 
conspiracy theories, the KGB regarded his defection as a 
serious setback. His case prompted a major review by 
the Centre of its procedures for liquidating traitors outside 
the Soviet Union. In November 1962 Semichastny, who 
had succeeded Shelepin as KGB chairman, a year earlier, 
approved a plan for “special actions” against a group of 
“particularly dangerous traitors,” jointly drawn up by the 
heads of the First and Second Chief Directorates, 
Aleksandr Mikhailovich Sakharovsky and Oleg 
Mikhailovich Gribanov: 

As these traitors, who have given important state 
secrets to the opponent and caused great political 
damage to the USSR, have been sentenced to death 
in their absence, this sentence will be carried out 
abroad. 

The oldest name on the death list was that of the former 
GRU cipher clerk Igor Gouzenko, who had defected in 
1945. The remainder were more recent KGB defectors: 
Anatoli Golitsyn, Pyotr Deryabin, Yuri Rastvorov, 
Vladimir and Evdokia Petrov, Reino Hayhanen, Nikolai 
Khokhlov and Bogdan Stashinsky.^^ The plan approved 



by Semichastny instructed the Thirteenth Department to 
train assassins to carry out the death sentences on the 
traitors. The FCD Counter-Intelligence Department (later 
Directorate K) was to track them down in their foreign 
refuges, in collaboration with the Second Chief 
Directorate, which would maintain surveillance of the 
traitors’ relatives inside the Soviet Union, monitor their 
correspondence and carry out periodic searches of their 
homes. In Golitsyn’s case it was hoped that he would 
emerge from hiding to give evidence to a Congressional 
committee and provide an opportunity for a KGB 
assassin.^^ 

In 1964 reports appeared in the American press that the 
former illegal Reino Hayhanen, who had betrayed 
“Willie” Fisher (alias “Rudolf Abel”), had been killed in a 
road accident. FCD personnel were informed that the 
“accidenf’ had been arranged by the Thirteenth 
Department. Though KGB had, in reality, no hand in 
Hayhanen’ s death, most foreign intelligence officers were 
taken in by their chiefs disinformation.^^ The truth, 
which the Centre could not bring itself to admit even to its 
own officers, was that it rarely succeeded in tracking 
down any of those on the list of “particularly dangerous 
traitors” and that, even when it did so, it could not devise 
methods of assassinating them which did not carry 
unacceptable risks. 

During the 1960s, the names of several further 



defectors were added to the list of “particularly dangerous 
traitors” to be liquidated abroad. The first was Yuri 
Nosenko, a KGB officer who had made secret contact 
with the CIA in June 1962 while serving on the Soviet 
disarmament delegation in Geneva and who defected to 
the United States in January 1964.^^ Unlike any of the 
other defectors on the 1962 list of “particularly dangerous 
traitors,” Nosenko was imprisoned, though not executed. 
By a terrible irony, however, his jailers were not the KGB 
but the CIA. Golitsyn had claimed that the KGB would 
send a series of bogus defectors in an attempt to discredit 
him. Nosenko, he insisted, was one of them. Tragically, 
Nosenko ’s debriefers, like Angleton, the chief of the 
counterintelligence staff, believed Golitsyn. They paid too 
much attention to some of the apparent gaps and 
discrepancies in Nosenko ’s story — notably the confusion 
over his rank. They also wrongly concluded that some of 
his information was too good to be true — ^particularly his 
accurate report in the wake of Kennedy’s assassination 
that Oswald’s file in the Centre showed that the KGB 
considered him mentally unstable and had declined to use 
him as an agent, despite his period in the Soviet Union. 
And they foolishly regarded as suspicious rather than 
rational Nosenko’s lack of support for Golitsyn’s 
conspiracy theories. Pete Bagley, chief of the 
counterintelligence branch of the CIA’s Soviet Division, 
complained, “[Nosenko] made everything sound less 
sinister than Golitsyn. To me, Golitsyn’s version was 



simply superior.” For four years and eight months 
Nosenko was imprisoned by the CIA in miserable 
conditions, without reading material or human contact, 
while his interrogators insisted he admit that he was a 
KGB plant. Few cases in American intelligence history 
have been so appallingly mishandled. 

The KGB knew nothing of the CIA’s ill-founded 
suspicions. Ironically, while Nosenko was languishing in 
solitary confinement in a prison cell, the Centre was 
working on a plan for both him and Golitsyn to be 
assassinated by the illegal PAUL, if they visited the 1967 
Montreal World Fair (which, for rather different reasons, 
neither did).^^ 

The Centre’s continuing inability to track down its 
traitors was well illustrated by the case of the illegal 
Yevgeni Runge (codenamed MAKS), who defected with 
his wife Valentina Rush (ZINA) to the CIA in Germany 
in October 1967. Following the KGB’s traditional 
practice of using insulting codenames for defectors, 
MAKS was renamed GNIDA (“Nit”). Like his 
predecessors, he was secretly condemned to death in 
absentia. Enormous efforts involving several other Soviet 
Bloc services were devoted to operation TREZOR, the 
long and unsuccessful attempt to track down and liquidate 
Runge. More than fifty of the Runges’ friends and 
relatives in the Soviet Union, East and West Germany 
were placed under surveillance; every item of their 
correspondence which passed through the Soviet Bloc 



was opened and examined; their homes were bugged and 
secretly searched. The Stasi mounted a support operation, 
codenamed COBRA, which set out to cultivate Valentina 
Rush’s sister, Renata Ludwig, and one of her relatives, 
Ernst Buchholz, who lived in West Berlin. After fifteen 
years of failure, operation COBRA was finally 
abandoned. 

The KGB also sought the assistance of other Soviet 
Bloc intelligence services in finding an assassin capable 
of liquidating Runge in north America, where it was 
assumed he had taken refuge. The Centre’s preferred 
candidate was a Hungarianbom West German criminal, 
codenamed JAGUAR, who had been recruited by the 
AVH for “special actions” against anti-Communist 
Hungarian emigres. On July 1, 1968 JAGUAR blew up 
the Danube printing house in Munich, which produced 
emigre publications. He also set fire to the editorial 
offices of two Hungarian emigre newspapers, putting one 
of them out of business. For these operations JAGUAR 
received 40,000 Hungarian forints and 1,000 West 
German marks from the AVH. Impressed by his “special 
actions” in Munich, the KGB decided to employ him for 
operation TREZOR. JAGUAR was shown photographs of 
Runge and his wife and agreed to hunt them down. Once 
he had left for the United States, however, he disappeared 
without trace — together, presumably, with the operational 
funds allocated to him by the KGB. Following 
jaguar’s disappearance, the Centre asked the East 



German Stasi and the Bulgarian DS whether they had 
contacts among American gangsters or mafiosi who 
would take out a contract on Runge. Neither was able to 
suggest a suitable assassin.^^ 

AS WELL AS attempting to liquidate major traitors, the 
Thirteenth Department and Department V were also 
responsible for administering lesser punishments to other 
defectors whose crimes were not considered to merit the 
death penalty. The November 1962 plan for dealing with 
defectors also specified “special action” against the 
world-famous ballet dancer Rudolf Nureyev, who had 
defected at Le Bourget airport in Paris during a tour by 
the Kirov Ballet in 1961.^^ The KGB had begun a 
campaign of intimidation immediately after Nureyev ’s 
defection. On the night of his first major performance 
with a Western company, when he was due to dance the 
part of the Blue Bird in a Paris production of Sleeping 
Beauty, he received emotional letters from both his 
parents and his former ballet teacher, appealing to him not 
to betray the fatherland. Having steeled himself to go 
ahead, Nureyev then found his performance interrupted: 

I had barely come on to the stage . . . when shouting 
and whistling broke out, almost drowning 
Tchaikovsky’s music. I went on dancing the Blue 
Bird, but beyond the haze of the footlights ... I was 
perfectly aware that some communists were trying to 



sabotage the performance. I could hardly hear the 
music and I saw pieces of what looked like glass 
thrown on to the stage at me but I kept on dancing. 

The KGB’s early attempts at intimidation failed. On 
February 21, 1962, amid a blaze of publicity, Nureyev 
made his Covent Garden debut, dancing with Margot 
Fonteyn in Giselle. To those who saw that unforgettable 
performance and the twenty-three curtain calls which 
followed, it was already clear that one of the greatest 
partnerships in the history of dance had been bom.^^ The 
Centre was outraged not merely by the public adulation of 
a notorious defector but also by Nureyev’ s publication a 
few months later of memoirs describing his “leap to 
freedom” in the West. Though the November 1962 plan 
of campaign against leading defectors did not specify the 
nature of the “special action” to be employed against him, 
it was clear from the context that it would henceforth 
involve a good deal more than sprinkling broken glass on 
the stage. Subsequent FCD directives discussed 
schemes (which were never successfully implemented) to 
break one or both of Nureyev ’s legs.^^ 

In the summer of 1970 one of Nureyev ’s best-known 
near-contemporaries, Natalia Makarova, defected from 
the Kirov Ballet during a London season at the Royal 
Festival Hall. The KGB report on the defection 
predictably condemned her as a “politically immature 



individual, with low moral qualities. In reality, the 
main motive for her defection, like Nureyev’s, had been 
the quest for greater artistic freedom. A joint 
memorandum by the heads of the First and Second Chief 
Directorates proposed that, if a way could be found to 
injure Nureyev without the hand of the KGB being 
obvious, a similar “special action” should be undertaken 
against Makarova. As usual, the reference in their 
memorandum to physical injury was expressed in 
euphemistic bureaucratic prose: 

Depending on the results of special actions taken 
with respect to Nureyev, aimed at lessening his 
professional skills, [the KGB] should consider 
carrying out a similar action with respect to 
Makarova, in order to localize the negative effect of 
her forthcoming performances in Britain and the 
United States. If the British propaganda organs are 
activated and information provided by her is used to 
slander Soviet life, additional measures will be 
devised.^^ 

An approach was made by the Centre to the Bulgarian 
intelligence service to seek the possible assistance of one 
of their agents in a company where Makarova was due to 
dance. On one occasion Makarova was slightly hurt in an 
accident behind the stage caused by a beam falling from 
the set. The files seen by Mitrokhin, however, do not 



make clear whether this was the first nearly successful 
“special action” by the KGB against a defecting ballerina 
or merely an act of clumsiness by a stagehand.^^ 

Since the defection of the reluctant assassin, Bogdan 
Stashinshky, in 1960, KGB operations against traitors 
living in the West had been totally unsuccessful. Though 
enormous amounts of time and resources had been 
devoted to tracking down defectors and preparing to kill 
and maim them, the only successful liquidation claimed 
by the Centre, the assassination of Hayhanen, was entirely 
fraudulent. It is just possible that the KGB was 
responsible for the minor injury to Natalia Makarova. But 
the probability is that its pursuit of traitors during the 
decade up to 1970 ended in complete failure.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR DISARMING 
THE MOLNIYA [“LIGHTNING”) 
EXPLOSIVE DEVICE 


Instructions for Disarming the MOLNIYA Explosive 
DeviceFCD Directorate S guidance to residencies on the 
correct procedure for removing radio transmitters from 
booby-trapped caches 

1. When digging out the container from the earth, take 
care not to strike the handle by chance. Dig until the 
upper surface of the container with the handle comes to 
light; remove the board and the plywood which cover the 
container. 

2. The handle must only be turned and the container tilted 
and taken out of the hole after the explosive device has 
been disarmed. 

3. In order to disarm the device, one must have a pocket 
torch battery of not less than 3.5 volts. Attach two wires 
of 30-50 cm length to the battery, with sharp probes at the 
end (a nail or a needle). 

4. Without taking the container out of the cache, place one 
of the battery contacts on the body of the container, and 



the other on the left lock fitting, assuming that the lid of 
the container faces the operator. The contact points must 
be applied after scratching the paintwork on the body of 
the container and on the lock fitting. 

5. When contact is made with the battery, a “click” should 
be heard inside the container; this indicates that the 
explosive device has been disarmed. If there is no “click,” 
check the contact points again and repeat the operation to 
disarm the device. 

6. If when the operation is repeated there is still no 
“click,” it is forbidden to take the container out of the 
cache and the cache must be filled in. To open the 
container and remove the electric detonators from the 
two-way radio: 

• remove the padlocks and lift the lid of the 
container with the key which is inside the container. 
Unscrew the four screws and remove the metal 
casing under which the two-way radio is located in 
the ALIOT packaging; 

• cut each of the wires which connect the 
container with the ALIOT packaging and remove the 
package from the container.

EXAMPLE OF BOOBY-TRAPPED 
RADIO CACHE PUT IN PLACE BY 
THE BERNE RESIDENCY 


On May 15, 1966, the KGB residency in Berne, 
Switzerland carried out an operation to deposit a booby- 
trapped BR-3U agent radio transmitter no. 624471/2329 
in a hiding place codenamed CACHE no. 3. In July 1972, 
the residency was ordered to check the area where the 
transmitter had been buried and to devise an operation to 
remove it. Directorate S sent Berne the following 
description of the route to the cache and of its location: 

Cache No. 3 

Leaving Friburg by the Avenches road. Six 
kilometers from Friburg, the road goes through the 
township of Belfaux. There is a farm standing on its 
own on the right-hand side of the road as you leave 
Belfaux. About 100 meters beyond this farm, a track 
on the right-hand side goes up to a wood on a 
hillock. The entrance to this track is immediately 



opposite a railway crossing. Go up this track to the 
edge of the wood, where there is a large covered 
chapel with the image of a saint and benches for 
sitting. 

A path passes by the chapel on the edge of the 
wood. Take 55 steps along the path from the left- 
hand side of the chapel (as you face it). At that point, 
on the right-hand side, there is a stone pillar 
inscribed with the letters F C, and next to it on the 
left there is a large pine tree (the only one in the 
sector between the chapel and the little pillar). Start 
counting steps again from the edge of the path. 
Proceed at right angles to the path, passing between 
the pine tree and the little pillar. After taking 36 
steps, you will be at the point between two large 
leafy trees, the only ones in the sector. The distance 
between the trees is three paces. The area between 
the trees has been used for the cache. 

If no motor car is available, one can reach the 
cache by rail from Friburg, alighting at Belfaux and 
proceeding on foot. The distance from the Belfaux 
railway station up to the cache is about 1,500 m. 

There are three containers in the cache: a case, a 
waterproof package and a stone. 

The case container has an explosive device which 
was made live by means of the MOLNIYA 
[“Lightning”] system when it was put into the cache. 

A board has been put on top of the case container 



in order to protect the handle when the cache is 
opened. 

Close to the center of the cache, a glass jar has 
been buried 30 cm below the surface, and above the 
suitcase a 1 5 cm length of metal piping has been 
stuck vertically into the earth, the upper end being 5- 
7 cm below the surface. These items were placed 
there for the special purpose of indicating whether 
the cache had been opened by third parties. At the 
same time, they can act as markers during the 
excavation. The overall depth of the cache is 1 m. 

The case contains a BR-3U radio transmitter. 

After inspecting the area, the Berne residency reported 
to the Centre that, because of the lack of leaf cover at the 
site, it would be difficult to conceal signs of excavation. It 
would also be difficult to devise a cover story for the 
presence of operational officers in the area of the cache 
for one or two hours, which might well attract attention. 
Directorate S eventually proposed to the leadership of the 
FCD that the cache be written off, partly because of the 
difficulties of excavation, and partly because the fact that 
the shelf life of the MOLNIYA device had expired might 
make removal of the transmitter hazardous. The proposal 
was approved. 

The cache was eventually emptied in December 1998 
by Swiss Federal police using the finding instructions 
from Mitrokhin’s archive reproduced above. The 



MOLNIYA device was, as Directorate S had anticipated, 
dangerously unstable and exploded when fired on by a 
water cannon.^^ (See illustrations.)

RESIDENCY 


Examples of Radio Caches Put in Place by the Rome 
Residency(a) Description of the Route to the 
MEZHOZERNY (“Inter-lake”) cache and location of the 
cache 

On April 15, 1962, a BR-3U radio transmitter no. 
609072/9126 was placed in a waterproof package in 
the MEZHOZERNY cache. 

The MEZHOZERNY cache is located 30 km from 
Rome in a wooded area between Lakes Albano and 
Nemi, 50 m from the Via dei Laghi, on the right- 
hand side of the road when traveling from Rome to 
Velletri. 

Leave Rome by the Appia Antica, and 17 km later 
(the lower end of Champino airfield) turn left into 
the Via dei Laghi, leading to Velletri. Proceed for 13 
km along the Via dei Laghi up to the 13 km 
milestone and continue in the same direction for 120 



m beyond the 13 km milestone and at that point a 
broad path goes off to the right into a wood. 

Go along this path for 90 m up to a fork where 
there are two paths, continue along the path to the 
right which begins 10 m from four large stones on 
the main path. 

These two paths go round either side of a hillock. 
After following the right-hand path for 1 5 m from 
the point where it branches off, turn left and go up 
the hill for 7-8 m. On the hill and on its slopes there 
are holes, apparently left after trees had been 
uprooted. Among all these holes there is a group of 
four which are side by side. 

The cache in which the load was secreted is a 
square hole which is next to another large hole of 
irregular shape like the figure eight. 

At the bottom of the hole a chamber has been dug 
in the direction of the fork in the paths and it is in 
this that the trunk with the two-way radio has been 
placed. It is covered with earth and stones to a depth 
of 55-60 cm. After the case had been covered with 
25 cm of earth a first marker was placed: two lengths 
of green wire were put across the spot diagonally and 
the case was then covered with another 50 cm of 
earth, when a yellow wire was also placed diagonally 
across the spot; this was then covered with a 55-60 
cm layer of earth. On the opposite side of the hole 
there is a large stone. 



The distance from the Via dei Laghi and Ariccia- 
Rocca di Papa crossroads up to the broad footpath 
when traveling away from Rome is about 1,450 m.^^ 

(THE CACHE WAS emptied by the Rome residency on 
February 6, 1970, apparently because of concern that the 
condition of its contents might be deteriorating and 
becoming unsafe.)^ ^ 

(b) Description of the Route to the MARINO Cache and 
Its Location 

On September 20, 1962, two containers were placed 
on the MARINO cache: a notebook with instructions 
on the removal and packing of the two-way radio, 
and a capsule containing instructions for operating 
the two-way radio together with schedules for two- 
way and one-way communication; all the materials 
were on soft film in English. 

The MARINO cache consisted of a cleft at the 
foot of an ancient tree which had been expanded into 
the root system of the tree. 

The cache was located at a point 6 km along the 
Via dei Laghi after leaving Rome. Proceed along the 
Rome-Albano road, turn left into the Via dei Laghi, 
and continue for 6.3 km. From the 6 km milestone, 
the road begins to turn sharply just in face of the 
Marino hamlet. In the middle of the bend, two 



unmetaled village tracks go off to the left and the 
right of the road. Between the track to the right of the 
road and the road itself there is a sector overgrown 
with tall bushes. Among these bushes there is one 
ancient tree 25 m from the road. The MARINO 
cache is at the foot of this tree in the root system on 
the side opposite to the road, at a depth of 25 cm 
from the surface. 

Two containers are wrapped in cellophane and 
placed in a metal sweet tin measuring 18x10x4 
cm, the edges of which have been stuck down with 
insulating tape. 

The objects have been covered with earth and a 
stone placed on top.^^ 

(The cache was emptied by the Rome residency on 
February 7, 1970.)^^ 

FOR REASONS OF public safety it is impossible to 
publish the locations of any of the KGB radio and 
arms caches which have not been cleared, since an 
unknown number are booby-trapped or in otherwise 
dangerous condition. 



TWENTY - THREE 


SPECIAL TASKS 


Part 2: The Andropov Era and Beyond 


On becoming chairman of the KGB in 1967, Andropov 
immediately announced his intention to revive KGB 
“special actions” as an essential tool of Soviet policy 
during the Cold War. The FCD, he declared, “must take 
the offensive in order to paralyze the actions of our 
enemies and to get them involved in a struggle in 
conditions which are unfavorable to them.”^ Two years 
earlier dissatisfaction with the recent record of the 
Thirteenth Department, which was responsible for FCD 
special actions, had led to its reorganization as 
Department Following Andropov’s call for a new 
“offensive to paralyze the actions of our enemies,” the 
main priority of Department V became “special actions of 
a political nature” — the peacetime use of sabotage and 



other forms of violence in the furtherance of Soviet 
policy.^ Line F officers in residencies were instructed to 
show greater ingenuity in devising special actions in 
which the hand of the KGB would be undetectable. All of 
the newly devised sabotage proposals employed the same 
standardized coded jargon. Each act of sabotage was 
termed a “Lily” (Liliya), the explosive device a “Bouquet” 
(Buket), the detonator a “Little Flower” (Tsvetok), the 
explosion of the device a “Splash” (Zaplyv) and the 
saboteur the “Gardener” (Sadovnik).^ 

The most important special action being planned at the 
beginning of the Andropov era was in Greece, where a 
group of army colonels seized power in April 1967, 
suspended parliamentary government and declared martial 
law. The Greek Communist Party (KKE) was driven 
underground and its leaders temporarily lost touch with 
Moscow. In July 1967 the KGB was formally instructed 
by the CPSU Central Committee to renew contact with 
the underground Party (a task it had doubtless already 
begun) and to give it “political and material assistance.”^ 
The “material assistance” included both financial 
subsidies, usually handed over to Party representatives in 
Budapest,^ and help in preparing for guerrilla warfare. 
The Centre decreed that Department V’s main priority for 
1968 should be to set up sabotage and intelligence groups 
(DRGs) on Greek territory to prepare for an uprising 
against the military regime.^ Department V also made 



preparations for possible guerrilla operations in Italy. The 
leaders of the PCI were seriously afraid of an Italian 
military putsch on the Greek model and had requested 
Soviet assistance in preparing the Party for the possibility 
that, like the KKE, it would have to transform itself into 
an illegal underground movement.^ 

In 1968, all KGB residencies were sent operational 
letters headed “Recommendations for Creating the 
Necessary Conditions on the Territory of a Potential 
Adversary for Special Group [DRG] Operations in an 
Emergency.” The letter to the resident in Athens, Ivan 
Petrovich Kislyak (codenamed MAYSKY), added: “It is 
not possible that the course of events will in practice 
require us to assist local progressive forces in the near 
future, and we must therefore make preparations for this 
in advance.”^ The Centre issued instructions that all 
locally recruited DRGs operating in Greece were to be 
headed by KGB agents, but that this was to be concealed 
from other members of the groups. In 1968 the illegal 
PAUL was sent to Greece with orders to select “runways” 
(doroshki) for the landing of airborne Soviet DRGs and 
bases — “beehives” (ulya ) — from which to operate, as well 
as to check the suitability of those sites identified earlier. 
“Runway ALFA,” reconnoitered by PAUL, was located 
in the southern part of the Thessalia plain, about forty 
kilometers north-west of the town of Lamia. “Runway 
BETA” was on the north-west of the Thessalia plain, four 



or five kilometers south of the Kalambaka settlement. The 
wooded hilly districts of Belasitsa, Piri and Sengal were 
chosen as areas suitable for smuggling agents and 
equipment across the Bugarian — Greek border. 

In August 1968 the Bulgarian DS confidently informed 
the Centre that it was capable of overthrowing the Greek 
junta with the assistance of one of its agents, whom it 
identified as the former head of a Greek intelligence 
agency. The Bulgarian Central Committee had approved 
the proposed coup d'etat in Athens and instructed the 
leadership of its intelligence service to coordinate plans 
for it with the KGB and the CPSU Central Committee. 
The KGB files seen by Mitrokhin do not explain why the 
Bulgarian proposal was turned down. There were, 
however, at least three probable reasons. The Centre may 
well have assessed the risks of failure more highly than 
the Bulgarians. The Politburo, which at almost the 
moment the Bulgarian proposal reached it was deciding 
on the invasion of Czechoslovakia, was doubtless 
disinclined to give its simultaneous approval to a risky 
coup attempt in Greece. Further complications were 
caused by the split in the Greek Communist Party which, 
after the suppression of the Prague Spring, divided into 
the pro- Soviet KKE and the Eurocommunist KKE-es. 
Brillakis (codenamed SEMYON), who had hitherto been 
one of the KGB’s chief contacts in the underground 
Greek Party, refused further meetings with the Athens 
residency in protest at the Warsaw Pact invasion of 



Czechoslovakia. 

Though the KGB continued to channel large amounts 
of money into the KKE/^ it seems to have made little 
progress in setting up DRGs on Greek soil. The main 
material successfully smuggled across the Greek — 
Bulgarian border was not sabotage equipment into Greece 
but the archives of the KKE which were taken in the 
opposite direction. Weighing 14 tons, filling 1,598 
packages and four crates, guarded by thirty Greek 
Communists, they were transported from Bulgaria to 
Romania and thence to the Soviet Union, where they were 
deposited for safekeeping in the town of Ivanovo. 

AMONG DEPARTMENT V’S most ambitious proposals 
for special actions during 1968 was an operation to 
distract Western opinion from the suppression of the 
Prague Spring by sabotaging a major oil pipeline, 
codenamed ZVENO (“Link”), near the Austrian end of 
Bodensee Lake, which was believed by the Centre to 
carry 10 million tons of oil a year between Italy and West 
Germany. By breaching the pipeline at the point where it 
crossed the Rhine canal. Department V calculated that it 
could pollute the Bodensee, and thus contaminate the 
main source of drinking water on the West German — 
Austrian frontier. To carry the explosive, the Vienna 
residency purchased four Western-manufactured 1 -liter 
thermos flasks, as well as ten ballpoint pens — ^presumably 



to conceal the detonators. The scapegoats for the 
environmental disaster caused by the explosion were to be 
Italian extremists allegedly retaliating for acts of sabotage 
carried out by South Tyrol terrorists. 

ZVENO set the pattern for most Department V 
peacetime special actions: immensely laborious and 
detailed preparations, followed by a reluctant decision not 
to go ahead because of the political risks involved — in 
particular, the possibility that, despite all the precautions 
taken, the hand of the KGB might somehow be 
discovered. The operation was postponed several times, 
kept under review for a number of years and finally 
abandoned. 

Many, perhaps most, of the proposed special actions in 
Europe were intended to cause dissension within NATO. 
A characteristic example (reproduced at the end of this 
chapter) was the proposal by the Athens residency in 
April 1969 for a bomb attack on the Turkish consulate- 
general in Thessaloniki, which would be blamed on a 
Greek extremist. Though complimenting the Athens 
residency on its initiative, the Centre once again dared not 
take the risk of giving the go-ahead. Instead, on May 12, 
1969, it sent a temporizing reply: 

We approve the work carried out by the residency to 
collect material with the aim of preparing a Lily 
[sabotage operation] against the YAYTSO [Turkish 
consulate-general] target. We have put this target on 



file and if the need arises we shall return to the 
question of carrying out a Lily against it. 

We ask you to keep the YAYTSO target under 
observation as far as possible, in order to collect 
additional data and to take account of possible 
changes. 

Probably the first Department V plan approved by 
Sakharovsky, the head of the FCD, for a major special 
action in Britain was operation EDDING, a scheme to 
disrupt preparations for the investiture of the 20-year-old 
Prince Charles as Prince of Wales on July 1, 1969. 
Security at the ceremony itself in Caemavon Castle, when 
the Queen presented Prince Charles with the coronet, rod, 
ring, sword and mantle of his office in front of 4,000 
invited guests and a worldwide television audience of 500 
million, was expected to be too tight for a special action. 
Instead, about a month beforehand. Department V 
proposed to blow up a small bridge on the road from 
Porthmadog to Caemavon, near the junction of the A487 
and the A498, using British-manufactured gelignite. On 
the eve of the explosion a letter was to be sent to the 
Welsh Nationalist MP Gwynfor Evans, at the House of 
Commons, warning him that MI5 and Scotland Yard were 
planning a “provocation” in order to discredit the Welsh 
Nationalists and provide a pretext for a major security 
clampdown in Wales. 

When the explosion took place Evans and his colleagues 



were then expected to unmask the conspiracy by the 
“British organs of power” against Welsh liberties. Though 
backed by the FCD, however, operation EDDING was 
postponed by higher authority — either Andropov or the 
Politburo (the file does not specify which) — doubtless 
because of the fear, once again, that KGB involvement 
might come to light. 

A CENTRE REPORT in 1969 subjected the past record 
of both the Thirteenth Department and Department V to 
scathing criticism. Only the training of sabotage and 
intelligence groups (DRGs) was judged reasonably 
satisfactory. Some special tasks had proved beyond the 
capacity of both the Thirteenth Department and its 
successor to implement; others had become redundant. 
The report argued that there was little point in making 
elaborate preparations for DRGs to sabotage American 
and NATO military installations which were also targeted 
by the considerably more numerous GRU spetsnaz, and in 
many cases by the Soviet nuclear missile strike force. It 
was noted that, during the previous three years, there had 
been only one successful “special action of a political 
nature” — operation PEPEL (“Ashes”) in Istanbul 
(although what this was exactly remains unclear). The 
report, however, predictably failed to mention that the 
lack of special actions involving the peacetime use of 
sabotage and other forms of violence was due chiefly to 
Andropov’s refusal to sanction the proposals put to him. 



Andropov’s reluctance to accept the risks of the 
peacetime special actions for which he had called on 
becoming chairman forced him to rethink his strategy. 
Having reassessed the scope for direct involvement by the 
KGB, he increasingly turned to using terrorist proxies. 
Among the first opportunities for their use was a new 
wave of troubles in Northern Ireland. On November 6, 
1969 the general secretary of the Irish Communist Party, 
Michael O’Riordan, a veteran of the International 
Brigades,^^ forwarded a request for Soviet arms from the 
Marxist IRA leaders Cathal Goulding and Seamus 
Costello. According to O’Riordan: 

There has always existed more or less good relations 
between the IRA and the Irish Communists. We not 
only conduct a number of public and anti-imperialist 
activities together, but for more than a year a secret 
mechanism for consultations between the leadership 
of the IRA and the Joint Council of the Irish 
Workers’ Party and the Communist Party of 
Northern Ireland has existed and is operating. They 
unfailingly accept our advice with regard to tactical 
methods used in the joint struggle for civil rights and 
national independence for Ireland.^ ^ 

The IRA had been widely criticized by its supporters for 
failing to defend the Catholic community during the 
Belfast troubles of August 1969, when seven people had 



been killed, about 750 injured and 1,505 Catholic families 
had been forced out of their homes — almost five times the 
number of dispossessed Protestant households. One 
Catholic priest reported that his parishioners were 
contemptuously calling the IRA, “I Ran Away.”^^ In his 
message to Moscow, O’Riordan said that during the 
‘August crackdown” the IRA had failed to act as “armed 
defender” of the nationalist community because “its 
combat potential was weakened by the fact that it had 
previously concentrated its efforts on social protests and 
educational activity.” He claimed that there was now a 
real possibility of civil war in Northern Ireland between 
the two communities, and of serious clashes between 
British troops and the Catholics. Hence the IRA’s appeal 
for arms. In a report to the Central Committee, Andropov 
insisted that, before going ahead with an arms shipment, it 
was essential to verify O’Riordan’ s ability “to guarantee 
the necessary conspiracy in shipping the weapons and 
preserve the secret of their source of supply. It was 
more than two and half years before Andropov was 
sufficiently satisfied on both these points to go ahead with 
the arms shipment. 

While talks were continuing with O’Riordan, the illegal 
PAUL was instructed to explore the possibility of using 
extremist Quebec separatists in special actions against the 
United States. Given the violence of the terrorist 
methods employed by the FLQ {Front de Liberation du 



Quebec) and its apparent interest in Cuban and Soviet 
Bloc assistance, the hopes placed in it by the Centre were 
by no means fanciful. In 1969 the FLQ bombed both the 
home of the Montreal mayor and the National Defense 
Headquarters in Ottawa. During 1970 it failed in its 
attempts to kidnap the American and Israeli consuls- 
general in Montreal, but succeeded in kidnapping British 
trade official James Cross and Quebec labor minister 
Pierre Laporte. Cross was eventually released in return for 
a promise of safe conduct to Cuba for his kidnappers, but 
Laporte was murdered — strangled by the chain of the 
crucifix he wore around his neck.^^ 

Though PAUL probably succeeded in making at least 
indirect contact with the FLQ, the Centre almost certainly 
decided that the risks of establishing a direct KGB — FLQ 
connection were too great. The KGB did, however, seek 
to cover its own tracks by circulating forged documents 
indicating that the CIA was involved with the FLQ. On 
September 24, 1971 the Montreal Star published a 
photocopy of a bogus CIA memorandum dated October 
20, 1970: 

Subject Quebec. Sources advise that urgent action be 
taken to temporarily break contact with the FLQ 
militants since the Canadian govemmenf s measures 
may have undesirable consequences. 


Questions followed in the Canadian parliament. Prime 



Minister Pierre Trudeau declared that if the CIA was 
operating in Canada, it was “without the knowledge or 
consent of the govemment.”^^ Twenty years later the 
forged memorandum was still being quoted in Canadian 
publications, even by some academic authorities.^^ 
Further forgeries suggesting CIA involvement with 
Quebec extremists were circulated on the eve of the visit 
to Canada by President Nixon in 1972.^^ 

ANDROPOV’S FRUSTRATION AT the difficulty of 
mounting peacetime special tasks which would leave no 
trace of the KGB’s involvement was heightened by his 
mistaken conviction that the CIA was pursuing its own 
series of special tasks against KGB officers and other 
Soviet citizens living abroad. In a letter to Brezhnev of 
May 21, 1970, headed “of special importance,” Andropov 
gave three instances of actual or attempted “abductions” 
by the CIA: the unsuccessful attempt to abduct the KGB 
officer Georgi Petrovich Pokrovsky in Tokyo on March 
17, 1966; similarly, Yuri Sergeevich Pivovarov of the 
GRU in Buenos Aires on March 29, 1970; and the 
disappearance without trace of a Novosti correspondent in 
Delhi, Yuri Aleksandrovich Bezmenov, on March 9, 
\910P 

Andropov’s allegations derived not from any real CIA 
program of covert action but from his own addiction to 
conspiracy theory. Pivovarov had been the victim of an 



attempted kidnap and assassination by the right-wing 
Argentinian terrorist group Mano (“Hand”), which 
claimed to be avenging the kidnapping of a Paraguayan 
diplomat by left-wing terrorists. Most other cases of 
alleged CIA special actions against KGB officers were in 
reality cases of actual or attempted defection. Some FCD 
officers realized — as Andropov did not — that 
“abductions” were convenient fictions used by residencies 
to conceal the shameful reality of defection. Such was the 
case, for example, in the disappearance of Bezmenov. 
Anxious to save face, the Delhi residency had reported 
that he had been abducted, and his son (the closest 
surviving relative) was given financial compensation.^^ In 
reality, as Bezmenov later admitted: 

I decided to stay in India to become a kind of hippie 
and get to now the country. Unfortunately, I started 
reading local newspaper and found out the Indian 
police were looking for me. I panicked. I tried to 
make a deal with smugglers to take me out of the 
country, but they either wanted too much money or 
didn’t trust me. 

Eventually Bezmenov approached the CIA, who 
exfiltrated him first to Greece, where he was debriefed, 
then resettled him in Canada.^^ The KGB abandoned the 
myth of Bezmenov’ s abduction after he was seen visiting 
an exhibition in Montreal in 1974, and ordered his 



bewildered son to return all the money they had paid to 
him.^^ 

The conspiracy theorists in the Centre, however, 
remained convinced that the CIA was out to abduct KGB 
officers, as well as to induce them “to commit treason” (in 
other words, to defect). That belief survived until the end 
of the Cold War. When Kryuchkov became the first head 
of the FCD to visit Washington in 1987, Robert Gates, 
then deputy DCI, found it impossible to persuade him that 
a Soviet scientist, Vladimir Valentinovich Aleksandrov, 
who had gone missing in Spain, had not been physically 
abducted by the CIA.^^ 

In his letter to Brezhnev of May 21, 1970, Andropov 
insisted that the CIA dared to engage in “brazen” 
provocations towards the KGB only because of “the lack 
of appropriate measures on our part.” It was, he argued, 
high time to retaliate in kind and abduct a CIA officer to 
teach the Americans a lesson. To avoid the risk that a 
KGB special action might go wrong and become publicly 
known, Andropov asked Brezhnev’s permission to use a 
proxy. 

The precedent set by the previous use of Sandinista 
guerrillas against American targets in central and north 
America. encouraged both Andropov and Department V 
to consider the use of Palestinian terrorists as proxies in 
the Middle East and Europe. The man chiefly responsible 
for exporting Palestinian terrorism to Europe was Dr 



Wadi Haddad, deputy leader of the Marxist-Leninist 
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), 
headed by Dr George Habash. In 1968-9 Haddad had 
attracted favorable attention in the Centre with a spate of 
aircraft hijackings and attacks on Israeli offices and 
Jewish businesses in European capitals. In 1970 he was 
recruited by the KGB as agent NATSIONALIST. 
Andropov reported to Brezhnev: 

The nature of our relations with W. Haddad enables 
us to control the external operations of the PFLP to a 
certain degree, to exert influence in a manner 
favorable to the Soviet Union and also to carry out 
active measures in support of our interests through 
the organization’s assets while observing the 
necessary conspiratorial secrecy.^^ 

Andropov sought Brezhnev’s approval to use Haddad for 
a special action against the CIA: 

It appears expedient to carry out an operation to 
abduct the deputy CIA resident in Lebanon . . . and 
to have him taken to the Soviet Union both as a 
retaliatory measure and with the aim of possibly 
obtaining reliable information [from him] about the 
plans and specific operations of the USA in the 
Middle East. It is planned to carry out the operation 
through a reliable agent of the Beirut residency. 



NATSIONALIST [Haddad], who directs the 
sabotage operations of the Popular Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine and is experienced in carrying 
out aggressive measures. 

The essence of the operational plan is that [the 
CIA officer] would be abducted by 
NATSIONALIST ’s reliable fighters in Beirut or its 
surroundings and would be delivered illicitly to a 
place which we selected in the Damascus region, 
where he would be handed over to our operational 
officers. From Damascus, he would be taken 
illegally to the USSR on one of our special aircraft or 
on board ship. 

Bearing in mind that the Palestinian guerrilla 
organizations have recently stepped up their 
activities in Lebanon against American intelligence 
and its agents, the Lebanese authorities and the 
Americans would suspect Palestinian guerrillas of 
carrying out the above operation. The ultimate 
purpose of the operation would be known only to 
NATSIONALIST, on the foreign side, and to the 
KGB officers directly involved in planning the 
operation and carrying it out, on the Soviet side. 

I request your authority to prepare and carry out 
the above operation. 

Brezhnev gave his consent on May 25, 1970. The Beirut 
residency then passed on to Haddad a detailed dossier on 



the CIA officer (codenamed VIR), his home address (a 
fourth- floor apartment), car (a light blue Ford Comet with 
diplomatic numberplates), route to and from work at the 
US embassy and personal habits. It was noted, for 
example, that VIR regularly went for walks accompanied 
by his black poodle. 

Haddad agreed to select three of the “most experienced 
and reliable” gunmen to kidnap VIR. As soon as he had 
been seized, his captors would press over his mouth and 
nose a mask impregnated with a general anaesthetic 
supplied by Department V. While VIR was unconscious, 
he would be given an injection (also provided by the 
KGB) which would leave him disoriented and unable to 
resist when he recovered consciousness. The PFLP would 
then drive VIR, dressed in fedayeen clothes, into Syria 
along a route carefully reconnoitered by the KGB and 
hand him over to Line F officers from the Damascus 
residency in a hamlet near Zabadani. From there he was to 
be exfiltrated by the KGB to the Soviet Union.^^ 

One of Haddad’s probable reasons for agreeing to work 
as a Soviet agent was to obtain arms for the PFLP. In July 
1970 Brezhnev agreed to an initial request from 
Andropov that Haddad be supplied from the KGB arsenal 
with five RPG-7 handheld anti-tank grenade launchers for 
terrorist operations. The head of Department V, Nikolai 
Pavlovich Gusev, and his assistant, Aleksei Nikolayevich 
Savin, then met Haddad to discuss the handover of further 
arms supplies which it was agreed to deliver under cover 



to darkness in an inflatable rubber boat at a pre-arranged 
spot near Aden. Control of the operation, codenamed 
VOSTOK (“East”), was entrusted to the deputy head 
(later head) of Department V, Aleksandr Ivanovich 
Lazarenko. On the orders of the defense minister. Marshal 
Ustinov, the arms for Haddad were loaded on an 
intelligence-gathering vessel of the Pacific Fleet, the 
Kursograf, at Vladivostok. With S. M. Grankin from 
Department V on board to supervise the handover, the 
Kursograf then set sail for the gulf of Aden to rendezvous 
with Haddad’s motor launch at a point 12°34' north and 
45° 12' east, at 2100 hours local time. As arranged, 
Haddad signaled his presence with a 360-degree red 
signal light. The Kursograf extinguished its lights, locked 
on to the launch’s radio beacon and signaled its presence 
with two brief flashes, repeated after a short interval. On 
receiving the answering signal (four brief flashes) from 
Haddad, the Kursograf launched the rubber boat 
containing the arms supplies and gave the agreed signal 
“Load launched” (three brief flashes) twice. Haddad’s 
launch gave the same signal in reply, then made a “dot- 
dash” signal twice as soon as it had picked up the arms. 

The arms supplied to Haddad consisted of 50 West 
German pistols (10 with silencers) and 5,000 rounds of 
ammunition; 50 captured MG-ZI machine guns with 
10,000 rounds of ammunition; 5 British-made Sterling 
automatics with silencers and 36,000 rounds of 
ammunition; 50 American AR-16 automatics with 30,000 



rounds of ammunition; 15 booby-trap mines 
manufactured from foreign materials; and 5 radio- 
controlled SNOP mines, also assembled from foreign 
materials. The two varieties of mine were considered 
some of the most sophisticated small weapons in the 
Soviet arsenal, and, like some of the silencers given to 
Haddad, had never previously been supplied even to other 
members of the Warsaw Pact. The SNOP mines could be 
detonated by radio signal at distances of up to two 
kilometers in cities and fifteen to twenty kilometers in the 
countryside. 

The successful completion of operation VOSTOK was 
greeted in the Centre as a major triumph. On the 
recommendation of the FCD, and with the approval of 
Rear Admiral Radchenko, head of the KGB Special 
Department in the Pacific Fleet, VOSTOK souvenirs 
(each valued at 600 roubles) and cash bonuses of 600 
roubles were awarded to seven of the naval commanders 
who had taken part: Captain V. P. Lebedev, commander 
of the Kursograf; Captains (First Rank) A. G. Shtyrov 
and E. P. Lopatin; Captains (Second Rank) G. S. Babkov 
and V. 1. Avramenko; and Lieutenant Commanders A. V. 
Gamitsky and A. S. Klimchuk. The Centre also sent a 
formal letter of thanks to the Chief of Naval Staff, 
Admiral of the Fleet N. D. Sergeyev. 

The Centre was to make what it considered successful 
use of Haddad and the PFLP in a number of special 
actions in the Middle East, particularly against Israel 



(which will be covered in the next volume of this book). 
But operation VINT, the attempt by the PFLP to abduct 
the deputy head of the CIA station in Beirut, ended in 
failure. VIR varied his daily routine and Haddad’s 
gunmen found it impossible to implement the original 
plan for his abduction. During 1971 Department V 
devised a number of alternative plans to kidnap VIR. One 
simply proposed that Haddad arrange VIR’s 
assassination. All failed. So did operation INTIKAM, an 
attempt to use PFLP terrorists to kill two Soviet defectors, 
P. S. Branzinkas and his son (codenamed PIRATY, 
“Pirates”), who in 1970 hijacked an Aeroflot aircraft and 
escaped to Turkey. The operational file records that 
NATSIONALIST did not realize how difficult the 
assignment would be, and overestimated his 
capabilities.”^^ 

Plans to make larger use of the PFLP to hunt down 
Soviet defectors were largely abandoned. Andropov’s 
decision to use Haddad for special actions, and 
Brezhnev’s approval for it, none the less marked a turning 
point in the history of KGB operations. Henceforth, other 
Soviet Bloc intelligence services were to follow the 
Soviet lead in using, or conniving in the use of, terrorist 
groups. 

LIKE THE OPERATIONS of the Thirteenth Department 
during the Khrushchev era, those of Department V were 
seriously compromised by defections. The most important 



defector was the Line F officer in the London residency, 
Oleg Adolfovich Lyalin, an expert in hand-to-hand 
combat as well as a highly proficient marksman and 
parachutist who had been recruited by MI5 as a defector- 
in-place in the spring of 1971. During the six months 
before he defected in September, Lyalin provided details 
of KGB sabotage plans in London, Washington, Paris, 
Bonn, Rome and other Western capitals. In addition to 
compromising preparations for a number of peacetime 
special actions, he revealed Department V’s hair-raising 
contingency plans for operations during periods of 
international crisis or conflict which would be carried out 
by illegals, local agents and sabotage and intelligence 
groups (DRGs) who would infiltrate each target 
country.^^ 

In Washington, according to Oleg Kalugin, head of 
Line PR and deputy resident. Line F “did everything from 
plotting ways to poison the capital’s water systems to 
drawing up assassination plans for US leaders. 
Projected sabotage in Britain included plans to flood the 
London Underground, blow up the early-warning station 
at Fylingdale, North Yorkshire, and destroy V-bombers 
on the ground. Some of Department V’s schemes were as 
bizarre as any of those devised by the CIA in its 
unsuccessful attempts to kill Castro a decade earlier. One 
plan revealed by Lyalin was for KGB agents posing as 
messengers and delivery men to scatter colorless poison 
capsules along Whitehall corridors of power which would 



kill all those who crushed them underfoot. Though the 
British government released few details about Lyalin after 
his defection, the Attorney General told the Commons 
that he was charged with “the organization of sabotage 
within the United Kingdom” and “the elimination of 
individuals judged to be enemies of the USSR.” 

The Centre was caught completely off-guard by 
Lyalin’s defection and the almost simultaneous action 
against the London residency taken by the British 
government. On September 24, 1971 the Permanent 
Under- Secretary at the Foreign and Commonwealth 
Office, Sir Denis Greenhill, summoned the Soviet charge 
d’ affairs, Ivan Ivanovich Ippolitov (a KGB agent), and 
informed him that 90 KGB and GRU officers stationed in 
Britain under official cover were to be expelled and 
another fifteen, then on leave in the Soviet Union, would 
not be allowed to return, making a grand total of 105 
expulsions. Many of the Soviet intelligence officers 
concerned had been known to MI5 and SIS for some time, 
but over the past six months Lyalin had confirmed a 
number of probable identifications and added new names 
to the list.^^ Preparations for operation FOOT, as the mass 
expulsion was codenamed in Whitehall, had been under 
secret discussion throughout that time. In a joint memo to 
the Prime Minister, Edward Heath, on July 30, the 
Foreign and Home Secretaries, Sir Alec Douglas Home 
and Reginald Maudling, argued that the sheer numbers of 
KGB and GRU officers in London were “more than the 



Security Service can be expected to contain. The 
horrendous nature of some of the Department V sabotage 
plans revealed by Lyalin added weight to the arguments 
for expulsion. 

Almost immediately after Ippolitov’s return from the 
FCO on Friday September 24, the MI5 surveillance team 
near the Soviet embassy in Kensington Palace Gardens 
reported that a KGB officer had been seen sprinting 
across the road from the residency opposite, no doubt 
summoned by telephone for an urgent briefing on the 
mass expulsion.^^ In the short term Lyalin’s defection 
probably caused even greater concern than operation 
FOOT. Over the weekend the Centre informed the Soviet 
leadership that Lyalin was likely to compromise 
Department V operations in other countries. On Monday 
September 27 Brezhnev cut short a tour of eastern Europe 
for an emergency meeting of the Politburo in the VIP 
lounge at Moscow airport. Shortly afterwards most Line F 
officers were recalled from Western capitals, leaving 
Department V effectively crippled and unable to fulfill its 
task of coordinating sabotage operations abroad in time of 
crisis. The Centre investigation into the London 
debecle, which, as was traditional, emphasized the alleged 
personal depravity of the defector, claimed that Lyalin 
had seduced the wives of a number of his Soviet 
colleagues in London, and heavily criticized the former 
resident, Yuri Nikolayevich Voronin, for covering up 



Lyalin’s misdeeds to avoid a scandal The head of the 
FCD Third Department, whose responsibilities included 
operations in Britain, was among those senior KGB 
officers who were demoted or sacked as a result.^^ 

JUST AS STASHINSKY’S defection in 1961 had made 
the Centre much more cautious in ordering assassinations, 
so Lyalin’s defection a decade later dealt a further blow to 
its plans for peacetime sabotage. Department V found 
itself in limbo pending a reorganization which took three 
and a half years to complete. The files seen by Mitrokhin 
record no new schemes for KGB “special political 
actions” during the few years immediately after Lyalin’s 
“treachery.” (It is, of course, possible that some special 
actions are recorded in files not seen by Mitrokhin.) One 
example of the Centre’s declining enthusiasm for such 
operations which made a particular impression on 
Mitrokhin was its response to the defection of another star 
of the Kirov Ballet, Mikhail Baryshnikov, while on a tour 
of Canada in June 1974. Baryshnikov’s flawless classical 
style and apparently effortless grace had made him one of 
Mitrokhin’ s personal favorites. Among the intercepted 
messages sent to Baryshnikov after his defection which 
found their way into his KGB file, Mitrokhin noted one 
from a female balletomane in Leningrad which told him 
that he “was, is and forever will be my dear little brother . 
. . one of the brightest, most beautiful and most notable 
people I have ever met.” Unsurprisingly, the KGB kept 



Baryshnikov under close observation after his defection. 
Its agents included another ballet dancer, codenamed 
MORIS, who also reported on Nureyev and Makarova. 
What struck Mitrokhin, however, was the apparent lack of 
plans to maim Baryshnikov similar to those which had 
been devised, though not apparently implemented, against 
Nureyev and Makarova a few years earlier.^^ 

Despite the KGB’s increased reluctance to take the 
risks involved in implementing directly special actions in 
the West, it continued to use — or connive at the use of — 
terrorist groups as proxies in the struggle against the 
United States and its allies. The Centre’s mood, however, 
remained distinctly cautious. It was almost three years 
before the arms requested by the IRA in November 1969 
through the intermediary of the Irish Communist leader, 
Michael O’Riordan, were finally delivered by the KGB. 
Shortly after the request had been made, the IRA had split 
into two: the Officials under Cathal Goulding and the 
Provisionals led by Sean MacStioftin.^^ The sympathies 
of the KGB were wholly with the Marxist Officials rather 
than the more nationalist Provisionals. Though 
Goulding ’s long-term aim was to create a nonsectarian, 
non-military, all-Ireland revolutionary movement, the 
Officials were responsible for some of the bloodiest 
episodes in the Troubles of the early 1970s. The only 
answer to the “forces of imperialism and exploitation,” 
Goulding declared in 1971, lay “in the language that 
brings these vultures to their senses most effectively, the 



language of the bomb and the bullet.” The Official IRA’s 
bloodthirsty attempts to upstage the Provisionals ended by 
alienating some of its own supporters. In February 1972 a 
bomb planted at the Aldershot headquarters of the 
Parachute Regiment killed seven people, including a 
Catholic priest and five women canteen workers. 
Nationalist anger at the killing of an off-duty British 
soldier on home leave in Derry on May 21 led the 
Officials’ army council to announce a ceasefire eight days 
later. Since the Officials reserved the right to take what 
they described as “defensive action,” however, the 
ceasefire had little immediate effect. Though Goulding 
gradually succeeded in scaling down “military 
operations,” local militants continued terrorist attacks 
during the remainder of 1972 and 1973.^^ 

On July 3, 1972 the Irish Communist leader, Michael 
O’Riordan, wrote to remind the CPSU Central Committee 
that the arms he had first requested on behalf of the IRA 
in November 1969 had still not been received. Since then, 
on behalf of the Official IRA, he had held numerous 
discussions on the means of shipment with the KGB’s 
“technical specialists:” “The fact that there has not been 
the slightest leak of information for two and a half years 
proves, in my opinion, a high level of responsibility with 
regard to keeping the secret, so to speak.” Andropov 
agreed. On August 21 he presented to the Central 
Committee a “Plan for the Operation of a Shipment of 
Weapons to the Irish Friends,” codenamed SPLASH. 



SPLASH was a variant of operation VOSTOK, which had 
delivered arms to Haddad and the PFLP two years earlier. 
Once again, the weapons and munitions — 2 machine- 
guns, 70 automatic rifles, 10 Walther pistols, 41,600 
cartridges, all of non- Soviet origin to disguise the 
involvement of the KGB — were transported by a Soviet 
intelligence-gathering vessel, on this occasion the 
Reduktor. On this occasion, the arms, in waterproof 
wrapping, were submerged to a depth of about 40 meters 
on the Stanton sandbank, 90 kilometers from the coast of 
Northern Ireland, and attached to a marker buoy of the 
kind used to indicate the presence of fishing nets below 
the surface. KGB laboratories carefully examined the 
arms shipment before it left to ensure that there was no 
trace of Soviet involvement. The Walther pistols were 
lubricated with West German oil, the packaging was 
purchased abroad by KGB residencies and it was 
specified that the marker buoy should be Finnish or 
Japanese. A few hours after the arms had been deposited 
on the sandbank, they were retrieved by a fishing vessel 
belonging to the “Irish friends,” whose crew were 
unaware of their contents. Operation SPLASH was 
supervised on board the Reduktor by an officer from the 
8th Department of Directorate S (the successor to 
Department V). Several further Soviet arms shipments to 
the Official IRA were delivered by similar methods. 

The KGB can have had few illusions about the likely 
use of the arms it supplied, since the man in charge of 



their collection from the sandbank was the Officials’ most 
hard-line terrorist, Seamus Costello. Late in 1974, after 
a dispute with Goulding, Costello was expelled from the 
Officials and founded a new Trotsky ite movement, the 
Irish Republican Socialist Party (IRSP). The Officials set 
up four assassination squads to liquidate the dissidents, 
but came off worse in a series of shoot-outs in the spring 
of 1975. They had, however, rather the better of a feud 
later in the year with the Provisionals. The Official IRA 
eventually succeeded in murdering Costello in 1977.^^ 
The probability is that some of the arms smuggled into 
Ireland by the KGB were used in the internecine warfare 
between republican paramilitaries. 

As well as shipping arms to the Official IRA, the KGB 
also continued to use some Third World terrorists and 
guerrillas — notably the PFLP and the Sandinistas — as 
proxies. In Latin America, the KGB found itself — 
somewhat to its irritation — ^being upstaged by its Cuban 
ally, the DGI. By 1970, in the Centre’s view, the DGI had 
effectively “expropriated” the Sandinista ISKRA guerrilla 
group. In 1969 the DGI financed the guerrilla operation to 
free the FSLN (Sandinista) leader, Carlos Fonseca 
Amador (GIDROLOG), from a Costa Rican jail, where he 
had been imprisoned for bank robbery. Fonseca was 
recaptured shortly after his jailbreak, but freed again and 
flown to Cuba after the Sandinista hijack of a plane 
carrying American executives of the United Fruit 



Company, who were released in exchange. The DGI 
also organized guerrilla training for the Sandinistas in 
Cuba, and gave them 100,000 dollars to purchase 
weapons. The head of the DGI, Manuel Pineiro Losado, 
whose nickname “Redbeard” reflected his fiery 
temperament, told the deputy head of the FCD, Boris 
Semenovich Ivanov, 

Of all the countries in Latin America, the most active 
work being carried out by us is in Nicaragua. Aid is 
being given to partisan groups headed by C[arlos] 
Fonseca. This movement has influence and could go 
far. 

At a meeting with Fonseca in February 1971, Pineiro 
restated the conviction of the Cuban leadership that for 
most Latin American countries armed conflict was the 
only path to liberation. Though Cuba remained willing to 
offer the Sandinistas “any kind of support and assistance,” 
they would need to make major changes in their 
organization if they were to avoid the defeats and heavy 
losses they had suffered during the past decade. The 
Centre concluded that future attempts to use the 
Sandinistas for special actions against United States 
targets would have to be made in collaboration with the 
DGI.5» 

The KGB did, however, retain a number of agents 
within the Sandinistas, among them GRIN (not identified 



by Mitrokhin’s notes), who was used to identify possible 
operations in which the KGB could make use of the 
FSLN. In May 1974 a Sandinista delegation visited the 
Soviet embassy in Havana and delivered a letter to the 
CPSU Central Committee asking for assistance. The most 
dramatic Sandinista attack on a United States target was 
the attempt, assisted by the DGI with the personal 
blessing of Fidel Castro, to kidnap Turner B. Shelton, the 
American ambassador in Managua and a close friend of 
the Somoza family. Remarkably, Shelton and President 
Anastasio Somoza Debayle appeared together on the 1974 
twenty cordoba note, the ambassador’s head inclined 
deferentially towards the president; the note quickly 
became known as the sapo (“toady”). The original plan 
of attack appears to have been for a guerrilla group to 
force an entry into the US embassy during a diplomatic 
reception.^^ On December 27, 1974, however, an 
unexpected opportunity arose during a party in honor of 
Shelton given by the former minister of agriculture, Jose 
Maria (Chema) Castillo. A Sandinista working 
undercover as a waiter at the reception telephoned the 
guerrilla group to report that Castillo’s house was poorly 
guarded, providing an excellent opportunity to kidnap the 
ambassador. 

Shelton escaped kidnap by the skin of his teeth. He left 
the reception minutes before a well-drilled assault group 
of Sandinistas (ten male, three female) stormed Castillo’s 



mansion at 10:50 p.m. Finding the ambassador gone, they 
killed his host, held the rest of the guests hostage and 
demanded that the Archbishop of Managua act as 
mediator. After several days of tense negotiations. 
President Somoza released eighteen imprisoned FSLN 
members, paid a million-dollar ransom for the release of 
the hostages, agreed to publish a 12,000-word 
denunciation of himself and US imperialism and provided 
a plane to fly the Sandinistas to Cuba.^^ On the 
Sandinistas’ arrival at Havana, the Cubans took 
possession of the million dollars. 

Though the FSLN had won an enormous propaganda 
victory, the period of brutal martial law which followed in 
Nicaragua led to the death of many of its guerrillas and 
internal conflict among the Sandinistas over how to wage 
a victorious guerrilla war.^^ Still in awe of the Russian 
revolutionary tradition,^^ Fonseca turned to Moscow for 
advice. On February 14, 1975 he asked the Soviet 
embassy in Havana to arrange a trip to Moscow for 
himself and other Sandinistas so that they could study and 
learn from both Bolshevik experience before the October 
Revolution and methods of partisan warfare during the 
Great Patriotic War. He also requested further financial 
assistance. Late in 1975, probably soon after his return 
from Moscow,^^ Fonseca traveled secretly to Nicaragua 
to try to resolve the factional conflict within the FLSN. 
On November 8, 1976 he was killed in a shoot-out with a 



National Guard patrol. After the Sandinista victory in 
1979, Fonseca was reburied as a Hero of the 
Revolution. 

IN FEBRUARY 1976 the Politburo approved increase 
staffing and funding for the FCD Illegals Directorate S. 
As part of the reorganization of the enlarged Directorate 
by KGB order no. 0046 of April 12, 1976, the former 
Department V was formally incorporated into it as 
Department 8 with, by 1980, 23 operational officers at 
headquarters out of the total for the directorate of 400.^^ 
The head of Department 8, Vladimir Grigory evich 
Krasovsky, mournfully reflected on the decline of KGB 
special actions in recent years. His self-image as a man of 
action was symbolized by the cigarette lighter mounted on 
a fragmentation hand grenade which he kept on his desk. 
But, he complained, “We move paper from place to place. 
That’s all we do!.^^ Department 8’s most basic task — the 
liquidation of traitors who had fled abroad — was by now 
an almost hopeless one. But the Centre could not bring 
itself either to give up the ritual of passing death 
sentences on KGB defectors or to abandon the pretence 
that the sentences would one day be carried out. 

According to Oleg Kalugin, head of FCD Directorate K 
(counterintelligence) from 1973 to 1979, the KGB 
succeeded in tracking down only two post-war defectors, 
one in Australia (probably Vladimir Petrov) and the other 



in the United States (probably Pyotr Deryabin) — ^both of 
whom had defected in the 1950s. “The hell with them — 
they’re old men now!” Andropov told Kalugin. “. . . Find 
Oleg Lyalin or Yuri Nosenko, and I will sanction the 
execution of those two!”^^ Probably in 1974, Nikolai 
Fyodorovich Artamonov (codenamed LARK), a former 
Soviet naval officer working as an analyst in the US 
Office of Naval Intelligence under the alias “Nicholas 
Shadrin,” told his KGB controller that he could discover 
the whereabouts of Nosenko who, he claimed, was living 
near Washington. In 1975 a KGB agent among the 
Russian Orthodox clergy in the United States found a 
gangster willing to take out a contract on Nosenko for 
100,000 dollars. But before he could do so, the gangster 
was arrested for other crimes. Almost simultaneously, 
Artamonov was discovered to be a double agent working 
for the FBI. In December 1975, after being lured to 
Austria, ostensibly to meet a new controller, he was 
bundled into a car by operations officers from the Vienna 
residency who intended to exfiltrate him to Moscow for 
questioning. The sedative injected into Artamonov to stop 
him struggling in the back seat was so powerful that it 
killed him. Kryuchkov, however, was delighted that at 
last a traitor had received his just deserts. “Which medal 
do you want?” he asked Kalugin. “The October 
Revolution or the Combat Red Banner?” Kalugin chose 
the Red Banner.^^ 



From 1976 to 1981 the Line KR (counterintelligence) 
officer E. R. Ponomarev (codenamed KEDROV) was 
stationed at the Washington residency with the sole task 
of tracking down defectors and was given the cover post 
of deputy head of the Consular Department in order to 
give him a pretext for making enquiries in the 
Departments of Immigration and Naturalization, as well 
as in lawyers’ offices. Ponomarev also gained access to 
the file of purchasers at a Russian-language bookshop and 
cultivated academics thought likely to come into contact 
with defectors.^^ His five years in Washington appear to 
have been an expensive waste of time and effort. 

Some of the KGB’s Soviet Bloc allies, in particular the 
Bulgarian Durzhavna Sigumost (DS), were much less 
cautious than the Centre in their pursuit of defectors. The 
zeal with which the DS hunted down traitors who had fled 
abroad owed much to the personal outrage with which the 
Bulgarian dictator, Todor Zhivkov, the most colorful and 
grotesque of the rulers of eastern Europe, responded to 
emigre criticism and mockery. The best known of the 
emigre writers, Georgi Markov, broadcast regular 
commentaries on the corruption and excesses of the 
Zhivkov regime in the Bulgarian-language services of the 
BBC World Service and Radio Free Europe, ridiculing 
Zhivkov himself as a man with a “a distastefully mediocre 
sense of humor,” the bullying manner of “a village 
policeman,” a penchant for “pompous phrases” and the 
deluded conviction that he was a great huntsman. 



In 1974 Boris Arsov, another of the defectors who had 
dared to attack the excesses of the Zhivkov regime, 
suddenly disappeared from his flat in Aarhus, Denmark, 
where he had been publishing the Bulgarian emigre 
newspaper Lev ski. Two months later he resurfaced in 
Sofia and was sentenced to fifteen years’ imprisonment. 
An official statement during Arsov’ s trial virtually 
admitted that he had been kidnapped by the DS: 

Arsov was playing with fire. The timely activity of 
the State Security stopped his dangerous activity. 

This only shows that the hand of justice is longer 
than the legs of the traitor. 

In 1975 Arsov was officially declared to have been found 
dead in his prison cell. At about the same time three 
Bulgarian exiles who had been helping others to defect — 
Ivan Kolev, Peter Nezamov and Vesselina Stoyova — 
were shot in Vienna. The assassin, quickly identified by 
the Austrian police, was a DS agent who had penetrated 
the emigre group and escaped to Sofia after the 
murders. 

The KGB eventually became embroiled in DS special 
political actions. Early in 1978 General Dimitar Stoyanov, 
Bulgarian interior minister and head of the DS, appealed 
to the Centre for help in liquidating Georgi Markov, then 
living in London and accused of “slandering Comrade 
Zhivkov” in his many radio broadcasts. The request was 



considered at a meeting chaired by Andropov and 
attended by Kryuchkov, Vice Admiral Mikhail Usatov 
(Kryuchkov’s deputy) and Oleg Kalugin, head of FCD 
counterintelligence. Though reluctant to take the risks 
involved in helping the Bulgarians, Andropov eventually 
accepted Kryuchkov’s argument that to refuse would be 
an unacceptable slight to Zhivkov. “But,” he insisted, 
“there is to be no direct participation on our part. Give the 
Bulgarians whatever they need, show them how to use it 
and send someone to Sofia to train their people. But that’s 
all.” 

The Centre made available to the DS the resources of 
its top secret poisons laboratory, the successor to the 
Kamera of the Stalinist era, attached to the OTU 
(Operational Technical) Directorate and under the direct 
control of the KGB chairman. Sergei Mikhailovich 
Golubev, head of FCD security and a poisons specialist, 
was put in charge of liaison with the Bulgarians. The 
murder weapon eventually chosen was concealed in an 
American umbrella, one of a number purchased at 
Golubev’s request by the Washington residency in order 
to disguise the KGB connection if the weapon was ever 
discovered. The tip was converted by OTU technicians 
into a silenced gun capable of firing a tiny pellet 
containing a lethal dose of ricin, a highly toxic poison 
made from castor-oil seeds. On September 7, 1978, while 
Markov was waiting at a bus stop on Waterloo Bridge, he 
felt a sudden sting in his right thigh. Turning instinctively. 



he saw a man behind him who had dropped his umbrella. 
The stranger apologized, picked up his umbrella and got 
into a taxi waiting nearby. Though Markov felt no 
immediate ill effects, he became seriously ill next day and 
died in hospital on September 11. During the autopsy a 
tiny pellet was recovered from Markov’s thigh, but the 
ricin, as Golubev had calculated, had decomposed. 
Markov’s assassination alerted another Bulgarian emigre, 
Vladimir Kostov, to the significance of an earlier, 
unexplained attack he had been subject to in Paris on 
August 26. Nearly a month later, on September 25, a steel 
pellet of the kind that had killed Markov was removed, 
still intact, from Rostov’s back. During a visit to Sofia 
soon afterwards, Kalugin was presented by General 
Stoyanov with an expensive Browning hunting rifle in 
gratitude for KGB assistance in the murder of Markov.^^ 

THE CHIEF ADDITION to Soviet special tasks 
capability during the later Cold War was the creation of 
KGB special forces (spetsnaz) with the foundation of the 
Alpha group in 1974, on Andropov’s personal 
instructions.^^ Intended for foreign operations and 
initially kept secret from all but a minority of FCD 
officers, the special forces grew steadily in numbers 
during the late 1970s. Their first major operation, by far 
the most important special action of the Andropov era, 
was the murder of President Hafizullah Amin of 
Afghanistan, who seized power in a blood-thirsty palace 



coup in September 1979.^^ Cautious though Andropov 
had become in ordering assassinations, he convinced 
himself that in this case he had no option. Amin, he 
believed, was contemplating ending the Communist 
regime in Afghanistan and turning to the West. There 
were even reports, which Andropov appears to have taken 
seriously, that Amin was plotting with the CIA.^^ As 
during the Czechoslovak crisis in 1968,^^ Andropov took 
the lead in insisting on the enforcement of the “Brezhnev 
doctrine” which asserted Moscow’s right to prevent the 
defection of any member of the Soviet Bloc. 

For the first time since its foundation. Department 8 of 
FCD Directorate S (Illegals) moved into the front line of 
KGB operations. Its plot to assassinate Amin, operation 
AG AT (“Agate”), formed part of a larger invasion plan.^^ 
By late November, after Amin had demanded the 
replacement of A. M. Puzanov, the Soviet ambassador, 
Andropov and defence minister Ustinov, the two leading 
hawks in the Politburo, were agreed on the need for 
Soviet military intervention as well as the elimination of 
Amin.^^ Early in December, Andropov sent Brezhnev a 
handwritten letter, reporting “alarming information 
[intelligence] about Amin’s secret activities, forewarning 
of a possible shift to the West,” bringing with it both the 
end of Communist rule and a catastrophic loss of Soviet 
influence. On December 8 Andropov and Ustinov 
jointly obtained Brezhnev’s approval for a draft invasion 



plan.^^ 

While Marshal Akhromeyev and the General Staff 
operations group in charge of the invasion established 
their headquarters near the Afghan border in Uzbekistan, 
the head of Directorate S, Vadim Vasilyevich 
Kirpichenko, and the head of Department 8, Vladimir 
Krasovsky, flew secretly into Kabul to supervise the 
overthrow of Amin. Dayto-day control of operation 
AG AT was entrusted to Krasovsky’s deputy, A. 1. 
Lazarenko. A team from the KGB Seventh (Surveillance) 
Directorate flew in to monitor Amin’s movements. 
Meanwhile, elaborate attempts were made to avoid 
arousing Amin’s suspicions. His requests for military 
supplies were granted and two radio stations were 
constructed for him. On December 23, however, the KGB 
residency in Kabul reported that Amin’s suspicions had 
been aroused both by Western radio reports of Soviet 
troop movements and the frequent flights into the Soviet 
airbase at Bagram, outside Kabul. The main invasion 
began at 3 p.m. (local time) on December 25.^^ 

According to some accounts of the Soviet invasion, 
Amin was successfully duped into believing that the Red 
Army was arriving to provide him with “fraternal 
assistance” against anti-Communist rebels. The Kabul 
residency thought otherwise. On December 26 it reported 
to the Centre the publication of an article in the 
Englishlanguage Kabul Times entitled “The Will of the 



People will be the Deciding Factor.” Though the article 
made no direct reference to the massive arrival of Soviet 
troops, it ended with the slogan “Down with the 
interventionists!” The residency concluded: 

As the Afghan press is subject to strict censorship, 
the article could not have been published without the 
sanction of Amin. The time chosen to print the 
article was not a coincidence. It was printed in an 
English language newspaper, a language which few 
Afghans understand. It was clearly intended to turn 
the pro-Western sections of the population against 
the Soviet troops and to enable the mass media in the 
West to make an immediate fuss about the Soviet 
intervention in Afghanistan. In general the article 
reflects the ambiguous and cautious attitude of Amin 
and his entourage towards the increased Soviet 
military presence in Afghanistan.^^ 

The assault on the presidential palace on December 27 
was led by 700 members of the KGB Alpha and Zenith 
special forces, dressed in Afghan uniforms and traveling 
in military vehicles with Afghan markings. The signal for 
the attack to begin was the detonation of an explosive 
device concealed some days earlier beneath a tree in the 
central square of the capital. The palace guards, however, 
put up much stiffer resistance than had been expected, and 
over a hundred of the KGB troops were killed before the 



palace was taken and Amin gunned down. Among the 
casualties was the leader of the assault group, Colonel 
Grigori Boyarinov, commandant of the Department 8 
special operations training school at Balashikha.^^ 

It was normal KGB procedure for the portraits of 
officers who fell in combat to be displayed in black 
frames at the Centre as a sign of mourning. On this 
occasion, since the fallen heroes of operation AGAT were 
so numerous, Andropov decided not to put their hundred 
portraits on display. Some of the survivors, however, 
were honored for their part in the operation. Kirpichenko 
was promoted from major-general to lieutenant-general, 
and soon afterwards made First Deputy Head of the FCD. 
Lazarenko was promoted from colonel to major-general. 
Leonid Aleksandrovich Kozlov of Department 8 was 
made a Hero of the Soviet Union.^^ The head of Line N 
(Illegals Support) at the Kabul residency, Ismail Murtuza 
Ogly Aliev, was awarded the Order of the Red Star, as 
were an unknown number of the members of the assault 
group who had stormed the presidential palace. 

Immediately after the storming of the palace, the exiled 
Afghan Communist and veteran KGB agent Babrak 
Karmal, who had been chosen by Moscow to succeed 
Amin, asked senior KGB officers in Kabul to assure 
Comrade Andropov that, as president, he would 
unswervingly follow his advice. He also called for the 
“severest punishment” of Amin’s former associates and 



all those who had opposed Soviet troops. Karmal was 
fulsome in his praise for the heroism shown by the KGB 
and other special forces who had stormed the presidential 
palace: 

As soon as we have decorations of our own, we 
would like to bestow them on all the Soviet troops 
and Chekists [KGB officers] who took part in the 
fighting. We hope that the government of the USSR 
will award orders to these comrades. 

The long-drawn-out Afghan War (which will be covered 
in volume 2 of this book) rescued Department 8 from the 
doldrums into which it had lapsed for most of the 1970s. 
In 1982 its special operations training school at 
Balashikha set up a “Training Centre for Afghanistan,” 
headed by V. I. Kikot, previously a Line F officer in 
Havana, who was well-informed on the Cuban experience 
of irregular warfare. Department 8 also made an 
intensive study of the methods used both by the 
Palestinians against the Israelis and by the Israelis against 
Palestinian camps in Lebanon.^^ Balashikha made a 
significant, though unquantifiable, contribution to the 
increasing use of special forces and methods of terrorizing 
the population — among them incendiary bombs, napalm, 
poison gas, tiny mines scattered from the air, even booby- 
trapped toys which maimed children and so demoralized 
their parents. But though Soviet forces and the terror 



campaign drove a quarter of the Afghan population into 
refugee camps in Pakistan, they failed to win the war. 


WITH THE INTENSIFICATION of the Cold War in the 
early years of the Reagan presidency and fears in the 
Centre that the new president was planning a nuclear first 
strike, Andropov became increasingly willing, both as 
KGB chairman and as Brezhnev’s successor from 1982 to 
1984, to use, or connive in the use of, terrorism against 
United States and NATO targets. With Andropov’s 
knowledge (and doubtless his blessing). East Germany 
became what its last, non-Communist, interior minister, 
Peter-Michael Diestel, later called “an Eldorado for 
terrorists.” Among East Germany’s favorite terrorist 
groups was the West German Red Army Faction (RAF). 
Contemptuous of working-class reluctance to make a 
revolution and inspired by slogans such as “Don’t argue 
— destroy!,” the well-educated members of the RAF saw 
themselves as the militant vanguard of the deplorably 
inert proletariat, committed to the destruction of the 
“bourgeois power structures” of both the ERG and 
NATO. After a series of successful terrorist attacks in the 
mid-1970s, however, a grand offensive planned by the 
RAF in 1977 failed, and four of its leaders committed 
suicide in prison. 

Thanks to the sanctuary offered by East Germany to its 
main surviving activists from 1977 onwards, the RAF was 
able to regroup. With training, weapons, funds and false 



identity documents provided by the Stasi, the Red Army 
Faction launched a new offensive during the early 1980s. 
In August 1981 a car bomb attack on the European 
headquarters of the US airforce at Ramstein in West 
Germany injured seventeen people; a month later RAF 
terrorists made an unsuccessful rocket attack in 
Heidelberg on the car of General Frederick Kroesen. 
During another terrorist offensive in 1984-5, the RAF 
attempted to blow up the NATO school at 
Oberammergau, bombed the US airbase at 
Frankfurt/Main, and attacked American soldiers at 
Wiesbaden. The Stasi also connived in the bombing of the 
La Belle discotheque in West Berlin, helping to transport 
the explosives which killed an American sergeant and a 
Turkish woman and wounded 230 people, including fifty 
US servicemen. Other Stasi contacts included the 
Provisional IRA, the Basque ETA and Carlos the 
Jackal.^^ 

In 1983, at the height of operation RYAN (the 
combined KGB/GRU attempt to find (nonexistent) 
evidence of US and NATO plans for a surprise nuclear 
attack), Andropov ordered preparations by Department 8 
for terrorist attacks on British, American and NATO 
targets in Europe. Plans were made for a campaign of 
letter bombs to be sent to Mrs. Thatcher’s office at 10 
Downing Street and to a series of prominent US and 
NATO representatives.^^ At about the same time the KGB 
organized a series of dead drops in bars and restaurants 



near American bases in West Germany, intended to 
conceal explosives which could be detonated in a manner 
that would give the impression of terrorist attacks. The 
dead drop sites included behind a vending machine, in a 
ventilation cavity under a sink, on a wooden beam over a 
lavatory and underneath a paper-towel dispenser. By the 
time the sites were discovered by the CIA in 1985, 
however, operation RYAN was winding down and plans 
for a KGB terrorist campaign against NATO targets had 
been shelved.^^ 

In August 1983, while RYAN was still in full swing, 
the Centre instructed the main residencies in European 
NATO countries to step up their search for NATO 
preparations for 

the secret infiltration of sabotage teams with nuclear, 
bacteriological and chemical weapons into the 
countries of the Warsaw Pact; [and] the expansion of 
the network of sabotage-training intelligence schools 
and increase in the recruitment of emigres from the 
socialist countries and persons who know the 
language of these countries, and the creation of 
emigre military formations and sabotage and 
intelligence teams. 

Though, as with most of the requirements for operation 
RYAN, there was no such intelligence to collect, the 
Centre’s instructions give an important insight into 



Moscow’s contingency plans for the role of Department 8 
and its DRGs in an attack on NATO. 


THE DECLINE AND fall of the Cold War brought a 
further decline in KGB special actions. The last major 
special action of the Soviet era was directed not against 
the traditional Main Adversary and its NATO allies, but 
against the reformers within the Soviet Union. On 
December 8, 1990 Kryuchkov, who had become KGB 
chairman two years earlier, summoned to his office in the 
Lubyanka his former chief-of-staff, Vyacheslav Zhizhin, 
now deputy chief of the FCD, and Alexei Yegorov of 
Counter-intelligence. There he instructed them to prepare 
a report on the measures needed to “stabilize” the country 
following the declaration of a state of emergency — in 
other words, the “special” and other actions required to 
preserve one-party rule and a centralized Soviet state. 

Over the next eight months Kryuchkov repeatedly tried 
and failed to persuade Gorbachev to agree to the 
declaration of a state of emergency and the “stabilization” 
of the Soviet Union. The point of no return for himself 
and his co-conspirators was the agreement on July 23, 
1991 of the text of a new Union Treaty which would have 
transferred many of the powers of central government to 
the republics. On August 4 Gorbachev, whom Kryuchkov 
had placed under close surveillance some months earlier 
as SUBJECT 110, left for his summer holidays in a 
luxurious dacha at Foros on the Crimean coast, intending 



to return to Moscow for the signing of the Union Treaty 
on August 20. The day after Gorbachev’s departure, 
Kryuchkov and his fellow plotters — chief among them the 
defence and interior ministers, Dmitri Yazov and Boris 
Pugo (former head of the Latvian KGB) — met at 
OBJECT ABC, a KGB sanatorium equipped with 
swimming pool, saunas, masseuses and cinema. There 
they secretly constituted themselves as the State 
Committee for the State of Emergency, and met over the 
next fortnight to make preparations for a coup which 
would forestall the signing of the Union Treaty. The 
committee ordered the printing of 300,000 arrest forms 
and the supply by a factory in Pskov of 250,000 pairs of 
handcuffs. Kryuchkov called all KGB personnel back 
from holiday, placed them on alert and doubled their pay. 
Two floors of cells in the Lefortovo prison were emptied 
to received important prisoners and a secret bunker 
prepared for the committee in the Lubyanka in case the 
going got rough. 

On August 18 the plotters made a final attempt to 
intimidate Gorbachev into declaring a state of emergency. 
Having failed, they kept him incommunicado under house 
arrest in Foros and announced next day that the president 
was prevented by “ill health” from performing his duties, 
and that Vice-President Gennadi Yanayev had become 
acting president (in fact a mere figurehead) at the head of 
an eight-man State Committee for the State of 
Emergency. The plotters quickly discovered, however. 



that the old autocratic machinery of the one-party state 
was in too serious a state of disrepair for them to be able 
to turn back the clock. The Alpha group spetsnaz was 
supposed to storm the Moscow White House, the seat of 
government of the Russian Federation, and arrest its 
president, Boris Yeltsin, but failed to do either. Not one of 
the 7,000 reformers on the plotters’ detention list was 
arrested. The coup crumbled farcically and ignominiously 
in only four days. Pugo committed suicide. “Forgive me,” 
he wrote in a note to his children and grandchildren. “It 
was all a mistake. I lived honestly, all my life.” As Yazov 
was being led to a prison van, he said to those who 
arrested him, “Everything is clear now. I am such an old 
idiot. I’ve really fucked up.” Kryuchkov lacked sufficient 
self-knowledge to reach a similar conclusion. 

The result of the final special action organized by the 
KGB was thus the precise opposite of what Kryuchkov 
and his fellow plotters had intended, accelerating both the 
collapse of the Communist one-party state and the 
disintegration of the Soviet Union. The coup also ended in 
unprecedented humiliation for the KGB. On the evening 
of August 21 a heavy crane arrived in front of the 
Lubyanka and, before a cheering crowd, hoisted the giant 
statue of Felix Dzerzhinsky by a noose around his neck, 
toppled him from his pedestal and dragged him away to a 
field near the Tretyakov gallery, which became a 
graveyard for statues of the Soviet regime. 



APPENDIX 



“SPECIAL POLITICAL ACTION” 
PROPOSED BY THE ATHENS 
RESIDENCY TO THE CENTRE IN 

APRIL 1969 


Our operational letter no. 24/[Line]F of April 14, 1969 
sets out a draft plan for carrying out a Lily [sabotage 
operation] against the target codenamed VAZA [“Vase”]. 

The operation is codenamed YAYTSO [“Egg”]. 

The aim and purpose of the operation is to cause moral 
and political damage to the south-east wing of NATO. 

Constant disagreements between Greece and Turkey 
cause great concern to the leadership of the USA and 
NATO and are a weak link in American policy in the area 
of southeast Europe. 

Carrying out a Lily on the VAZA could exacerbate 
relations between Greece and Turkey. 

The operation would be carried out in the name of a 
Greek who had come from Turkey and was dissatisfied 
with the situation of the Greek minority there (there can 
also be another variant [pretext] for carrying out the 



sabotage). 

VAZA is a two-storey house in Thessaloniki. The 
house and its annex belong to the Turkish consulate- 
general . . . There is no furniture, only a table, iron 
troughs and a cooking stove. 

On the upper floor of the house there are displays with 
Atat;Anrk [the Turkish national heroj’s clothes and a 
photographic portrait of him. Apart from a desk there is 
no furniture. 

Next to the VAZA, about 15-20 m away, there is the 
two-storey building of the Turkish consulate-general. This 
house is also used as living accommodation for consulate 
officials. 

The VAZA and the consulate have a common 
courtyard. (A detailed description of the layout of the 
houses and the courtyard is attached.) 

The most suitable place for planting a Bouquet 
[explosive device] is in the bushes growing about one 
meter from the VAZA. 

The VAZA is not open to the general public. It can be 
visited with the permission of the Turkish consulate; a 
special official is assigned to watch over the VAZA and 
to accompany visitors to the VAZA. 

The VAZA and the consulate are guarded round the 
clock by two gendarmes. The guard posts are mobile and 
the approaches to VAZA are restricted. The most 
convenient time to approach the target is at nightfall. 

Specifications of the Bouquet: 



The size and weight of the Bouquet must be related to 
the results which are desired from the attack on the 
VAZA. Evidently, there is no point in causing serious 
damage to the VAZA; it is better to achieve a moral and 
political effect. When calculating the force of the 
Bouquet, one must bear in mind that the distance from the 
Splash [explosion] to the consulate living quarters is 15- 
20 m. 

... In order to increase the impact and achieve the 
desired results, the Bouquet must be wrapped in a 
newspaper published in Turkey for Greek citizens. 

The temperature in Thessaloniki ranges in winter from 
below zero to 14°C, while in summer it ranges from 24°C 
upwards. Occasionally there are thick fogs. 

The Gardener [saboteur] must be sent to the country as 
a foreign tourist at the height of the tourist season. The 
greatest influx of tourists occurs from June to August. 
According to his identity documents, the Gardener’s 
identity documents must show him to be a citizen of a 
country friendly to Greece or a neutral state (the USA, 
Britain, West Germany, Austria, France, Italy, Canada, 
Libya), excluding the Scandinavian countries, Denmark, 
Holland and Belgium. 

On arriving in Athens the Gardener can hire a motor 
car, visit historical sites in the south of the country and 
some of the islands. Simultaneously, the Gardener is 
acclimatizing himself and becoming fully accustomed to 
the situation in the country. 



After collecting the Bouquet from the residency via a 
DLB [dead letterbox], the Gardener travels to 
Thessaloniki by rail. 

The estimated time span for carrying out the Lily and 
for the Gardener’s activities is as follows: 

AFTER ARRIVING IN Athens, the Gardener can hire a 
motor car the next day, spend one or two days in Athens 
and its suburbs, then travel the following route by car: 
Athens-Patrais-Spartia-Navplion-Epidhauros-Kointhos- 
Athens. This route will take the Gardener four or five 
days. On arriving in Athens, the Gardener books into a 
hotel. The next day he places a signal indicating he is 
ready to carry out the DLB operation to receive the 
Bouquet. The DLB operation takes place next day. 

After collecting the Bouquet, the Gardener leaves by 
the next train to Thessaloniki, having previously booked 
out from the hotel. A train leaves Athens at 11:42, and 
arrives at Thessaloniki at 19:29; he travels in a first-class 
compartment. 

At Thessaloniki he does not stay at a hotel. In order to 
acquaint himself with the situation around the VAZA he 
walks past the VAZA after checking for surveillance. 

As darkness falls, the Gardener goes off on a route of 
his own choice, but at the final stage goes into the old 
fort, where he inserts the little flower [detonator] into the 
Bouquet. From the northern gates of the fort, the 
Gardener goes down Isail Street which leads to the VAZA 



and comes out on St. Paul Street. This takes 15-20 
minutes. 

On coming out on to Isail Street, the Gardener goes 
from the garage towards St. Paul Street. While moving 
along the [VAZA] fence, the Gardener causes the Splash 
[explosion]. The Gardener can throw the Bouquet into the 
bushes which are close to the VAZA fence or he can drop 
the Bouquet on the ground inside the VAZA fence. (A 
diagram of the route and of the location of the 
installations is attached.) 

After completing the Splash, the Gardener goes out on 
Ayios Dhimitrios Street and moves in the direction of the 
stadium (20-25 minutes walk). In the stadium area there is 
some waste ground where the Gardener can bury the 
TWA or BO AC airline bag used for keeping and 
transporting the Bouquet. From Thessaloniki, the 
Gardener can go to Athens by train or air (buying the air 
ticket 5-10 minutes before takeoff, using any surname). 

If the situation does not permit the Gardener to put the 
Bouquet together, then he can get rid of it ... in the area 
of the stadium where there is some waste ground. If he 
attracts the attention of the VAZA security guard, he must 
say that he is a foreign tourist going from the fort to the 
Delta Hotel, where he intends to spend the night, but that 
this is his first visit to the town and he is not sure of the 
way to the hotel. 



TWENTY - FOUR 


COLD WAR OPERATIONS AGAINST 

BRITAIN 


Part 1: After the Magnificent Five 


Soviet intelligence operations in Britain from the 1930s 
onward fall into three distinct phases. First, there was a 
golden age, begun by the Great Illegals, during which the 
KGB collected better intelligence (even if it did not 
always understand it) than any other hostile intelligence 
agency in British history. Next came a silver age during 
the 1950s and 1960s, which included fewer — though still 
substantial — intelligence successes. The third phase, in 
the 1970s and 1980s, qualifies, at best, as a bronze age, 
successes. The third phase, in the 1970s and 1980s, 
qualifies, at best, as a bronze age, with few major 
successes and some spectacular failures. 

The golden age of Soviet intelligence operations in 
Britain came to an end in 1951 with the flight of Burgess 



and Maclean to Moscow and the recall of Philby from 
Washington.^ The files noted by Mitrokhin, however, 
reveal for the first time that one major ideological agent 
recruited in the mid- 1930s, Melita Norwood (HOLA), 
continued to operate after the demise of the Magnificent 
Five.^ From March 1945 onward, while working in the 
research department of the British Non-Ferrous Metals 
Association, she had been able to provide intelligence on 
the TUBE ALLOYS project to build Britain’s first atomic 
bomb. 

After the Second World War there was a recurrence of 
the wartime rivalry between NKGB and GRU for control 
of Norwood. Her first post-war controller was an 
NKGB/MGB officer at the London residency, Nikolai 
Pavlovich Ostrovsky. During the Committee of 
Information (KI) period in the early Cold War, however, 
when the MGB and GRU combined their foreign 
intelligence services, Norwood had two GRU controllers: 
Galina Konstantinovna Tursevich and Yevgeni 
Aleksandrovich Oleynik. In April 1950, following the 
conviction of the atom spy Klaus Fuchs and the MI5 
interrogation of SONYA, the wartime GRU controller of 
both Norwood and Fuchs, Norwood was temporarily put 
“on ice” for fear that she might have been compromised. 
Contact, however, was resumed in 1951. Within about a 
year, following the demise of the Committee of 
Information, control of Norwood was reclaimed by the 



Centre from the GRU.^ 

In October 1952, a few months after Norwood returned 
to the MGB, the first British atomic bomb was 
successfully tested on the Monte Bello islands off the 
north-west coast of Australia, hitherto known chiefly for 
their pearl divers and shipwrecks. Stalin had been far 
better briefed on the construction of the bomb than most 
British ministers. Attlee never allowed discussion of the 
TUBE ALLOYS project by his whole cabinet, later 
claiming censoriously that “some of them were not fit to 
be trusted with secrets of this kind.” Churchill was 
amazed, after winning the 1951 election, to discover that 
Attlee had concealed the 100-million-pound cost of the 
atomic bomb from both Parliament and most of his 
ministers.^ 

Over the next twenty years Norwood had seven 
different controllers: six officers of the KGB London 
residency (Yevgeni Aleksandrovich Belov, Georgi 
Leonidovich Trusevich, Nikolai Nikolayevich Asimov, 
Vitali Yevgenovich Tseyrov, Gennadi Borosovich 
Myakinkov and Lev Nikolayevich Sherstnev) and one 
illegal (BEN). For security reasons Norwood actually met 
her controllers only four or five times a year, usually in 
the suburbs of south-east London to hand over the 
documents she had been collecting.^ 

The rivalry between the Centre and the GRU for 
control of Norwood during the Second World War and 



the early Cold War — decided in both cases in the Centre’s 
favor — gives a clear indication of her importance as an 
agent. According to her file, some of the S&T which she 
supplied “found practical application in Soviet industry.” 
(Mitrokhin’s notes, alas, give no further details.) In 1958 
HOLA was awarded the Order of the Red Banner. Two 
years later she was rewarded with a life pension of 20 
pounds a month, payable with immediate effect, despite 
the fact that she was twelve years off from retirement at 
the Non-Ferrous Metals Association. Norwood, however, 
was an ideological agent who did not work for money. 
After her retirement she refused further payment, saying 
she had enough to live on and did not need it.^ 

Norwood also acted as agent-recruiter. The only recruit 
identified in Mitrokhin’s notes, however, is the civil 
servant HUNT, whose cultivation Norwood began in 
1965. In the fourteen years after HUNT’S recruitment in 
1967, he provided S&T and intelligence on British arms 
sales (on which no further details are available). In the 
late 1970s the London residency gave him 9,000 pounds 
to found a small business, probably in the hope that he 
could use it to supply embargoed technology.^ 

SO FAR AS is known, no Soviet agent recruited after the 
Second World War ever penetrated the British 
intelligence community quite as successfully as Philby, 
Blunt and Caimcross. Within a few months of Philby ’s 
dismissal from SIS in June 1951, however, the MGB 



began the recruitment of another SIS officer, the 29-year- 
old George Blake, ne Behar. Blake had been bom in 
Rotterdam of a naturalized British father (by origin a 
Sephardic Jew from Constantinople) and a Dutch mother 
who called their son George in honor of King George V. 
During the Second World War Blake served successively 
in the Dutch Resistance and in the Royal Navy, before 
joining SIS in 1944. There was much that SIS had failed 
to discover about its new recmit, notably the influence on 
him of his older cousin, Henri Curiel, co-founder of the 
Egyptian Communist Party, a man — according to Blake — 
with “immense charm and a dazzling smile [which] made 
him very attractive, not only to women, but to all who met 
him.” In 1949 Blake was posted by SIS to South Korea, 
working under diplomatic cover as vice-consul in Seoul. 
A year later, shortly after the outbreak of the Korean War, 
he was interned by the invading North Koreans.^ 

In the autumn of 1951 Blake handed his captors a note, 
written in Russian and addressed to the Soviet embassy, 
saying that he had important information to communicate. 
At a meeting with Vasili Alekseyevich Dozhdalev of the 
KGB, he identified himself as an SIS officer and 
volunteered to work as a Soviet agent. Following a 
favorable assessment by Dozhdalev, the London resident, 
Nikolai Borisovich Rodin (alias “Korovin”), traveled to 
Korea to complete Blake’s recruitment as agent DIO- 
MID, and arranged to meet him in the Netherlands after 
the end of the Korean War. According to Sergei 



Aleksandrovich Kondrashev, who became Blake’s 
controller in Britain in October 1953, the Centre 
considered him so important that no other member of the 
London residency was permitted to know either 
DIOMID’S identity or the fact that he worked for SIS.^ 

KGB files give Blake the credit for two major 
successes during the 1950s. First, his intelligence — 
together with previous information from Philby and that 
supplied by Heinz Felfe,^^ a Soviet agent in the West 
German BND — is said to have made possible the 
“elimination of the adversary’s agent network in the GDR 
in 1953-5.”^^ In his memoirs, published in 1990, Blake 
claimed that he had betrayed almost 400 Western agents 
in the Soviet Bloc, but insisted that none had come to any 
harm — an improbable assertion swiftly denied by, among 
others, Oleg Kalugin. According to Blake, some of those 
he betrayed “are today taking an active part in the 
democratic movements of their respective countries in 
eastern Europe.” Many more, however, were executed in 
the 1950s.^^ 

Blake’s second major achievement as a Soviet agent 
was to alert the Centre to one of the most remarkable 
Western intelligence operations of the Cold War — the 
secret construction of a 500-meter underground tunnel 
from West to East Berlin built to intercept landlines 
running from the Soviet military and intelligence 
headquarters in Karlshorst. At a meeting with his 



controller on the top deck of a London bus in January 
1954, Blake handed over a carbon copy of the minutes of 
an SIS — CIA conference on the tunnel project, 
codenamed operation GOLD. Blake was posted to the SIS 
Berlin station in April 1955, one month before the tunnel 
became operational. The Centre, however, dared not 
interfere either with the tunnel’s construction or with its 
early operations for fear of compromising Blake, who had 
established himself as by far its most important British 
agent. 

By the time the KGB staged an “accidental” discovery 
of the tunnel in April 1956, operation GOLD had yielded 
over 50,000 reels of magnetic tape recording intercepted 
Soviet and East German communications. The 
intelligence yield was so considerable that it took over 
two years after the end of the operation to process all the 
intercepts. Though the FCD was able to protect its own 
communications, it was curiously indifferent to the 
interception of those of the rival GRU and of Soviet 
armed forces. There is no evidence to support past claims 
that the intelligence generated by operation GOLD was 
muddied by significant amounts of KGB disinformation. 
CIA and SIS intelligence reports on the operation 
contained important new information on the improved 
nuclear capability of the Soviet air force in East Germany; 
its new fleet of bombers and twin-jet radar-equipped 
interceptors; the doubling of Soviet bomber strength and 
the creation of a new fighter division in Poland; over one 



hundred air force installations in the USSR, GDR and 
Poland; the organization, bases and personnel of the 
Soviet Baltic Fleet; and installations and personnel of the 
Soviet atomic energy program. In the era before spy 
planes and spy satellites (the first U-2 overflight of the 
Soviet Union did not occur until July 1956), this 
intelligence was of particular value to a West still ignorant 
about much of the capability of the Soviet armed forces. 

One of the messages intercepted in the Berlin tunnel 
revealed the existence of a Soviet agent working for 
British intelligence in Berlin, but it was not until 1961 
that evidence from the Polish SB defector Michal 
Goleniewski identified the agent as Blake. Blake was 
sentenced to forty- two years in jail but served only five 
before escaping from Wormwood Scrubs with the help of 
three former inmates who had befriended him, the Irish 
bomber Sean Bourke and the peace protesters Michael 
Randle and Pat Pottle. On October 22, 1966 Blake 
knocked a loosened iron bar out of his cell window, slid 
down the roof outside and dropped to the ground, then 
climbed over the outer wall with a nylon rope ladder 
thrown to him by Bourke. Hidden in the Randle family 
dormobile, Blake was driven to East Berlin, where a 
fortnight later he was joined by Bourke. Once in Moscow, 
Blake and Bourke rapidly fell out. Blake writes in his 
memoirs that, “Arrangements were made for [Bourke] to 
return to Ireland.” He does not mention, and may not 



have known, that on the instructions of Sakharovsky, the 
head of the FCD, Bourke was given before his departure a 
drug designed to cause brain damage and thus limit his 
potential usefulness if he fell into the hands of British 
intelligence. Bourke ’s premature death in his early forties 
probably owed as much to KGB drugs as to his own 
heavy drinking. ^ ^ 

WHILE RUNNING BLAKE as an agent inside SIS 
during the 1950s, the KGB also had ambitious plans to 
recruit leading British politicians. Among the targets 
recorded in the files noted by Mitrokhin was Tom 
Driberg, Labor MP, journalist, member of Labor’s 
National Executive from 1949 to 1974 and party chairman 
in 1957-8.^^ In 1956, shortly after Burgess and Maclean 
gave the first press conference since their flight to 
Moscow, claiming to have come to Moscow “to work for 
the aim of better understanding between the Soviet Union 
and the West,” Driberg provided the opportunity for his 
own recruitment by requesting an interview with 
Burgess. The two men had become friends during the 
War — ^brought together by common interests which 
included, according to Driberg’ s biographer, “contempt 
for the bourgeoisie” and “healthy appetites for alcohol 
and young men.”^^ With the approval of the KGB, 
Burgess agreed to the interview, doubtless informing the 
Centre that Driberg was one of the most promiscuous 



homosexuals in British public life. 

Whenever it saw an opportunity, the Second Chief 
Directorate (SCD) went to great pains to compromise 
foreign diplomats and Western politicians visiting 
Moscow by using female or male “swallows” to seduce 
them, photographing their sexual liaisons and then 
blackmailing them into “cooperation.” A year before 
Driberg visited Moscow, for example, John Vassall, a 
homosexual clerk in the office of the British naval attache 
at the British embassy, had been lured to a party 
organized by the SCD. Soon afterward, Vassall recalled: 

I was shown a box of photographs of myself at the 
party . . . After about three photographs I could not 
stomach any more. They made one feel ill. There I 
was, caught by the camera, enjoying every sexual 
activity . . . having oral, anal or a complicated array 
of sexual activities with a number of different men. 

For the next seven years, while working at the Moscow 
embassy and at the Admiralty in London, Vassall handed 
over thousands of highly classified documents on British 
and NATO weapons development and naval policy.^^ 

As a compulsive “cottager” in public lavatories, 
Driberg proved even easier to recruit than Vassall. Instead 
of being compromised by an elaborate SCD sexual 
entrapment, Driberg obligingly compromised himself. 
During his visit to Moscow he discovered, to his delight. 



“a large underground urinal just behind the Metropole 
Hotel, open all night, frequented by hundreds of questing 
Slav homosexuals — standing there in rigid exhibitionist 
rows, motionless save for the hasty grope and the anxious 
or beckoning glance over the shoulder — and tended only 
by an old woman cleaner who never seemed to notice 
what was going on.”^^ If the cleaner failed to notice the 
distinguished British visitor to the urinal, the KGB 
undoubtedly did not. Among Driberg’s sexual partners on 
that or subsequent evenings in Moscow was an agent of 
the Second Chief Directorate. Soon afterward, Driberg 
was confronted with “compromising material” on his 
sexual encounters (probably photographs similar to those 
shown to Vassall) and recruited as agent LEPAGE.^^ 
Somewhat absurdly, in view of the use of blackmail, 
Driberg’s file alleges that “ideological affinity,” going 
back to his teenage membership of the Communist Party, 
played a subsidiary part in his recruitment. 

For the next twelve years, Driberg was used both as a 
source of inside information from the Labor National 
Executive and to promote active measures. The 
importance of his role within the Labor Party may well 
have been exaggerated by the Centre, especially after he 
became party chairman in 1957. “Even before he held this 
post, whose nature often misleads foreign observers,” 
writes the political commentator Alan Watkins, “Driberg 
was assumed by several Russian politicians to be leader 



of the Labor Party. This was on account partly of his great 
episcopal manner, and partly of his ability to get on well 
with Russians. Driberg was, none the less, wonderfully 
placed to report to his controller on both the evolution of 
Labor policy and the rivalries within the Party leadership. 
His mixture of political information and gossip was so 
highly rated by the KGB that it was passed on to the 
Politburo. 

Driberg ’s first active measure as agent LEPAGE was 
the publication in 1956 of a disingenuous study of Guy 
Burgess which concluded that he had never been a Soviet 
agent. At the time Driberg was temporarily out of the 
Commons, working as a freelance journalist, seriously 
short of money and being hounded by his bank manager. 
The book on Burgess brought him more money than 
anything else in his writing career, including the then- 
astounding sum of 5,000 pounds for its serialization in the 
Daily Mail?^ After his initial meeting with Burgess in 
Moscow, Driberg went back to London, drafted in about a 
month a short biography entitled Guy Burgess: A Portrait 
with Background, then returned to Moscow to go through 
the proofs. “Presumably,” he wrote later, “Guy had shown 
each chapter to his colleagues or superiors. The proofs, 
in other words, had been carefully vetted by the KGB. 

Driberg later described how, during their evenings 
together in Moscow, he had seen Burgess “getting a bit 
sozzled on vodka.” The KGB, however, would tolerate no 



reference to Burgess’s alcoholism. Driberg’s biography 
thus quotes Burgess as saying that, despite his previous 
heavy drinking in the West, he no longer drank vodka in 
Moscow except — improbably — as “the best cure for an 
upset stomach:” “You know, Tom, living in a Socialist 
country does have a therapeutic effect on one.” Driberg 
praised the “passionate sincerity” of Burgess’s 
convictions and “his courage in doing what he thought 
right” to work for “better understanding between the 
Soviet Union and the West.” Burgess and Maclean, 
claimed Driberg, had been the victims of British media 
attacks as outrageous as “the extreme excesses of the 
McCarthy witch hunt” in the United States: 

That does not mean that I personally agree with the 
decision that Burgess and Maclean took. As a 
Socialist, I take the view that, on the whole, one 
should go on working for Socialism by such means 
as are available in one’s own country — in Britain, 
specifically, through the Labor Party. But this is a 
matter on which opinions differ . . . 

While it was “silly for Western Socialists to defend every 
action of the Soviet Government,” the achievements of 
Soviet industrial democracy deserved to be better known 
in the West. Driberg extolled the example of a Party 
meeting he had attended in a Moscow machine-tool 
factory: 



At this meeting a large percentage of those available 
to attend were present voluntarily to take an active, 
proud and responsible part in the running of their 
factory; and they seemed to feel that it was indeed 
theirs, as the workers at a factory in Dagenham or 
Coventry or Detroit can never, as things are, feel that 
the factories in which they work are theirs. 

The propaganda impact of Driberg’s book was 
somewhat spoiled by the fact that, just as it was published 
in November 1956, Soviet tanks entered Budapest to 
crush the Hungarian Uprising. His KGB file records, 
however, that he continued to be used for KGB active 
measures.^^ Though Mitrokhin’s summary of the file 
gives few details, the Centre probably considered 
Driberg’s main use as an agent of influence to support the 
campaign within the Labor Party for unilateral nuclear 
disarmament. At the Scarborough party conference in 
October 1960, the left proved strong enough to pass two 
unilateralist motions, despite the impassioned opposition 
of Hugh Gaitskell, party leader, who implored his 
supporters to “fight and fight and fight again to save the 
party we love.” Doubtless to the Centre’s delight, Driberg 
was made a member of the “Committee of Twelve,” 
appointed by the NEC to draft a new defense policy. 
Though Gaitskell complained that Driberg was behaving 
on the committee “like a tired snake,” his supporters 
pushed through a pro-NATO and antiunilateralist policy 



later adopted by the 1961 party conference, which 
reversed the vote at Scarborough a year earlier. 

It is unlikely that, after the publication of his biography 
of Guy Burgess, the KGB had any major subsequent 
influence on Driberg’s speeches and articles — though it 
doubtless tried to claim some of the credit for his 
denunciation of the British nuclear deterrent and 
America’s role in Vietnam. Driberg’s campaigns on these 
and other left-wing causes sprang from conviction rather 
than KGB dictation. His main usefulness to the Centre 
probably lay in enabling it to boast to the Politburo that it 
had an agent at the heart of the Labor leadership who 
would probably figure in the next Labor government. 

The Centre was doubtless deeply disappointed when 
there was no place for Driberg in the government formed 
by Gaitskell’s successor, Harold Wilson, after the Labor 
election victory of 1964. Wilson distrusted him too much 
to think of making him a minister.^ ^ Together with Ian 
Mikardo, Driberg formed the left-wing Tribune Group, 
which opposed many of Wilson’s policies from the back 
benches. After Wilson won an increased majority in 1966, 
however, the Tribune Group’s protests became less 
effective. The Daily Express compared the impact of a 
protest organized by Driberg and Mikardo against a 
proposed wage freeze to that of “a piece of wet cod 
dropping in a snowdrift. Driberg began to try to 
distance himself from the KGB, end secret contacts and 



limit himself to official meetings with Soviet diplomats 
and intelligence officers under diplomatic cover. When 
the KGB tried to increase pressure on him, he broke off 
contact altogether in 1968.^^ 

Agent LEPAGE’S decision — in KGB jargon — to 
“refuse to cooperate” may have been related to his 
worsening health. In January 1968, while on a tour of 
Cyprus as chairman of the Parliamentary Labor Party, he 
had a minor heart attack. Though warned that the attack 
might have been triggered by “overdoing it” sexually, 
Driberg insisted on inviting Cypriot youths into his 
hospital bed. Later in the year, after his return to London, 
he spent several further months in hospital with a 
detached retina, becoming blind in one eye. At the end of 
1970, he decided to retire at the following election. 

It is uncertain whether Wilson ever learned from MI5 
that Driberg was a Soviet agent. He was, however, 
informed in the late 1960s that a defector from the 
Czechoslovak StB, Josif Frolik, had reported that Driberg 
had been in the pay of the StB.^^ Frolik claimed that the 
StB had been warned off by the KGB on the grounds that 
Driberg was “their man.”^^ Mitrokhin’s brief summary of 
Driberg ’s file contains no reference to a Czech 
connection. But his notes on the file of another agent in 
the Labor Party, the journalist Raymond Fletcher, who 
served as MP for Ilkeston from 1964 to 1983, record that 
he was involved with the StB as well as the KGB. 



When Fletcher (codenamed PETER) was recruited by 
the London residency in 1962,^^ he was preparing a 
scathing attack on Conservative defense policy, published 
in the following year under the title £60 a Second on 
Defense, which called for major defense cuts and the 
abandonment of the British nuclear deterrent. Fletcher 
ridiculed most of the security measures designed to 
prevent British defense secrets reaching the Soviet Union. 
“Classification,” he declared, “is more a device for 
concealing incompetence than for concealing information 
from a potential enemy:” 

If the object of the deterrent exercise is to convince 
the Soviet Union that . . . “unacceptable damage” can 
be inflicted if aggression is embarked upon, why 
conceal the methods by which it is to be inflicted? 
We do not, of course. Such is the dismal state of our 
security procedures that it is a safe bet that more is 
known about British security procedures in the 
Kremlin than in the House of Commons. 

Shortly before his election as Labor MP in 1964, the 
Centre learned that Fletcher was also “cooperating” with 
the StB. On this occasion, instead of warning off the 
Czechs — as allegedly happened in the case of Driberg — 
the KGB seems to have broken off contact with Fletcher. 
The Centre was also disturbed by a report from the Polish 
SB that a letter in the possession of the British 



Communist Party appeared to show (almost certainly 
wrongly) that Fletcher had been “cooperating” since 1957 
with the CIA.^^ 

A few months before his death in 1991, Fletcher 
admitted that during the 1960s he had contacts at the 
Czechoslovak embassy in London whom “it was later 
claimed were intelligence personnel,” but that he had 
thought “I was safe because I reported all my contacts to 
Goronwy Roberts at the Foreign Office.” MI5, he 
implied, thought differently. They were, he declared, “a 
complete bunch of bastards” who “tried to break my 
nerve and nearly broke my spirit. If, as Fletcher 
believed, MI5 did have him under surveillance, his KGB 
file suggests that they had some reason to do so. 

The most important British politician identified in the 
files noted by Mitrokhin as a target for KGB recruitment 
was Harold Wilson. Given the extent of his contacts with 
the Soviet Union, unusual for a Western politician in the 
early years of the Cold War, Wilson was an almost 
inevitable target. As President of the Board of Trade and 
the youngest member of the Attlee cabinet from 1947 to 
1951, Wilson had been actively involved in promoting 
East — West trade. He increased that involvement during 
Labor’s thirteen years in opposition after 1951. His 
Tribune pamphlet In Place of Dollars, published in 1952, 
urged the government to relax controls on “strategic” 
exports to the Soviet Bloc and ignore the inevitable 
American protests which would follow. In May 1953, two 



months after the death of Stalin, he became the first major 
British politician to visit Moscow since the Berlin crisis 
five years earlier. There he renewed his acquaintance with 
Anastas Mikoyan, with whom he had established friendly 
relations during visits in 1947, and held wide-ranging 
talks with the Soviet foreign minister, Vyacheslav 
Molotov. On his return to London, Wilson addressed a 
special meeting of the Parliamentary Labor Party (PLP) 
and was congratulated by Attlee on a “magnificent inside 
report” on post-Stalin Russia.^^ Wilson’s information on 
British politics seems to have been rated equally highly 
by the Russians. According to his KGB file, it was passed 
on to the Politburo.^^ There is, however, no indication 
that any of Wilson’s conversations with Soviet officials 
(some, inevitably, undercover KGB officers) was any 
more confidential than his talk to the PLP. 

During his years in opposition Wilson accepted a series 
of consultancies with firms trading with the Soviet Union, 
which paid him, on average, about 5,000 pounds a year.^^ 
According to his KGB file, one of the firms with which 
Wilson was involved breached the COCOM embargo on 
“strategic” exports. Wilson’s official biographer, Philip 
Ziegler, accepts that this was probably the case: “The 
export of many items was forbidden; inevitably a grey 
area grew up in which trading might or might not be 
illegal. Some of Wilson’s associates strayed into that area 
or even beyond it.”^^ The high value placed by the KGB 



on Wilson’s political gossip, together with the dubious 
nature of some of his business contacts, probably explain 
the Centre’s decision in 1956 to give him the codename 
OLDING and open an “agent development file” in the 
hope of recruiting him. The file records, however, that, 
“The development did not come to fruition. 

Allegations that Wilson was ever a KGB agent derive 
not from credible evidence but from unfounded 
conspiracy theories, some of them elaborated by the KGB 
officer Anatoli Golitsyn, who may have known of the 
existence of the “agent development file” and claimed 
after his defection in December 1961 that Wilson was a 
Soviet mole. When Gaitskell died suddenly in 1963, 
Golitsyn developed the bizarrely improbable theory that 
he had been poisoned by the KGB to enable Wilson to 
succeed him as Labor leader. Sadly, a minority of British 
and American intelligence officers with a penchant for 
conspiracy theory — among them James Angleton of the 
CIA and Peter Wright of MI5 — were seduced by 
Golitsyn’s fantasies.^^ Wright went on to devise several 
conspiracy theories of his own, among them the claim that 
thirty MI5 officers later conspired against Harold 
Wilson.^^ 

Far from using Wilson as an agent or confidential 
contact after he became prime minister in 1964, the 
London residency commissioned articles attacking 
various of his policies by an agent codenamed DAN, 



recruited in 1959, who contributed to the left-wing 
weekly Tribune. DAN’s file records that he published 
material given him by the KGB and wrote articles on 
“theses” devised by Service A, the active measures 
section at the Centre. Though Mitrokhin’s brief notes on 
the file do not record whether DAN received regular 
payment, they do mention that in February 1967 he was 
given a “reward” of 200 pounds. 

The most prominent British journalist targeted by the 
Centre during the early years of the Cold War to be 
identified in the KGB files noted by Mitrokhin was 
Edward Crankshaw. From the start of the Cold War until 
some years after his retirement in 1968, Crankshaw was 
Britain’s most authoritative commentator on Soviet 
affairs. During the Second World War he had served for 
two years with the British Military Mission in Russia. In 
1947 he was “half-flattered, half-bullied” by the editor of 
the Observer, David Astor, into returning to Moscow as 
the paper’s Russian and East European correspondent. For 
the next generation, he kept up what he called “a 
continual running commentary on what I thought the 
Russians were up to” in the Observer, its globally 
syndicated Foreign News Service, the New York Times 
Sunday Magazine and “lectures and broadcasts all over 
the place. Crankshaw’ s voluminous “running 
commentary,” diffused around the world, was a source of 
continuous annoyance to both the Kremlin and the Centre. 
“There is only one group of people in the world today,” 



he wrote in 1951, “which is actively and deliberately . . . 
committed to the downfall of our society: the group of 
Russians who form the government of the Soviet 
Union.”^^ 

The KGB tried various methods of bringing pressure on 
Crankshaw to modify his views — all without success. 
Some of the methods used were attempts to exploit his 
sexual liaisons in Moscow. Though “slight and 
gentlemanly in appearance,” according to his entry in the 
Dictionary of National Biography, “Crankshaw controlled 
a wild and independent nature. While serving with the 
wartime military mission, he had lived with the artist T. S. 
Andreyevskaya and her friend E. S. Rosinevich. In 1948 
both were arrested, forced to confess to being British 
spies and sent to labor camp.^^ Crankshaw was not 
intimidated, but the fate of the two women may well have 
inspired a moving description by him in 1948 of others 
who suffered similar fates: 

Another thing you become aware of in the north, and 
which dominated your ideas, is forced labor in its 
many different forms. As you sit at breakfast in your 
hotel you hear the dreadful sound of a woman 
wailing, half hysterically, in the street outside. And 
looking out you see thirty or forty women and girls 
being marched along the frozen street by guards with 
fixed bayonets, each woman with a small bundle. 

You do not know where they are going; but you 



know that they are being marched away against their 
will, that the call came suddenly and roughly, and 
that behind them they are leaving homes which are, 
as it were, still warm, while they trudge through the 
snow with nothing but their bundles. 

In 1959 photographs were taken of Crankshaw while 
engaged in what Mitrokhin’s notes describe as “sexual 
frolics. If the photographs were shown to Crankshaw, 
as was usual in such cases, he was, once again, not 
intimidated — although the episode may have helped to 
inspire his reminder in the Observer that past atrocities 
committed by the KGB remained “part of the present:” 

Still no voice in the Soviet Union can be heard to say 
that the collectivization, the mass arrests, the 
deportations and killings were appalling crimes, past 
now, but never to be forgotten, and this means in 
effect that for all the remarkable changes since 
Stalin, the Khrushchev Government is still 
condoning those crimes. 

Soon after Andropov became KGB chairman in 1967, 
he gave his approval for an operation designed either to 
blackmail Crankshaw by using the photographs taken in 
1959, and perhaps on other occasions, or to discredit him 
by sending them to the Observer. The operation, however, 
was abandoned at the urging of the London residency. 



which no doubt calculated correctly that Crankshaw 
would not give way to blackmail and that his editor would 
stand by him.^^ 

Though the photographs of Crankshaw’ s “sexual 
frolics” were never published, similar pictures were used 
in an active measure codenamed operation PROBA 
designed to discredit the Conservative MP Commander 
Anthony Courtney, who had aroused the ire of the Centre 
by campaigning against the growing size of the London 
residency. In 1965 the KGB produced a leaflet 
containing photographs of Courtney having sex with an 
unidentified woman, and circulated copies to his wife, 
other MPs and newspaper editors. Though intended to 
give the impression that Courtney was having an 
adulterous affair, the photographs had in fact been taken 
by the SCD four years earlier during a trip by Courtney, 
then a widower, to a Moscow trade fair. While in Moscow 
Courtney had been seduced by an Intourist guide who 
visited him in a hotel room fitted with a concealed KGB 
camera. The ensuing scandal, which began with a story in 
Private Eye, was largely responsible for Courtney’s 
failure to hold his seat at the 1965 general election.^^ The 
KGB file on operation PROBA also claimed the credit for 
the breakdown of Courtney’s marriage and the failure of 
his business career. 

The KGB’s main targets for sexual compromise 
operations throughout the Cold War were foreign 



embassies in Moscow. The files noted by Mitrokhin 
suggest that few, if any, embassies escaped some degree 
of penetration by KGB swallows. The most successful 
seduction within the British embassy during the Brezhnev 
era, though it achieved far less than the entrapment of 
John Vassall, was probably that of a 30-year-old married 
male diplomat codenamed KAREV, who was seduced by 
his family’s Russian maid, codenamed CH. On KGB 
instructions, using a stratagem successfully deployed 
against a number of foreign diplomats, CH pretended to 
be pregnant and sought KAREV ’s help in arranging an 
abortion, for which she claimed to have received help 
from an embassy protection officer. KAREV was 
persuaded to show his gratitude by giving some 
biographical information on embassy personnel, including 
the identities of SIS officers working under diplomatic 
cover. To compromise KAREV further, CH then 
pretended that she was pregnant again and needed help in 
arranging another abortion. Soon afterward CH was 
arrested on KGB instructions for being found in 
possession of Western currency given her by KAREV. On 
this occasion KAREV sought the help of a Soviet official, 
whom he probably realized was a KGB officer, both to 
arrange the second fictitious abortion and to have charges 
against CH dropped. Since KAREV’ s tour of duty in 
Moscow was about to end, he was persuaded to agree to a 
meeting with a KGB officer during his next posting. Once 
out of Moscow, however, KAREV succeeded in holding 



the KGB at arm’s length. On being shown his file, Philby 
advised against attempting to compromise KAREV 
publicly, as in the case of Commander Courtney, probably 
because the hand of the KGB would have been too 
obvious. 

IN BRITAIN, AS in the United States,^^ the Centre’s 
strategy during much of the Cold War was based on the 
attempt to establish a network of illegal residencies which 
would prove more difficult for MI5 to monitor than the 
legal residency at the Soviet embassy, and which could 
continue to operate if the Cold War turned into hot war. 
Its first post-war choice of illegal resident was Konon 
Trofimovich Molody (codenamed BEN), the son of two 
Soviet scientists, who seems to have been selected in 
childhood as a potential foreign intelligence officer. In 
1932, at only ten years of age, he was sent, with official 
approval, to live with an aunt in California and attend 
secondary school in San Francisco, where he became 
fluent in English before returning to Moscow in 1938. 
During the Great Patriotic War he joined the NKVD and, 
according to a stilted official hagiography, “made 
frequent sorties into the enemy’s rear . . . brilliantly 
displaying such qualities as boldness and valor.” After the 
war Molody took a degree in Chinese and worked as a 
Chinese language instructor before beginning training as 
an illegal in 1951.^^ 



Like some of the illegals chosen for postings in the 
United States, Molody began by establishing his cover in 
Canada, where he arrived in 1954 using the identity of a 
Canadian Communist “live double.” MICK, a member of 
the Central Committee of the Canadian Communist Party, 
had persuaded the Party member to give him his passport 
in the previous year when he discovered that it had never 
been used for foreign travel. Though the live double was 
told that his passport would be for Party use, MICK 
passed it to Vladimir Pavlovich Burdin of the Ottawa 
residency via a senior member of the Canadian — Soviet 
Friendship Society codenamed SVYASHCHEN-NIK 
(“Clergyman”). The Centre replaced the photograph on 
the passport with that of Molody and gave it to him for his 
journey to Canada. Once in Canada, Molody obtained a 
new passport in the name of a “dead double,” Gordon 
Arnold Lonsdale (codenamed KIZH), who had been bom 
in Cobalt, Ontario, in 1924, emigrated as a child to the 
Soviet Union with his Finnish mother and died in 1943.^^ 
A Canadian Royal Commission later concluded: 

Canada has acquired a dubious international 
reputation with regard to her passports, and there is 
evidence that hostile intelligence services have 
concentrated on the acquisition of Canadian 
documentation because of this relative ease of 
procurement.^^ 



In March 1955, Molody traveled to London using his 
new identity as “Gordon Lonsdale” and enrolled as a 
student on a Chinese course at the School of Oriental and 
African Studies (SO AS). The Centre selected SO AS for 
two main reasons. First, since the course taken by Molody 
did not lead to a degree, he was not asked to provide the 
documentation on his previous education normally 
required of British university students. Secondly, as a 
qualified lecturer in Chinese and the author of a Russian 
— Chinese textbook, Molody found little difficulty in 
coping with the course requirements while spending most 
of his time establishing the KGB’s first post-war illegal 
residency in Britain. His main problem at SOAS was the 
need to conceal from his tutors the fact that they had little, 
if anything, to teach him.^^ Molody ’s contact in the legal 
London residency was the Line N (Illegal Support) 
officer, V. A. Dmitriyev, who provided him with money 
and instructions from the Centre, as well as microdot 
letters from his family in Moscow, delivered via dead 
letter-boxes and at face-to-face meetings. “When is 
Daddy coming, and why has he gone away?” asked 
Molody’ s small son Trofim in one letter. “. . . What a 
stupid job Daddy has got.”^^ 

While at SOAS, Molody began, with the Centre’s 
approval, to establish a cover profession as a London 
businessman. Using KGB funds, he set himself up as the 
director of several companies operating juke boxes. 



vending machines and onearmed bandits. According to a 
KGB file, the vending machines included chewinggum 
dispensers at no fewer than two hundred different sites, 
thus offering Molody frequent pretexts for journeys in the 
Greater London area to meet Dmitriyev, the two other 
members of his residency and his agents. An electronic 
locking device produced by one of the firms in which 
Molody was a partner won a gold medal at the 1960 
International Inventors Exhibition in Brussels. In 
retirement, Molody made the wildly exaggerated claim 
that he had been the KGB’s first multimillionaire illegal 
resident. He boasted to a Soviet interviewer: 

Let me remind you that all the working capital and 
profits from my four companies (millions of pounds 
sterling) which were increasing year by year without 
any help from me, were “socialist property.” Strange 
but true!^^ 

The radio operators and technical support team in 
Molody’ s illegal residency were the veteran American 
agents Morris and Lona Cohen (LUIS and LESLEY, 
collectively known as the DACHNIKI), who had been 
hastily recalled to Moscow after the arrest of the 
Rosenbergs.^^ In May 1954 the Cohens were issued with 
passports in the name of Peter and Helen Kroger by a 
Soviet agent at the New Zealand consulate in Paris, Paddy 
Costello (codenamed LONG), who later became professor 



of Russian at Manchester University “Peter Kroger’s” 
cover profession in London was that of antiquarian 
bookseller. Like BEN, LUIS and LESLEY were 
extroverts with an active social life. One of their friends in 
the London book trade later recalled many convivial 
evenings at their house in Ruislip: 

Here you received good food, good wine, and the 
most wonderful hospitality . . . Peter cultivated the 
acquaintance of everyone he could, and he and his 
wife were liked by all. He attended the Bibliomites’ 
darts matches and drank pint for pint. He played for 
the Guv’nors versus the Bibs, in their annual cricket 
match, wielding his willow like a baseball bat, and 
trying to knock home runs, to everybody’s 
amusement.^^ 

George Blake, who was to meet Konon Molody while 
both were imprisoned in Wormwood Scrubs, later 
eulogized him as “a perfect example of what an ‘illegal 
resident’ should be ... a man who believes very strongly 
in an ideal and serves a great cause. During his years in 
London, however, Molody became cynical about the 
prospects of recruiting a new generation of ideological 
spies like Blake, inspired by working for a great cause. He 
later told a Soviet interviewer: 


The average Englishman is apolitical and indifferent. 



He really couldn’t care less who is governing him, 
where the country is going or whether the Common 
Market is a good or bad thing. All that interests him 
is his own wage packet, his job and keeping the wife 
happy. 

Molody also took a jaundiced view of the kind of Cold 
War recruits on whom he believed the KGB should 
concentrate in Britain: 

A good agent is one whose vital statistics are the 
following: he works, for example, in a military 
department and holds a middle-ranking but key 
position giving him access to information; he doesn’t 
aspire to a higher office, has a chip on his shoulder 
about being a failure (let’s say that ill-health 
prevented him finishing studies at the general staff 
college); he drinks (an expensive habit); he has a 
weakness for the fair sex (which is also not cheap); 
he is critical of his own government and loyal to the 
resident’s government. 

The accounts of Molody ’s career released by the KGB 
and SVR carefully conceal the fact that late in 1958 he 
was given control of the KGB’s longest- serving British 
agent, Melita Norwood (HOLA), whose ideological 
commitment seems never to have wavered over more than 
forty years. Molody met Norwood for the first time on 



December 23 and received from her the usual batch of 
documents from the safes of the Non-Ferrous Metals 
Association. For reasons not recorded in Mitrokhin’s 
notes, however, Norwood was returned only two months 
later to the control of the legal London residency. 
Perhaps Norwood was repelled by the signs of Molody’s 
highliving, womanizing lifestyle. Or perhaps Molody 
simply lacked the ability to control an ideological agent. 

The files on the Molody residency seen by Mitrokhin 
suggest that it successfully ran only two agents: Harry 
Houghton and his mistress Ethel Gee (codenamed SHAH 
and ASYA).^^ Houghton, a former NCO in the Royal 
Navy, closely resembled Molody’s jaundiced stereotype 
of the British agent. He worked as a civilian clerk in the 
Underwater Weapons Establishment at Portland, where, 
helped by Gee, who was employed as a filing clerk, he 
had easy access to top secret information on 
antisubmarine warfare and nuclear submarines. 
Houghton’s later memoirs provide striking evidence of 
how successfully his controller concealed his low opinion 
of him. Though Molody, as his Moscow interviews make 
clear, regarded agents such as Houghton as mildly 
contemptible moral inadequates, Houghton was 
pathetically convinced that, from their first meeting, 
“[tjhere was a real camaraderie between us.” Molody 
deceived Houghton so successfully that he even 
persuaded him that he regarded going to bed with any of 



his many girlfriends as “absolutely out.”^^ 

Like Blake, Houghton was identified by MI5 as a result 
of information from the defector Michal Goleniewski. 
Surveillance of Houghton led to the discovery of 
“Lonsdale,” who was then followed on a visit to the 
“Krogers” in Ruislip. A search of the “Krogers”’ house 
uncovered a powerful high-speed radio transmitter used 
for communications with the Centre and a short-wave 
radio used for receiving messages from Moscow on high- 
frequency bands, both hidden in a cavity beneath the 
kitchen floor; one-time cipher pads hidden in flashlights 
and a cigarette lighter; a microdot reader concealed in a 
box of face powder; equipment for microdot construction; 
a cookery jar containing magnetic iron oxide used for 
printing high-speed morse messages on to tape; thousands 
of pounds, dollars and travelers checks; and seven 
passports. At their trial in 1961 Molody was sentenced 
to twenty-five years in prison, the Cohens to twenty, 
Houghton and Gee to fifteen. 

Molody was freed in a spy exchange in 1964. His 
misleading memoirs, published a year later under his alias 
“Gordon Lonsdale,” with the approval of the CPSU 
Central Committee, contained a variety of disinformation 
— including the pretense that the “Krogers” were entirely 
innocent. The London residency reported a “negative 
reaction” to the memoirs by the British Communist Party 
leadership, on the grounds that they amounted to a formal 
admission that the Soviet Union engaged in espionage 



against the West.^^ In 1969 the Cohens were exchanged 
for the imprisoned British lecturer Gerald Brooke. At a 
dinner in their honor at a KGB dacha on November 25, 
1969, Andropov personally presented them with the Order 
of the Red Star. Other top brass from the Centre present at 
the dinner included Sakharovsky, the FCD chief, and 
Lazarev, the head of the illegals directorate. 5,000 roubles 
were spent furnishing a Moscow apartment for the 
Cohens on Malaya Bronnaya, where the same KGB top 
brass attended a flat- warming party in April 1970.^^ 

The Centre remained anxious, however, to keep the 
Cohens away from other Western defectors in Moscow — 
partly because it clung to the fiction that they were Polish 
and had gone to live in Poland. On June 7, 1971, while 
returning to his flat from a shopping expedition, Morris 
Cohen accidentally bumped into George Blake, whom he 
had first met several years earlier when they were both 
imprisoned in Wormwood Scrubs. The KGB file on the 
meeting notes that both expressed “genuine joy” at their 
reunion, exchanged telephone numbers and agreed to 
arrange another meeting. The Centre, however, separately 
instructed both Blake and the Cohens to devise pretexts to 
cancel their arrangement. According to the KGB record of 
a bugged telephone conversation, Cohen rang Blake to 
tell him that he was about to go on holiday and would, 
after all, not be able to meet him in the near future. Blake 
replied that he quite understood and would himself be 
leaving for his dacha in a few days’ time. The two men 



never met again. The Cohens, however, retained an 
honored place in the KGB pantheon. Lona died in 1993 at 
the age of eighty, Morris two years later at the age of 
ninety. By order of President Yeltsin, Morris Cohen was 
posthumously awarded the title of Hero of the Russian 
Federation. 

Molody’s career ended less happily. Once back in 
Moscow, his experience of life in the West made him, like 
a number of other former illegals, increasingly 
disillusioned with the Soviet system. According to Blake: 

He was particularly critical of the inefficient and 
often incompetent way Soviet industrial enterprises 
were run and international trade was conducted. 
Being an outspoken man who had the good of his 
country at heart, he made his views known. Criticism 
of any kind was not appreciated in those days and he 
soon fell from favor and found himself relegated to a 
position of relatively minor importance. 

Molody also took to drink. One Saturday in October 1970 
he went on a mushroomcollecting expedition near the 
town of Medyi with his wife and two friends from the air 
force. Immediately after his second glass of vodka, he 
suffered a stroke, lost the power of speech and died a few 
days later in hospital at the age of only forty-eight.^^ He 
lay in state on a funeral bier in the KGB officers’ club 
while colleagues displayed his large collection of medals 



on velvet cushions and Andropov and other top brass 
came to pay their respects. Shortly before his death, a 
team of writers commissioned by the Centre had 
completed, with Molody’s assistance, a new biography of 
him entitled Special Mission, some extracts of which were 
published in the Soviet press. In 1972, however, it was 
decided, with Andropov’s approval, not to publish the 
book abroad and to suspend publication in the Soviet 
Union for fear that it would “fan the flames of spymania” 
in the West.^^ 

After Molody’s death, his long-suffering wife, Galina 
Ivanovna, who had seen very little of him during his 
career as an illegal, also took to drink. Over the next few 
years she was treated several times for alcoholism. In 
1976 a monument to Molody costing 2,000 roubles was 
erected on his grave in Moscow’s Donskoy Monastery, 
next to that of another well known illegal of the 1950s, 
William Fisher (alias “Abel”). In the same year, the CPSU 
Central Committee awarded his widow a pension of 120 
roubles. 

Mitrokhin saw frequent references in KGB files to 
visits to Britain made by other Soviet illegals during the 
twenty years after Molody’s arrest but found no evidence 
that any fiilly functioning illegal KGB residency to 
replace BEN’s was established during that period — 
though it is possible that such evidence exists in files he 
did not see. One of the principal candidates chosen to 



succeed BEN in London appears to have been the 
comparatively youthful Eduard Ivanovich Koslov 
(codenamed YEVDOKI-MOV), bom in 1934. With the 
help of the agent RAG, an official in a Belgian commune, 
Koslov obtained identity documents in the name of the 
non-existent Jean-Louis de Mol, which he used to obtain a 
Belgian passport in 1961. Over the next few years, he 
went through an elaborate acclimatization period to 
strengthen his cover, studying at a Swiss foreign language 
school, working as an electronic machine operator in 
Zurich, then in a Stuttgart insurance company. In 1966 he 
returned to Belgium, took up residence in Dinant and 
obtained a new passport valid until 1970. Before he could 
move on to Britain or the United States, however, Koslov 
aroused the suspicions of the Belgian security service and 
was hurriedly recalled to Moscow. At the time of his 
recall, his account in the Banque de Bmxelles (no. A-04- 
18295) contained 39,000 Belgian francs; the Centre 
considered it too dangerous to withdraw the money and 
wrote it off. Unable henceforth to travel in the West, 
Koslov worked instead on PROGRESS operations in 
Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and the Soviet Union, 
posing as a British, American or Belgian tourist.^ ^ 

DESPITE THE APPARENT failure of its attempts to 
establish a new illegal residency after the arrest of 
Molody and the Cohens, the KGB’s British operations 
achieved a series of significant successes during the 



following decade. The Centre discovered a simple but 
effective method of making life easier for the London 
legal residency. Under four successive residents — ^Nikolai 
Grigoryevich Bagrichev (1962-4),^^ Mikhail 
Timofeyevich Chizhov (1964-6), Mikhail Ivanovich 
Lopatin (acting resident, 1966-7)^^ and Yuri Nikolayevich 
Voronin (1967-71) — the size of the residency steadily 
increased. Between 1960 and 1970, KGB and GRU 
personnel in London grew from about fifty to over 120 — 
more than in Washington or any other Western capital. 
The intelligence services of other Soviet Bloc countries 
also rapidly expanded their British operations. The aim, 
which was partially successful, was to swamp the 
overstretched MI5 with more intelligence officers than 
they could hope to keep under effective surveillance.^^ 
When the Czechoslovak StB officer Josef Frolik was 
posted to London in 1964, he was told that “the British 
service was so short of funds and men that it would be 
relatively easy to throw off their tails. MI5’s job 
became even harder at the beginning of Voronin’s term as 
resident, in 1967, when one of his operations officers, 
Aleksei Nikolayevich Savin (codenamed RUSLAN),^^ 
recruited a clerk in the Greater London Council (GLC) 
motor licensing department, Sirioj Husein Abdoolcader, 
who had access to the registration numbers of all Security 
Service and Special Branch vehicles. A series of 
sophisticated MI5 mobile surveillance operations was 



compromised by the ability of the London residency to 
identify the vehicles used.^^ 

The London residency’s greatest successes during the 
Brezhnev era were in scientific and technological 
intelligence (S&T), particularly in the defense field. In 
1967 Lopatin, the residency’s main S&T expert in the 
mid-1960s, became one of the founders of a new FCD 
Directorate T, specializing in this field and serviced by 
Line X (S&T) officers in residencies abroad. The head of 
Line X in London from the beginning of 1968 until his 
expulsion in the summer of 1971 was Lev Nikolayevich 
Sherstnev, a tough but amiable engineer who spoke 
almost flawless English with a Canadian accent and had a 
passion for Western hi-fi. 

In addition to the veteran Norwood, Mitrokhin’s notes 
identify at least ten other Line X agents active in the late 
1960s: MERCURY, a chemist recruited in 1958;^^ SAKS, 
an employee of a British aircraft company, recruited in 
Germany, probably in 1964, “for material reward;”^^^ 
YUNG, an aeronautical and computer engineer recruited 
in 1965;^^^ NAGIN, a chemical engineer recruited in 
1966;^^^ ACE, an aeronautical engineer recruited in 1967, 
who supplied voluminous documentation on aero engines 
and flight simulators; HUNT, the civil servant recruited 
by Norwood in 1967;^^^ AKHURYAN, a nuclear 
physicist recruited in 1968;^^^ STARIK, an aeronautical 
design engineer recruited in 1968;^^^ DAN, an engineer in 



the British subsidiary of an American company, recruited 
in 1969 “for material reward;” and STEP, a laboratory 
assistant recruited in 1969 for a monthly salary of 150 
dollars. Mitrokhin’s notes also identify four further 
Line X agents operating in the 1970s who may well have 
been recruited in the 1960s: a virologist, a research 
scientist in a pharmaceutical laboratory, an engineer at 
a nuclear reactor,^ and COOPER, who worked in the 
new products department of a pharmaceutical 
company. ^ ^ ^ 

MI5 was hampered in its response to the upsurge of 
KGB and GRU S&T operations not merely by its own 
overstretched resources but also by the difficulty (which it 
was, understandably, not anxious to advertise) of bringing 
successful prosecutions. Unless it could obtain 
confessions or catch agents in the act of handing over 
material, it was usually impossible to secure convictions. 
Its difficulties were exemplified by the trial in 1963 of Dr. 
Giuseppe Martelli, a 39-year-old Italian physicist 
employed for the previous year at the Culham 
Laboratories of the Atomic Energy Authority. Arrested as 
a result of a lead from a KGB defector, Martelli was 
found in possession of a record of meetings with Nikolai 
Karpekov and other KGB officers, a set of partly used 
one-time pads for cipher communications hidden inside 
an ingeniously constructed cigarette case, and instructions 
for photographing documents. But possession of 



espionage paraphernalia (unlike housebreaking 
equipment) is not in itself a crime and Martelli had no 
official access to classified information, though he was in 
contact with people who had. Martelli admitted meeting 
Karpekov, but claimed he was engaged in an ingenious 
scheme to turn the tables on a blackmail attempt by the 
KGB. He was acquitted. 

During the mid- and late 1960s there were only two 
successful British prosecutions of Soviet spies in Britain. 
In 1965 Frank Bossard, a 52-year-old projects officer at 
the Ministry of Aviation was sentenced to twenty-one 
years in jail for passing top secret details of British guided 
weapon development to the GRU. An investigation after 
Bossard’ s arrest revealed a criminal record which had 
never been properly investigated. Twenty years earlier he 
had served six months’ hard labor for fraud. In 1968 
Douglas Britten, an RAF chief technician, was also 
sentenced to twenty-one years in jail for giving the KGB 
highly classified information from RAF signals units in 
Cyprus and Lincolnshire. A Security Commission inquiry 
after Britten’s conviction disclosed Britten’s history of 
financial problems and his record as an “accomplished 
liar.”^^^ 

The work of Line X in the London residency was 
supplemented by KGB officers sent to Britain under cover 
either as members of trade and scientific delegations or as 
postgraduate students. Among the KGB postgraduates 
was A. V. Sharov of Directorate T, who began work for a 



PhD in engineering at London University in November 
1966 and was awarded his doctorate on October 22, 1969. 
On KGB instructions, Sharov returned to London to take 
his degree in person in January 1971 and embark on a 
lecture tour arranged by the Academy of Sciences which 
was intended by the Centre to enable him to identify 
possible recruits in the scientific community. 

Probably the most important Line PR postgraduate at a 
British university in the mid-1960s was Gennadi 
Fedorovich Titov (codenamed SILIN), who studied at 
University College, London. Titov went on to become 
resident in Norway in 1971 at the relatively youthful age 
of thirty-nine; in 1984 he was promoted to the rank of 
KGB general, and by the time of the 1991 coup ranked 
third in the KGB hierarchy. KGB officers and agents 
disguised as students were also used to uncover links 
between Western church groups and religious minorities 
in the Soviet Union. In September 1970 ABRAMOV (not 
identified in Mitrokhin’s notes) enrolled at a Baptist 
college in England, where he made contacts who revealed 
plans in Sweden and West Germany to smuggle religious 
literature into Russia by car, hidden in specially 
constructed secret compartments. 

Since the demise of the Magnificent Five and the arrest 
of George Blake, the Centre had seen as the main 
weakness of its British operations its failure to recruit a 
new generation of young, ideologically committed high- 



flyers. The simple truth, which the Centre could not bring 
itself to accept, was that the Soviet Union had lost most of 
its former ideological appeal. The aging apparatchiks who 
ruled Brezhnev’s Soviet Union lacked the luster of both 
the interwar myth — image of the world’s first worker — 
peasant state and the far more accurate wartime image of 
the state which had been chiefly responsible for the defeat 
of Nazism. Most young Western radicals of the late 1960s 
were attracted not to ideologically servile Communist 
Parties but to the libertarian movements of the New Left. 
Moscow, however, refused to accept that this was more 
than a passing phase. The Centre sought to use the 
exploits of Kim Philby to inspire a new generation of 
radical idealists to follow his example. 

On his defection to Moscow in 1963, Philby had been 
dismayed to discover that he held only agent status in the 
KGB, did not hold officer rank and was not even to be 
allowed to set foot inside the Lubyanka. For the first five 
years of his Moscow exile, however, he was kept 
occupied by long debriefing sessions, helping to 
ghostwrite the memoirs of Konon Molody (published 
under his alias “Gordon Lonsdale”) and writing a 
sprightly but tendentious memoir of his own career as a 
Soviet agent inside SIS, published in 1968 under the title 
of My Silent War}^^ Philby made no mention of the 
disappointments of life in Moscow. Instead, he claimed 
that, “As I look over Moscow from my study window, I 
can see the solid foundations of the future I glimpsed at 



Cambridge.” Philby concluded his preface with words 
which were intended to inspire others: 


It is a sobering thought that, but for the power of the 
Soviet Union and the Communist idea, the Old 
World, if not the whole world, would now be ruled 
by Hitler and Hirohito. It is a matter of great pride to 
me that I was invited, at so early an age, to play my 
infinitesimal part in building up that power . . . When 
the proposition [to join Soviet intelligence] was 
made to me, I did not hesitate. One does not look 
twice at an offer of enrollment in an elite force. 

Scarcely had My Silent War been published than an 
American high school student, inspired by Philby ’s 
example, arrived in Moscow on a tourist visa and offered 
his services to the KGB. Though aged only sixteen (the 
youngest Western recruit recorded in the files seen by 
Mitrokhin), he was signed up in July 1968, with 
Andropov’s personal approval, as agent SYNOK 
(“Sonny”) — the same codename as that which had 
been given to Philby on his recruitment in 1934.^^^ 
SYNOK’ s file notes that he came from a well-to-do 
family, had an idealistic commitment to the Soviet Union 
and was imbued with a romantic notion of intelligence 
work. After a second meeting with SYNOK in Mexico on 
October 19, it was decided to train him as an illegal agent. 
Over the next few months, however, either SYNOK or his 



parents had second thoughts and he failed to show up at 
the next pre-arranged rendezvous in London. 

It may be a sign of how few other bright, ideologically 

committed young Westerners were inspired to follow 

Philby’s example (no others are recorded in Mitrokhin’s 

notes) that the KGB continued intermittently to try to 

renew contact with SYNOK for more than a decade. In 

1978 a KGB officer discovered from SYNOK’ s father 

that he was in Mexico, but failed to track him down. Two 

years later, his mother was tricked into revealing that he 

was in San Francisco and giving his address. In December 

1980 the operations officer who had met him in Mexico 

twelve years earlier wrote to SYNOK in San Francisco, 

inviting him to another meeting in Mexico and giving an 

East German cover address to which to reply. When no 

reply was received, the KGB seems, at long last, to have 
121 

given up.^^^ 

Though a new generation of Philbys failed to 
materialize, memories of the Magnificent Five continued 
to enhance the prestige of the London residency. Even in 
the Gorbachev era, operations in Britain during the 
Second World War and the quarter century afterward 
were still held up as a model for young intelligence 
officers at the FCD training school, the Andropov 
Institute. The three main faculty heads in the institute had 
all made their reputations in the London residency. Yuri 
Modin, who was in charge of political intelligence 
training, was a former controller of the Magnificent Five. 



Ivan Shishkin, head of counter-intelligence, had run Line 
KR in London from 1966 to 1970. Vladimir Barkovsky, 
who ran S&T espionage training, had specialized in that 
field in London from 1941 to 1946.^^^ 

If the golden age of KGB operations in London had 
ended with the demise of the Magnificent Five in 1951, 
the silver age came to an even more abrupt conclusion 
twenty years later with the defection of Oleg Lyalin and 
the mass expulsion of 105 KGB and GRU officers. 
Henceforth MI5 surveillance was no longer swamped by 
the sheer numbers of Soviet intelligence personnel. Oleg 
Gordlevsky remembers the British operation FOOT as “a 
bombshell, an earthquake of an expulsion, without 
precedent, an event that shocked the Centre 
profoundly.”^^^ According to Oleg Kalugin, “our 
intelligence gathering activities in England suffered a 
blow from which they never recovered.”^^^ For the 
remainder of the Cold War the KGB probably found it 
more difficult to collect high-grade intelligence in London 
than in almost any other Western capital.

BRITAIN 


Part 2: After Operation FOOT 


Despite Moscow’s public expressions of righteous 
indignation after the expulsion of 105 KGB and GRU 
officers from London in September 1971, the Centre 
knew that it had suffered a public relations disaster. The 
centerpiece of its active measures campaign to turn the 
tables on British intelligence and discredit the British 
expulsions was the former rising star of SIS, Kim Philby. 
Philby, however, was in no fit state to be seen in public. 
Since the publication of his memoirs in 1968, the KGB 
seemed to have no further use for him and Philby roamed 
round Russia on a series of almost suicidal drinking bouts 
which sometimes left him oblivious of where he was, 
uncertain whether it was night or day. During the early 



1970s he was slowly pulled back from alcoholic oblivion 
by Rufa, “the woman I had been waiting for all my life.”^ 
Though the Centre judged, no doubt correctly, after 
operation FOOT that Philby was still in no condition to 
give a press conference, it used a lengthy interview with 
him in Izvestia on October 1, 1971 to denounce the 
“slanderous allegations” in the “right-wing bourgeois 
British press” that the Soviet officials expelled from 
London had been engaged in espionage. In striking 
contrast with the far more sophisticated tone of Philby ’s 
memoirs published three years earlier, the interview 
regurgitates a series of stereotypical denunciations of 
British “ruling circles:” 

It should be said that spy mania, the fabrication of 
slanderous inventions in regard to the Soviet Union, 
is nothing new in the activities of the ruling circles in 
England. Definite, concrete political aims are always 
behind such activities. 

This time also, the intensive anti-Soviet 
provocation and the large scale of the false 
accusations in regard to Soviet officials in London, 
as well as the timing of this action, reveal the 
premeditated character of the activities of the 
Conservatives who now hold power. 

These activities are directed at putting the brakes 
on the process of lessening tension in Europe. 

It is no accident that, as was reflected in the 



English bourgeois press, government circles showed 
evident displeasure at, and I should say fear of, the 
foreign policy of the Soviet Union, which is directed 
towards normalization of the international situation. 

Philby can scarcely have composed these turgid platitudes 
himself. The probability is that they were simply 
submitted to him by the KGB for signature. Philby added 
to them some personal memories of the anti-Soviet 
“psychological warfare” conducted by British intelligence 
— though there was a certain irony to his claim that “SIS 
did not interrupt their subversive operations against the 
Soviet Union even at the time of the war against Hitler’s 
Germany.”^ In reality, the lack of evidence of anti-Soviet 
subversion in the wartime SIS reports provided by Philby 
had led the Centre to suspect him of disinformation.^ The 
fact that Philby identified SIS officers, real and alleged, 
who had been stationed in the Middle East since he had 
defected from Beirut in 1963 is further evidence that 
much, if not ah, of his interview was scripted for him by 
the Centre.^ Among the British intelligence officers in 
Beirut identified in his interview was the young David 
Spedding who, a quarter of a century later, became chief 
ofSIS.^ 

So, far from limiting the damage done by the London 
expulsions, Philby’ s interview turned into another public 
relations fiasco. Tass was promptly sued for libel by four 



prominent Lebanese citizens named in the interview as 
British agents: Robert Abella, editor-publisher of the 
Beirut weekly Al Zaman; Dori Chamoun, son of former 
President Camille Chamoun; Emir Farid Chehab, former 
Lebanese security chief; and Ahmed Isbir, a deputy in the 
Lebanese parliament.^ The Soviet ambassador in Beirut 
sought to distance his government from the law suit by 
declaring that the whole affair was “purely journalistic” 
and that “the Soviet Union as a state had no connection 
with it.” He quickly backtracked, however, when the head 
of the Tass bureau in Beirut, Nikolai Borisovich Filatov, 
was included in the law suit, claiming that Tass was “a 
government news agency” and that Filatov was covered 
by diplomatic immunity.^ To make matters worse, the 
Communist lawyer chosen by the embassy to act for Tass 
was believed by the Centre to be an SIS agent. ^ Before 
the case came to trial the Beirut residency withdrew 
Filatov and his family to Moscow.^ In May 1972 the Tass 
Lebanese bureau chief, Raymond Saadeh, who was 
unable to claim diplomatic immunity, was sentenced to 
two months’ imprisonment and ordered to pay damages of 
40,000 Lebanese pounds to each of the plaintiffs — a 
sentence later reduced on appeal to a fine of 1,000 and 
damages of 10,000 Lebanese pounds each (a total of 
about 6,000 pounds sterling). Tass was further humiliated 
by being ordered to report the judgment against it. The 
story appeared in The Times under the headline, “Tass 



ordered to pay for libel by Mr. Kim Philby.”^^ 

The miserable sequel to Philby’s Izvestia interview did 
little either to persuade Philby that the KGB any longer 
had a serious use for his talents or to assist in his 
rehabilitation. When Oleg Kalugin met him for the first 
time at the beginning of 1972, a month after Philby’s 
marriage to Rufa, he found “a wreck of a man:” 

The bent figure caromed off the walls as he walked. 

Reeking of vodka, he mumbled something 

unintelligible to me in atrocious, slurred Russian. 

Over the next few years Kalugin and other Young Turks 
within the FCD gradually succeeded in rehabilitating 
Philby, using him to devise active measures and run 
seminars for young officers about to be posted to Britain, 
Ireland, Australasia and Scandinavia. Kryuchkov and the 
FCD old guard, however, remained suspicious of Philby 
and refused to allow him into Yasenevo.^^ Philby’s lack 
of status continued to rankle with him. He liked to give 
Western journalists the impression that he was Colonel — 
or even General — Philby of the KGB. In reality, he 
remained agent TOM. 

IN THE IMMEDIATE aftermath of the mass expulsions 
of September 1971, most of the London residency’s 
agents were put on ice. The Centre calculated that the 
residency would be unlikely to resume normal operations. 



even on a reduced scale, until mid- 1974 at the earliest. 

The much reduced number of KGB and GRU officers 
in London found themselves under considerably tighter 
surveillance. On September 17, 1971, Abdoolcader, the 
KGB agent in the GLC motor licensing department, was 
arrested after a tip-off from Lyalin, who had been his case 
officer for the previous two years. In his wallet was a 
postcard addressed to Lyalin, giving the latest registration 
numbers of MI5 surveillance vehicles. Abdoolcader was 
jailed for three years. 

With the previous resident, Voronin, declared persona 

non grata and known intelligence officers refused British 

visas, a junior Line KR officer, Yevgeni Ivanovich 

Lazebny, who had the cover position of security officer at 

the Soviet trade delegation and had somehow escaped 

expulsion, was made acting resident. During his fourteen 

months in charge, Lazebny tried to preserve his cover by 

keeping his office at the trade delegation and visiting the 

embassy each day to supervise the work of the residency. 
14 

Though out of his depth when it came to running 
intelligence operations, Lazebny insisted on elaborate and 
time-consuming security precautions which further 
complicated the life of the residency. No one was allowed 
to enter the residency wearing an overcoat for fear that it 
might be used to conceal material being smuggled in or 
out. Briefcases, bags and packages were also forbidden, 
and the shoes of operations officers were X-rayed for 



bugs or any hidden compartments. All mail and furniture 
bought or repaired locally were also X-rayed. The 
embassy administrative officer, M. V. Loshkarov, was 
disciplined for placing a bulk order at a London store for 
electric lamps which Lazebny feared might be bugged. 
Oil cans, batteries, even knots in woodwork, were 
regularly inspected to make sure they contained no bugs 
or secret compartments.^^ 

At the end of 1972 Lazebny was succeeded as resident 
by the Latvian Yakov Konstantinovich Lukasevics (alias 
“Bukashev”),^^ who continued to insist on elaborate 
security procedures. In 1971-2 the residency received 
agent reports that MI5 had a source either among the 
officials of the Soviet trade delegation or among the 
inspectors of industrial equipment. Though a time- 
consuming hunt for the traitor continued until 1976, it 
yielded no result. It was eventually concluded that the 
agent reports might have been planted by MI5 to distract 
the residency from its operational priorities. The 
residency’s fears of British penetration had, however, 
some foundation. An extensive network of bugging 
devices was discovered at the trade delegation, which 
contained outposts of both the KGB and GRU 
residencies.^^ 

Following the 1971 expulsions, Cuban and east 
European intelligence services were asked by the Centre 
to help plug the intelligence gap in London. The KGB 



also sought to compensate in some degree for its 
diminished residency by expanding its agent network 
among the diplomats and staff of the London embassy. By 
1973 nineteen members of the embassy were listed in 
Centre files as KGB agents, among them the 
ambassador’s deputy, Ivan Ippolitov.^^ Some of the KGB 
officers who were expelled from, or denied entry to, 
Britain, were redeployed to Commonwealth capitals with 
substantial British expatriate communities — notably 
Delhi, Colombo, Dar-es-Salaam, Lagos and Lusaka.^^ 
The files seen by Mitrokhin record few major 
recruitments of British agents by the redeployed officers. 
In 1974, however, three operations officers in an east 
African residency — S. S. Sarmanov, G. M. Yermolev and 
N. T. Krestnikov — ^were given awards for recruiting a 
British journalist, TOM, and his wife IRENE. TOM and 
IRENE, however, proved of limited usefulness. Early in 
1976 TOM moved to Asia and was briefly used to report 
on other Western residents. He failed, however, to gain 
access to any classified information and in April 1976 
Kryuchkov decided to break operational contact with 
him.^^ 

THE FIRST SECTION of the London residency to 
resume something like normal operations after the 1971 
expulsions, albeit slowly and on a reduced scale, was Line 
X (S&T). During 1972 plans were made to renew contact 



with six of its most highly rated agents: the veteran Melita 
Norwood (HOLA) in the British Non-Ferrous Metals 
Association, first recruited in 1937; ACE, an aeronautical 
engineer; HUNT, a civil servant recruited by Norwood; 
YUNG, an aeronautics and computer engineer; NAGIN, a 
chemical engineer; and STEP, a laboratory assistant.^^ 
Though Mitrokhin’s notes give only an incomplete 
account of how the six agents were reactivated, it is clear 
that it was a lengthy business, probably preceded by 
prolonged and painstaking surveillance to ensure that 
none was under MI5 observation. Contact with HUNT 
was not re-established until 1975, and even then it was 
thought safer to use a French agent, MAIRE, rather than 
an operations officer from the London residency, as his 
controller.^^ 

When contact was renewed with Melita Norwood in 
London in 1974, it was discovered that she had retired 
two years earlier. Since she no longer had access to 
classified material, regular contact was discontinued. 
HOLA, however, retained a high reputation in the Centre 
as probably its longest- serving British agent with a highly 
productive record which included intelligence on the 
British nuclear program. She seems to have remained 
throughout her career a true believer in the Soviet Union. 
During a visit to Moscow with her husband in 1979, 
forty-two years after her original recruitment, she was 
offered a further financial reward but declined, saying she 



had all she needed to live on.^^ 

By 1974 Line X at the London residency had nine 
operations officers (seven fewer than before operation 
FOOT), headed by the deputy resident, Oleg 
Aleksandrovich Yakimov, and had successfully resumed 
contact with most of the Line X agents put on ice in 
September 1971.^^ The most productive of the reactivated 
agents was, almost certainly, the aeronautical engineer 
ACE, recruited in the late 1960s.^^ By the time he died in 
the early 1980s, ACE’s product file consisted of about 
300 volumes, each of about 300 pages. Most of these 
90,000 pages consisted of technical documentation on 
new aircraft (among them Concorde, the Super VC- 10 
and Lockheed L-1011), aero-engines (including Rolls- 
Royce, Olympus-593, RB-211 and SNEY-505) and flight 
simulators. ACE’s material on the flight simulators for the 
Lockheed L-1011 and Boeing 747 were the foundation for 
a new generation of Soviet equivalents. ACE also 
recruited under false flag (probably that of a rival 
company) an aero-engine specialist codenamed SWEDE. 
Remarkably, ACE was paid a monthly salary of only 225 
pounds, raised to 350 pounds in 1980.^^ 

Despite the exclusion from Britain of known KGB and 
GRU officers, the KGB was still able to send Line X 
agents and “trusted contacts” from Soviet universities to 
Britain on scientific exchanges and for postgraduate or 
postdoctoral research in engineering and the natural 



sciences. Most went either to universities and 
polytechnics in the London area or to Oxford and 
Cambridge.^^ “Targets of operational interest,” where it 
was hoped that KGB agents and trusted contacts could 
identify potential recruits, included Churchill College, 
King’s College, St. Catharine’s College and Trinity Hall 
at Cambridge University; Magdalen, Queen’s and Trinity 
Colleges at Oxford; King’s College, University College, 
the London School of Economics, the School of Oriental 
and African Studies and the School of Slavonic Studies at 
London University.^^ 

Some of the Soviet scientists who came to conduct 
research in Britain were KGB officers. In May 1975, for 
example. Dr. Hugh Huxley of the British Medical 
Research Council’s molecular biology laboratory at 
Cambridge invited Academician Frank, director of the 
USSR Academy of Sciences Biophysics Institute, to send 
a member of his institute to carry out research at the 
laboratory. Unknown to Huxley, the invitation was 
misappropriated by the KGB. The scientist sent to 
Cambridge was Valeri Vasilyevich Lednev of Directorate 
T.^^ At about the time Lednev embarked on his British 
assignment, the head of Directorate T, Mikhail Lopatin, 
who had been in charge of S&T collection in Britain in 
the mid-1960s, arrived in London to advise the residency 
on the expansion of Line X operations.^ ^ 

Though not comprehensive, Mitrokhin’s notes suggest 



that there were fewer new British Line X recruits during 
the 1970s than in the decade before operation FOOT. The 
earliest post-FOOT recruit definitely identified by 
Mitrokhin is CHRISTINA, who was recruited in 1973 — 
probably in the Soviet Union.^^ It is unclear from 
Mitrokhin’ s notes whether four other Line X agents 
operating in Britain in the early 1970s were recruited 
before or after the mass expulsion of KGB and GRU 
officers. Because of the difficult operating conditions in 
London, at least six (probably more) Line X agents either 
met their case officers outside Britain or were controlled 
by other European residencies.^^ 

The most important British S&T agent recruited during 
the decade after operation FOOT was, almost certainly, 
Michael John Smith (codenamed BORG), a Communist 
electronics engineer.^^ The secretary of the Surrey 
Communist Party in the early 1970s, Richard Geldart, 
recalls Smith as an “out-and-out Tankie” — a hardline 
supporter of the crushing of the Prague Spring by Soviet 
tanks: “Not to put too fine a point on it, he was the total 
nerd. There was socializing going on, but he was not part 
of it.”^^ A Line X officer at the London residency, Viktor 
Alekseevich Oshchenko (codenamed OZEROV), made 
initial contact with Smith in a pub near Smith’s flat at 
Kingston-on-Thames after a trade union meeting held in 
May 1975 before the referendum on British membership 
of the EEC. On instructions from Oshchenko, Smith left 



the Communist Party, ceased trade union activity, became 
a regular reader of the Daily Telegraph, joined a local 
tennis club and — as his operational file quaintly puts it 
— “endeavored to display his loyalty to the authorities.” 

In July 1976, helped by bureaucratic confusion in MI5, 
caused by the remarkable coincidence that the Surrey 
Communist Party contained another Michael John Smith, 
he gained a job as a test engineer in the quality assurance 
department of Thom — EMI Defense Electronics at 
Feltham, Middlesex. Within a year he was working on the 
top secret project XN-715, developing and testing radar 
fuses for Britain’s freefall nuclear bomb.^^ The KGB 
passed the documents on project XN-715 provided by 
Smith to N. V. Serebrov and other nuclear weapons 
specialists at a secret Soviet military research institute 
codenamed Enterprise G-4598, who succeeded in 
building a replica of the British radar fuse. Smith’s 
intelligence, however, seemed too good to be tme. 
Serebrov and his colleagues were puzzled as to how 
Smith had been able to obtain the radio frequency on 
which the detonator was to operate. This information, 
they believed, was so sensitive that it should not have 
appeared even in the top secret documents on the design 
and operation of the detonator to which Smith had access. 
Armed with a knowledge of the radio frequency, Soviet 
forces would be able to create radio interference which 
could prevent the detonator from operating. One 
possibility which occurred to the specialists was that the 



frequency supplied by Smith might be merely a test 
frequency which would not be used in actual military 
operations. But they remained suspicious of the extent of 
the detailed highly classified information which Smith 
had been able to supply. 

The Centre also seems to have been suspicious of the 
ease and speed with which a well-known pro- Soviet 
Communist had been able to gain access to one of 
Britain’s most highly classified nuclear secrets so soon 
after going through the motions of leaving the Party and 
switching from the Morning Star to the Daily Telegraph. 
Its suspicions that Smith’s intelligence on the radar fuse 
might have been a sophisticated deception seem to have 
strengthened when he told his controller in 1978 that he 
had lost his security clearance and, for the time being, 
could no longer provide classified information. (Though 
Smith did not realize it at the time, MI5 had discovered its 
earlier error and secretly informed Thom- EMI of Smith’s 
Communist past.)^^ 

To try to resolve its doubts the Centre devised a series 
of tests to check Smith’s reliability. The first test, which 
Smith seems to have passed, was to remove two packets 
of secret material from a dead letter-box in Spain. The 
second, more elaborate check on Smith, personally 
approved by Andropov and termed in KGB jargon “a 
psycho-physiological test using a non-contact polygraph,” 
was conducted in Vienna in August 1979 by Boris 
Konstantinovich Stalnov and two OT (operational — 



technical support) officers. Stalnov began with a brief 
prepared speech, duly entered in Smith’s file: 

I am personally satisfied with the way things are 
going and with our mutual relations and I am 
therefore extremely glad to congratulate you. From 
today you are a full member of our organization. 

This means that the organization will take care of 
you. Believe me, you will have gained friends who 
are ready to come to your help in any circumstances. 
Your participation and help to the organization will 
be duly recognized. The organization is based on two 
principles: voluntary participation and sincerity. 

The first means that, having joined the 
organization of your own free will, you may leave it 
at any time if you think it necessary, without any 
[adverse] consequences for yourself, provided you 
give prior notice. 

As for the second principle, sincerity, you must 
inform us of all details which directly or indirectly 
affect the interests of our organization. This is 
understandable as the security of both sides depends 
on it. Joining the organization is also in a certain 
sense a formal act. In connection with this I am 
required to put a number of questions to you. I 
regard this as a pure formality. You should do the 
same. 

It will simplify the task and save time if you 



simply answer “yes” or “no.” 


Smith was then asked over 120 questions and his replies 
secretly recorded. Subsequent analysis of the recording 
and Smith’s response to each question persuaded the 
Centre — doubtless to its immense relief — that he was not, 
as it had thought possible, engaged in a grand deception 
orchestrated by British intelligence. Though Smith had 
been led to suppose that the “psycho-physiological test” 
was a routine formality, it had never been used before by 
the KGB outside the Soviet Union. The Centre was so 
pleased with its success that it decided to use the same 
method to check other agents. It none the less decided to 
give Smith a third (and apparently final) test of his 
“sincerity” by instructing him to remove a container 
holding two rolls of film from a DLB in the Paris suburbs 
and to deliver it to a KGB officer in Lisbon.^^ The KGB 
would doubtless have been able to detect any attempt by 
Smith or another intelligence agency to open the 
container. 

From 1979 onward Smith was paid a 300-pound 
monthly retainer by the KGB. His file also records 
additional payments for documents supplied by him of 
1,600 pounds, 750 pounds, 400 pounds and 2,000 pounds. 
Though Mitrokhin’s notes do not record the dates of these 
payments, they probably relate chiefly to Smith’s two 
years in Thom — EMI Defense Electronics.^^ The 
excitement of working for the KGB, copying highly 



classified documents, emptying DLBs and going to secret 
assignations with his case officers in foreign capitals 
seems to have rescued Smith from his earlier existence as 
a “total nerd.” A hint of the exotic began to enliven a 
previously drab lifestyle. In 1979 he got married, took up 
flamenco dancing, began experimenting with Spanish and 
Mexican cuisine, and gave dinner parties at which guests 
were served his homemade wine.^^ 

Smith was so taken with his life as a secret agent that 
he made strenuous efforts to recover the security 
clearance he had lost in 1978, even drafting a personal 
appeal two years later to Margaret Thatcher to intercede 
on his behalf. “There is a cloud over me which I cannot 
dispel,” he complained to the Prime Minister. “I have 
been wrongly suspected and have lost my position most 
unjustly.” Though Smith seems never to have posted his 
letter to Mrs. Thatcher, in June 1980 he succeeded in 
putting his case to an MI5 officer. Smith began by 
denying that he had ever been a Communist, was 
confronted with evidence that he had, then apologized for 
lying and said he had joined the Party only to find a 
girlfriend.^^ Amazingly, Smith’s campaign to recover his 
security clearance survived even this setback. More 
amazingly still, a few years later it succeeded.^^ 

In 1980 7.5 percent of all Soviet scientific and 
technological intelligence came from British sources. 
As well as providing what it claimed was enormous 



assistance to Soviet research and development, especially 
in the military field, Directorate T also prided itself on 
obtaining commercial secrets which drove down the cost 
of contracts with Western companies. One British 
example of which it was particularly proud during the 
later 1970s was the negotiation of the contract for two 
large methane production plants with the companies Davy 
Power Gas and Klickner INA Industrial Plants. The 
original price quoted by the British consortium was 248 
million convertible roubles, as compared with the 206 
million allocated for the project by the Soviet Council of 
Ministers. An operation conducted in the Peking Hotel, 
Moscow, on March 23, 1977 by Directorate T with the 
assistance of the Moscow KGB, probably based on a 
combination of eavesdropping and the secret 
photocopying of company documents, obtained 
commercial intelligence which — according to a report by 
the Ministry of Foreign Trade — made it possible to 
negotiate a reduction of 50.6 million roubles on the price 
of the contract. On October 24, 1977 Andropov formally 
commended fifteen KGB officers for their part in the 
operation. Ironically, the British prime minister, James 
Callaghan, subsequently wrote to his Soviet opposite 
number, Alexei Kosygin, to thank the Soviet government 
for awarding the contract to a British firm.^^ 

THE PR AND KR Lines at the London residency appear 
to have had less success during the 1970s than Line X. 



The only known Soviet agent within the British 
intelligence community, Geoffrey Prime of GCHQ, was 
run not by the residency but by Third Directorate 
controllers who met him outside Britain.^^ The most 
highly placed Line PR agent active during the decade 
after operation FOOT identified in Mitrokhin’s notes was 
WILLIAM, a trade union official and former Communist. 
WILLIAM was recruited during a visit to the Soviet 
Union by Boris Vasilyevich Denisov, a KGB officer 
working under cover as a Soviet trade union (AUCCTU) 
official, and agreed to provide inside information on the 
TUC and the Labor Party. After a meeting with 
WILLIAM in London in December 1975, however, his 
case officer reported that he had become anxious about 
his role as a Soviet agent. Though reaffirming his desire 
to help his Soviet comrades, WILLIAM said that he was 
distrusted by less progressive trade union officials 
because of his Marxist views and worried that word of his 
Soviet connection would leak out and damage his chances 
of becoming leader of his union.^^ Lacking any really 
important British agents. Line PR tended to exaggerate 
the significance of second-rate agents such as WILLIAM 
and its other sources of inside information on British 
politics and government policy. 

The political contact of which Line PR was proudest 
was Harold Wilson (codenamed OLDING), who became 
president of the Great Britain — ^USSR Association after 
his resignation as prime minister in 1976. The first 



secretary at the Soviet embassy responsible for liaison 
with the association, Andrei Sergeyevich Parastayev, 
periodically called on Wilson, nominally to discuss its 
affairs with him. The fact that Parastayev was a KGB 
agent allowed the residency to claim that it had secured 
access to the former prime minister. Though not claiming 
that Wilson was a “confidential contact” (let alone an 
agent), the residency reported that he freely provided 
political information.^^ Mitrokhin’s notes give no 
examples of what the information comprised, but if 
Wilson’s observations to Parastayev resembled his private 
comments to some of his British friends and 
acquaintances, they would certainly have attracted the 
attention of the Centre and probably have been passed to 
the Politburo. Roy Jenkins noted in 1978, for example, 
that Wilson “did not think there was much future for the 
[Callaghan] Government, or indeed the Labor Party. 

The Centre claimed that disinformation from Service A 
had been passed to Wilson, probably via Parastayev, with 
the intention that it should reach the Labor government. 

It is highly unlikely, however, that the disinformation had 
any significant influence on Wilson, let alone on the 
Callaghan government. In retirement, though remaining 
firmly anchored in the Labor Party, Wilson moved 
steadily to the right. According to his official biographer, 
Philip Ziegler, by 1977 his dislike of the far left equaled 
that of “the most conservative of capitalists.”^^ Nor did 



Wilson show great sympathy for Soviet foreign policy. 
His KGB file reports that, after the invasion of 
Afghanistan, he canceled a visit to the USSR in his 
capacity as president of the Great Britain — ^USSR 
Association.^^ 

By the 1970s Line PR in London, as in other 
residencies, was supposed to spend 25 percent of its time 
on active measures^^ and send annual statistics to the 
Centre on the number of its influence operations. These 
totaled 160 in 1976 and 190 in 1977.^^ During 1977 Line 
PR officers reported that they had initiated 99 discussions 
which allegedly “influenced” politicians, journalists and 
other opinion-formers, and claimed to have successfully 
prompted 26 public announcements, 20 publications, the 
sending of more than 20 letters and telegrams, 9 questions 
in Parliament, 5 press conferences, 4 meetings and 
demonstrations and 3 television and radio broadcasts. In 
addition, it had distributed three brochures and one forged 
document produced by Service A, which was responsible 
for active measures at the Centre. 

In order to gain credit from the Centre, residencies 
invariably tried to exaggerate the success of their active 
measures. While working at the Centre, Oleg Gordlevsky 
was told that in 1977 or 1978 the London resident, Yakov 
Lukasevics, had been asked by Andropov whether his 
residency possessed the means to influence British policy. 
“Why yes, we can exert influence,” Lukasevics replied. 



“We have such channels.” “I do not think you can,” 
Andropov told him. “I think you are too hasty in 
answering that question.”^^ The files noted by Mitrokhin 
confirm Andropov’s skepticism. 

The KGB’s attempts to recruit agents of influence in 
the British media to use for active measures seems to have 
met with limited success by comparison with France and 
some other European countries. The journalist DAN, 
probably the London residency’s most reliable agent of 
influence during the 1960s,^^ broke contact during the 
1970s — ^probably after he was put on ice in the aftermath 
of operation FOOT. Several attempts by the residency to 
reactivate DAN failed and he was eventually written off 
some time in the early 1980s.^^ 

Probably the most ambitious scheme devised by the 
London residency during the 1970s for the recruitment of 
a prominent agent of influence was targeted on Dr. 
Mervyn Stockwood, the socialist Bishop of Southwark.^ ^ 
In October 1975 Stockwood delivered a public protest 
against a “Call to the Nation,” jointly issued by 
Archbishop Donald Coggan of Canterbury and 
Archbishop Stuart Blanch of York, claiming that it put too 
much emphasis on the need for individual responsibility 
and too little on the social injustices which caused so 
much human misery. The most remarkable feature of 
Stockwood’ s protest, however, was that he chose to make 
it in the pages of the Communist Morning Star, and that 



he included in it an extraordinary tribute to the Soviet 
Bloc: 

Those of us who have visited Socialist counties in 
Europe know that if a Communist government were 
to be established in Britain the West End would be 
cleared up overnight, and the ugly features of our 
permissive society would be changed within a matter 
of days. And heaven help the pom merchants and all 
engaged in the making of fortunes through the 
commercial exploitation of sex.^^ 

Sixteen Labor MPs signed a motion “marveling at the 
innocence” of Stockwood’s understanding of Communist 
regimes. Another fifty backbenchers supported a motion 
supporting the archbishops against his criticisms. One told 
the Guardian, “The Marxists seem now to have 
penetrated the higher echelons of the established 
Church.”^^ The Soviet embassy, possibly on the initiative 
of the residency, established what a KGB file describes as 
“close contact” with Stockwood. 

Hopes in the residency of the bishop’s potential for 
active measures reached their peak when he arranged a 
dinner party with Gordon McLennan, general secretary of 
the British Communist Party, as guest of honor, to which, 
apparently, at least one Soviet official (who, unknown to 
Stockwood, was a KGB officer) was also invited. 
Though Mitrokhin’s note on the dinner is tantalizingly 



brief, it seems to have been a boisterous evening. 
Stockwood frequently drank heavily at dinner parties to 
the extent that his friend Princess Margaret sometimes 
feared for the furniture at Kensington Palace. Over 
dinner Stockwood asked McLennan what the Communist 
Party thought about the Church of England. McLennan 
replied that the Church was a “moral force in society,” but 
regretted that, “Unlike before and during the War, we do 
not see members of the clergy at progressive meetings 
and demonstrations.” Stockwood retorted, “We also don’t 
see you at demonstrations at the Soviet embassy The 
residency seems to have concluded reluctantly that the 
Bishop’s tendency to launch into criticisms of the Soviet 
Union rendered him unsuitable for active measures. 

THE EXAMPLES OF active measures noted by 
Mitrokhin suggest that the residency, in its reports to the 
Centre, sought to inflate a series of mostly modest 
successes. A characteristic example was its attempt to 
claim the credit for an article in the Guardian by Richard 
Gott (codenamed RON) attacking the role of the CIA in 
the overthrow of the Marxist president of Chile, Salvador 
Allende, in 1973, and denouncing the military junta of 
General Augusto Pinochet which had seized power after 
Allende’ s death.^^ Gott later denied reports that he had 
been a KGB agent, but acknowledged that after the 
Chilean coup he had been contacted by Yuri Mikhailovich 
Solonitsyn (who he later realized was a KGB officer) and 



had “quite a sort of interesting session” with him on 
Chile, as well as a series of subsequent meetings with 
both Solonitsyn and Igor Victorovich Titov (also a KGB 
officer). While the details of Gotfs articles may 
sometimes have been influenced by “interesting sessions” 
with Solonitsyn and Titov, his support for revolutionary 
movements in Latin America and loathing for American 
“imperialism” were so well established that he would 
have required little encouragement from the KGB to 
denounce either Pinochet or the CIA.^^ 

The London residency was equally prone to exaggerate 
its influence in the House of Commons. It tried to take the 
credit, for example, for the following parliamentary 
question put by the Labor MP James Lamond to Fred 
Mulley, Secretary of State for Defense in the Callaghan 
government, on February 21, 1978: 

Does my right honorable friend agree that to deploy 
the neutron bomb in western Europe must lower the 
threshold of nuclear war? Does he accept that 
President Brezhnev was in earnest when he said in 
the Kremlin [Conservative shouts o/“Were you 
there?”] that the Soviet Union would develop similar 
weapons at enormous cost, if the neutron bomb were 
placed in western Europe? That would be a cost that 
neither the Warsaw Pact nor NATO could afford and 
would serve only unnecessarily to increase the 
enormous arms expenditure of the world. 



There is absolutely no evidence that James Lamond had 
any conscious link with the KGB. He was, however, vice- 
president of the World Peace Council (WPC) and appears 
not to have realized that this was the leading Soviet front 
organization, devoted to pinning all the blame for the 
nuclear arms race on Western warmongering. 
Lamond ’s parliamentary question, which received a 
noncommittal reply, derived from a much larger WPC 
campaign against the neutron bomb rather than from a 
brilliant initiative by the London residency. 

The Centre usually responded relatively uncritically to 
exaggerated claims by residencies of the success of their 
active measures. It suited the Centre as much as the 
London residency to be able to inform the Politburo that it 
was able to inspire questions in the House of Commons 
and articles in the Guardian. 

Despite Line PR’s attempts to inflate the importance of 
its active measures, it also had some undoubted successes. 
The Observer and the New Statesman were among a 
number of British print media taken in during the early 
1980s by forged anti-American and anti-South African 
documents fabricated by Service A.^^ The Observer 
printed a bogus memorandum from the Zaire security 
council under the headline, “US and S. Africa in Angola 
Plot.”^^ The New Statesman published a forged letter 
from South African military intelligence to Jeane 
Kirkpatrick, US ambassador to the UN, conveying its 



“gratitude” and referring to a birthday present sent to her 
“as a token of appreciation.”^^ As late as 1986, the 
conservative Sunday Express based its main front page 
story on reports (also concocted by Service A) that the 
AIDS vims had originally been developed as part of an 
American biological warfare program. Claims that KGB 
active measures had succeeded in producing significant 
shifts in British opinion, however, were based on little 
more than wishful thinking. 

The KGB’s shortage of major agents in the British 
media helps to explain why it chose a Danish rather than a 
British journalist, Ame Herlov Petersen (codenamed 
KHARLEV and PALLE) for its first major active 
measure against Margaret Thatcher after she became 
prime minister in 1979. Originally a confidential contact 
of the Copenhagen residency, Petersen had been invited 
to Moscow in the mid-1970s to “deepen the 
relationship.”^^ Thereafter he was regularly used as an 
agent of influence not merely to write articles along lines 
suggested by his case officers but to publish, also under 
his own name, articles and pamphlets written in English 
by Service A. The first of the KGB/Petersen co- 
productions attacking Thatcher was a 1979 pamphlet, 
entitled Cold Warriors, which gave her pride of place as 
Europe’s leading anti-Soviet cmsader. The next Petersen 
pamphlet ghostwritten by Service A, True Blues, 
published in 1980, was solely devoted to an onslaught on 



Thatcher. It made the mistake of attempting satire — a 
weak area of the KGB’s usually heavy-handed active 
measures — and carried the feeble subtitle “The Thatcher 
that Couldn’t Mend her own Roof.” The Service A author 
had an even feebler grasp of English geography, believing 
Mrs. Thatcher’s birthplace of Grantham in Lincolnshire to 
be “in the suburbs of London.” Though the Centre 
appears to have been curiously proud of them, both 
pamphlets (probably intended chiefly for mailing to 
British “opinion-formers”) had negligible influence. 

THOUGH MITROKHIN HAD unrestricted access to 
LCD files, their sheer volume meant that his notes on 
them are bound to contain significant gaps. The 
possibility thus remains that the KGB had important Cold 
War British sources not identified by him. It is unlikely, 
however, that there were many of them. Oleg Gordlevsky 
has confirmed that during his posting to the London 
residency from 1982 to 1985, which included two years as 
head of Line PR and a few months as resident-designate. 
Line PR and, probably. Line KR were running no British 
agents of major importance. There remains the 
possibility of British agents recruited and run by 
residencies and illegals outside the United Kingdom^^ — a 
list by Mitrokhin of KGB agents, contacts and 
“developmentals” (targets under cultivation) includes a 
tantalizing one-line reference to a British agent run from 



Karlshorst whose operational file in 1981 ran to fifteen 
volumes.^^ 

The most remarkable British agent identified by 
Mitrokhin outside the field of S&T to have been recruited 
after operation FOOT was also run by Line KR outside 
the United Kingdom. Given the codename SCOT, he was 
a bent London copper: Detective Sergeant John Symonds 
of the Metropolitan Police, who became probably the 
most peripatetic of all the KGB’s British agents. The 
London residency, however, was able to claim no credit 
for his recruitment. 

On November 29, 1969, the day that The Times 
published photographs of the footprints on the moon of 
Apollo 12 astronauts, it also carried a front page story 
headlined “London Policeman in Bribe Allegations. 
Tapes Reveal Planted Evidence.” Conversations secretly 
recorded by two undercover Times reporters were said to 
prove that Symonds and at least two other detectives were 
“taking large sums of money in exchange for dropping 
charges, for being lenient with evidence in court, and for 
allowing a criminal to work unhindered.” Symonds, then 
aged thirty-three, admitted to the reporters that he was a 
member of what he called “a little firm in a firm” — 
corrupt detectives in the pay of criminals such as south 
London gang boss Charlie Richardson. 

While awaiting trial at the Old Bailey in 1972, 
Symonds went into hiding for several months, then fled 



abroad. His KGB file reveals that he used a passport 
obtained in the name of his girlfriend’s mentally 
handicapped brother, John Frederick Freeman, and had 
his passport photograph authenticated as that of Freeman 
by the mistress of a member of the Richardson gang. In 
his absence, the two other corrupt policemen identified by 
The Times were sentenced to six and seven years’ 
imprisonment. In August 1972 Symonds entered the 
Soviet embassy in Rabat, told his story, said that his 
money was running out and offered his services to the 
KGB.^^ To be certain that his story attracted the Centre’s 
attention, he gave the name of a Special Branch officer 
guarding the defector Oleg Lyalin, and alleged that he 
was probably corruptible. Symonds also made the 
dramatic claim that Denis Healey, the Secretary of State 
for Defense, regularly bribed Chief Superintendent Bill 
Moody of the Met “to smooth over certain 
unpleasantness.”^^ Though Moody was later convicted of 
accepting huge bribes from the underworld and sentenced 
to twelve years’ imprisonment, the allegation that Healey 
was involved in the bribery was wholly fraudulent. The 
Centre, however, took Symonds ’s tall story at its 
improbable face value. 

Symonds spent the next eight years as a KGB agent. 
Noting that he was “of attractive appearance,” the Centre 
decided to use him as its first British “Romeo spy,” using 
seduction and romance, rather than the traditional cruder 



KGB techniques of sexual compromise and blackmail, to 
recruit or obtain classified information from a series of 
female officials. In 1973 Symonds was posted to Bulgaria 
in order to cultivate suitable targets at Black Sea resorts 
popular with Western tourists. Symonds ’s most important 
sexual conquest was the wife of an official in an FRG 
government ministry. Over the next few years he paid a 
number of visits to Bonn to continue the affair. 
Intelligence from Symonds ’s German girlfriend in 1975 
was considered so important by the Centre that it was 
made the subject of a personal report to Andropov. 

Symonds was used by the KGB to attempt the 
seduction of female officials, mostly Western embassy 
staff, on four continents. His next assignment, after 
beginning his affair with the woman from Bonn, was to 
target women at American and British missions in Africa 
during the latter part of 1973. At the end of the year, 
however, he fell ill in Tanzania with what his KGB file 
describes as “tropical fever,” and had to travel to Moscow 
for medical treatment. As soon as he had recovered, 
Symonds was ordered to cultivate a member of the British 
embassy staff in Moscow, codenamed VERA, who had 
been observed going for long solitary walks in her spare 
time. Posing as Jean-Jacques Baudouin, a Canadian 
businessman attending the 1974 International Polymer 
Exhibition in Moscow, Symonds succeeded in staging an 
apparently chance encounter with VERA and striking up a 
friendship with her. Though Symonds ’s file claims that 



VERA became “attached” to him and gave him details of 
her next posting as well as her home address in Britain, 
there is no indication that she passed on to him any more 
than unimportant personal gossip about some of her 
colleagues and superiors in Moscow and London. The 
Centre, however, considered her a potentially valuable 
source for identifying other, more vulnerable female 
targets in the British embassy. 

In 1976, on KGB instructions, Symonds set out on a 
long journey which took him from Bulgaria through 
Africa and India to south-east Asia. In India he cultivated 
an English woman (codenamed JILL), an Israeli and at 
least five American women. In 1977, however, while in 
Singapore pursuing a secretary at a Western diplomatic 
mission who had been identified as a target for cultivation 
by the local KGB residency, Symonds believed that he 
had come under surveillance, took a flight to Athens and 
returned to Bulgaria. An assessment by Directorate K of 
Symonds ’s work over the previous five years concluded 
that he had shown no sign of dishonesty in his dealings 
with the KGB, had obtained material “of significant 
operational interest” and — but for the fact that his existing 
travel documents had aroused the suspicion of Western 
security services — still had considerable potential as a 
KGB agent. At the request of Kalugin, the head of 
Directorate K, Kryuchkov instructed the Illegals 
Directorate to give Symonds a new identity.^^ 

The identity chosen for Symonds was that of a “dead 



double,” Raymond Francis Everett (codenamed FORST), 
an Australian who had died in childhood during the 
Second World War.^^ On July 23, 1978 Symonds flew 
from Moscow to Tokyo en route to Australasia, carrying a 
forged British passport in the name of Everett, a genuine 
birth certificate in the same name and 8,000 US dollars. 
Once in Australia Symonds was to abandon the British 
passport and use the birth certificate to obtain an 
Australian passport in the name of the dead double. 
Symonds began by spending several months in New 
Zealand developing his legend so that, once in Australia, 
he could pose as an Australian who had spent some years 
in New Zealand. 

In November 1978 SCOT traveled to Australia with a 
group of rugby supporters and began to cultivate 
Margaret, the manageress of a small travel agency, in the 
hope that she would provide the necessary reference for 
his passport application. Symonds ’s cynical report on 
Margaret was probably typical of the way he had sized up 
the previous women he had been instructed to seduce. 
Margaret, he claimed, was tall, thin, plain, round- 
shouldered, had hair on her upper lip and was bound to be 
flattered by his attentions. Symonds pursued her with 
flowers, chocolates, presents and invitations to dinner. 
Unfortunately for Symonds, Margaret was honest as well 
as unattractive. When he asked her to act as a referee, she 
refused on the grounds that the law required her to have 
known him for at least a year. By now Symonds ’s money 



had almost run out. Arrangements for him to receive more 
money via the Canberra residency broke down and his 
landlord locked him out when he failed to pay the rent. A 
female schoolteacher whom he persuaded to put him up 
also threw him out after a fortnight. At one point 
Symonds was reduced to spending several nights in a 
Salvation Army hostel. Eventually, with the help of a 
French bank in Sydney, he was able to withdraw 5,000 
US dollars from a bank account he had opened in the 
name of Freeman (his first alias) in Senegal. 

Early in 1979, using a reference he had forged himself, 
Symonds at last succeeded in obtaining an Australian 
passport in the name of his dead double, Raymond 
Everett. Soon afterward, he caught a flight to Rome, from 
where he traveled to Vienna by train to meet his KGB 
controller. By now, however, Symonds had become 
seriously confused by the complications of acquiring a 
new Australian identity. Unwilling to risk using his new 
Australian passport, he strapped it to his leg beneath his 
sock and traveled instead on the bogus British passport he 
had come to Australia to replace. Once in Vienna, he 
handed over the new passport to his controller, then 
returned to Moscow via Belgrade.^^ 

After his return to Moscow, Andropov, Kryuchkov and 
Grigori Fyodorovich Grigorenko (head of the Second 
Chief Directorate) jointly approved a plan for Symonds to 
cultivate a secretary at the British embassy, posing once 
again as a Canadian businessman. His target on this 



occasion was ERICA, a friend of his earlier target VERA, 
whom he had first met five years earlier. The operation 
failed — ^partly, perhaps, because of Symonds’s 
increasingly run-down appearance. Symonds’s file 
records that “his physical characteristics did not appeal to 
ERICA.”93 

The failed cultivation of ERICA appears to have been 
Symonds’s last operation as a Romeo agent. His file notes 
that, since his return from Australia, he had become more 
and more difficult to handle and resentful of what he 
claimed was the KGB’s lack of trust and interest in him. 
A medical report on Symonds prepared without his 
knowledge concluded that he was emotionally unstable, 
suffering from a psychological disorder and had become 
hypersensitive and inconsistent in his judgments. In 1980 
Symonds left Moscow for Sofia, intending to marry his 
current girlfriend, “Nellie.” The couple, however, soon 
fell out and Symonds requested permission to leave for 
western Europe. Before the Centre had replied to his 
request, Symonds succeeded in making his own way to 
Vienna and thence to Britain. In April 1980, 
accompanied by his solicitor, he surrendered himself to 
the Central Criminal Court, which had issued a warrant 
for his arrest for corruption eight years earlier. 

The Centre’s main fear after Symonds’s return was that 
he might reveal his career as a KGB agent. Should he do 
so, it was decided to dismiss his revelations as fantasy. 



The Bulgarian medical authorities were asked to prepare a 
certificate stating that he was mentally deranged. The 
certificate, however, was not needed. At his trial, in which 
he conducted his own defense, former Detective Sergeant 
Symonds made no reference to his Soviet connection, 
which remained completely unknown to the prosecution. 
Instead, he claimed that he had spent eight years on the 
run from crooked senior detectives who had threatened to 
kill him if he gave evidence in court. Symonds was 
sentenced to two years’ imprisonment on three charges of 
corruptly obtaining a total of 150 pounds from a London 
criminal. The prosecution offered no evidence on five 
further counts of corruption. Symonds was indignant at 
the verdict. ‘T decided to return, hoping to have a fair 
trial,” he told the court. ‘T have not had a fair trial and that 
is all I have to say.”^^ 

AT ALMOST THE moment that Symonds returned to 
England in 1980 to face trial, Lukasevics left for Moscow 
at the end of his eight-year term as London resident. The 
Centre, unimpressed by his performance, concluded that 
he had made inadequate progress in rebuilding the 
residency’s agent network after the 1971 expulsions and 
banished him to his native Latvia.^^ Lukasevics ’s 
successor, the heavy-drinking Arkadi Vasilyevich Guk 
(codenamed YERMAKOV), is remembered by Oleg 
Gordlevsky, who served under him, as “a huge, bloated 



lump of a man, with a mediocre brain but a large reserve 
of low cunning.” He owed his overpromotion to London 
resident largely to the British policy of refusing visas to 
known, and more able, Soviet intelligence officers. Guk’s 
naturally suspicious mind gave rise to a number of 
conspiracy theories: among them the conviction that 
many of the advertisement hoardings on the London 
Underground concealed secret look-out posts from which 
MI5 kept watch for KGB officers and other suspicious 
traveler s.^^ 

During Guk’s first year as resident, a series of 
operations officers were sent home in disgrace. In 1980 
Yuri Sergeyevich Myakov (codenamed MOROZOV), 
who had been posted to London three years earlier, was 
recalled for an allegedly serious breach of security: 
showing KGB material to the GRU residency without first 
gaining Guk’s approval. In 1981 Guk also insisted on 
the recall of Aleksandr Vladimirovich Lopukhin, an 
operations officer working in London under cover as 
correspondent for Komsomolskaya Pravda since 1979, 
whom he denounced for unsatisfactory performance, 
keeping himself apart from Soviet colleagues and 
preferring a Western lifestyle. Also in 1981 the head of 
Line N (Illegals Support), Anatoli Alekseyevich 
Zamuruyev (codenamed ZIMIN), who had occupied a 
cover position in the secretariat of the Cocoa Organization 
since 1977, was declared to be mentally ill and sent back 



to Moscow. 

When Oleg Gordlevsky arrived in London as a Line PR 
officer in the summer of 1982, he found the residency a 
“hotbed of intrigue.” For the previous eight years he had 
been SIS’s most important penetration agent inside the 
KGB. His presence in London eventually compromised 
almost all residency operations. In 1983 Gordlevsky was 
promoted to head of Line PR and deputy resident. On 
being appointed resident-designate in January 1985, he 
was able to fill in most of the remaining gaps in his 
knowledge of the KGB’s British operations. 

Among the intelligence passed by Gordlevsky to MI5 
was information on the attempt by one of its own officers, 
Michael Bettaney, a disaffected alcoholic in the counter- 
espionage directorate, to volunteer as a Soviet agent. On 
Easter Sunday 1983 Bettaney put through Guk’s letter- 
box in Holland Park an envelope containing the case put 
by MI5 for expelling three Soviet intelligence officers in 
the previous month, together with details of how all three 
had been detected. Bettaney offered to provide further 
information and gave instructions on how to contact him. 
Guk thus found himself presented with the first 
opportunity for a quarter of a century to recruit an MI5 or 
SIS officer. His addiction to conspiracy theory, however, 
persuaded him to look the gift horse in the mouth. The 
whole affair, he suspected, was a British provocation. The 
head of Line KR, Leonid Yefremovich Nikitenko, who 
was reluctant to disagree with the irascible Guk, 



concurred. Gordlevsky said little but informed SIS. 

In June and July, Bettaney stuffed two further packets 
of classified information from Security Service files 
through Guk’s door, unwittingly providing what Guk 
believed was clinching evidence of an MI5 provocation. 
Understandably despairing of Guk, Bettaney decided to 
try his luck with the KGB in Vienna instead. He was 
arrested on September 16, a few days before he planned 
to fly out. Guk’s reputation never recovered. Shortly after 
Bettaney was sentenced to twenty- three years’ 
imprisonment the following spring, Guk himself was 
declared persona non grata by the British authorities. 

Guk’s four, somewhat incompetent years as London 
resident included the most dangerous phase of operation 
RYAN. The whole of Line PR in London were skeptical 
about the Centre’s fear that NATO was making plans for 
a nuclear first strike against the Soviet Union. None, 
however, were willing to risk their careers by challenging 
the alarmist assumptions on which RYAN was based. As 
a result, the residency’s chief priority from 1981 until at 
least the early months of 1984 was the preparation of 
fortnightly reports on its search for non-existent evidence 
of NATO preparations for nuclear aggression. The 
Centre’s alarmism reached its peak in November 1983 
during the NATO exercise ABLE ARCHER, which it 
feared might be used to begin the countdown to a first 
strike. In his annual review of the work of the London 
residency at the end of 1983, Guk was forced to admit 



“shortcomings” in obtaining intelligence on “specific 
American and NATO plans for the preparation of surprise 
nuclear missile attack against the USSR.” During the 
early months of 1984, helped by reassuring signals from 
London and Washington, the mood in Moscow gradually 
lightened. In March Nikolai Vladimirovich Shishlin, a 
senior foreign affairs specialist in the Central Committee 
(and later an adviser to Gorbachev), addressed the staff of 
the London embassy and KGB residency on current 
international problems. He made no mention of the threat 
of surprise nuclear attack. The bureaucratic momentum of 
operation RYAN, however, took some time to wind 
down. When the London residency grew lax in the early 
summer of 1984 about sending its pointless fortnightly 
reports, it received a reprimand from the Centre telling it 
to adhere “strictly” to the original RYAN directive. 

Like his predecessor, Lukasevics, Guk tried to 
compensate for his residency’s failings by exaggerating 
the success of its active measures. In particular, he sought 
to take some of the credit for the resurgence of the British 
peace movement caused by the intensification of the Cold 
War in the early 1980s. Twenty years earlier, the KGB 
had been suspicious of the British peace movement, 
fearing that it might detract from the authority of the 
World Peace Council. During Guk’s years as resident, 
however, most sections of the peace movement spent 
more time campaigning against American than against 
Soviet nuclear weapons. In July 1982 Guk briefed the 



newly arrived embassy counselor, Lev Parshin, about a 
mass demonstration in London against the deployment of 
US cruise missiles. Although a few KGB agents and 
contacts joined the march, the demonstration had been 
wholly organized by the Campaign for Nuclear 
Disarmament (CND) without any assistance from the 
residency. Guk, however, assured Parshin, “It was us, the 
KGB residency, who brought a quarter of a million people 
out on to the streets 

The main authentic successes of the London residency 
during Guk’s four years in London were, as during the 
previous two decades, in scientific and technological 
intelligence gathering. Between 1980 and 1983 Gennadi 
Fyodorovich Kotov (codenamed DEYEV), a Line X 
officer working under cover in the Soviet trade 
delegation, ran twelve agents and obtained 600 items of 
S&T information and samples. Another Line X officer, 
Anatoli Alekseyevich Cherny ay ev (codenamed GRIN), 
who operated under diplomatic cover from 1979 to 1983, 
obtained 800 items of classified information. He was 
expelled in 1983 during a round of tit- for- tat expulsions. 
A Centre report concluded that, despite his expulsion, 
Chemyayev might not have been definitely identified by 
MI5 as a KGB officer. Its author, however, was 
unaware that Gordievsky had identified the entire KGB 
residency. 

Following Guk’s expulsion in the spring of 1984, 



Nikitenko, the head of Line KR, was made acting 
resident. In January 1985 the Centre decided that he was 
to return to Moscow in the spring and that the post of 
resident should go to Gordievsky. And so, when Mikhail 
Gorbachev succeeded Konstantin Chernenko as general 
secretary in March 1985, the London residency was at its 
operational nadir, with an SIS agent about to assume 
command of it. 

Only a month later, however, the Washington main 
residency achieved one of its greatest post-war triumphs. 
On April 16 Aldrich Ames, a senior officer in the CIA’s 
Soviet division, walked into the lobby of the Soviet 
embassy on Sixteenth Street and handed a guard a letter 
addressed to the resident, Stanislav Andreyevich 
Androsov. Ames claims that his original aim was a one- 
time scam to extract 50,000 dollars from the KGB by 
revealing the names of three apparent CIA spies in the 
Soviet Union whom he knew were really double agents 
controlled by the Centre. Only later, he insists, did he 
identify Gordievsky and over twenty other genuine 
Western agents, a majority of whom were shot. According 
to Viktor Cherkashin, head of Line KR (counter- 
intelligence) in Washington, however, Ames’s letter of 
April 16, 1985 included, in addition to the names of the 
double agents, the identities of two real American agents 
— one of them a colleague of his in the Washington 
residency. Both were executed. Though Ames insists that 
he did not betray Gordievsky until June 13, it is quite 



possible that he did so earlier. 

By mid-May 1985 the Centre had reached the alarming 
conclusion that its resident-designate in London was a 
British agent — although it remains unclear whether it 
based that conclusion on intelligence from Ames. On May 
17 Gordlevsky received a summons to return to the 
Centre for consultations before formally taking up the 
post of resident. In Moscow he was drugged and 
interrogated, but no admission of guilt extracted from 
him. On May 30 Gordlevsky was given a period of leave 
during which the Centre placed him under constant 
surveillance, doubtless in the hope that he would be 
caught making contact with SIS or provide other 
compromising evidence. He was well aware that, whether 
or not further evidence was obtained against him, it had 
already been decided to execute him as a British agent. 
On July 20, however, Gordlevsky was successfully 
exfiltrated across the Finnish border in the boot of an SIS 
car — the only escape in Soviet history by a Western agent 
under KGB surveillance. In October thirty-one Soviet 
intelligence personnel identified by Gordlevsky were 
expelled from London. Owing to the lack of any more 
senior candidate, the inexperienced Aleksandr Smagin, 
formerly KGB security officer at the Soviet embassy, was 
appointed as the new London resident. 

The greatest known success of KGB operations in 
Britain during the Gorbachev era was the reactivation of 
Michael Smith, probably the most important British Line 



X agent since the retirement of Norwood. When 
Mitrokhin last saw Smith’s file in 1984, he had been 
trying for six years without success to recover the security 
clearance which had made him such a valuable agent in 
the Thom — EMI Weapons Division in 1976-8. By now, 
the Centre was close to writing him off. The last contact 
with Smith noted on his file was in March 1983. In 1984 
it was decided to put him “on ice” for the next three 
years.^^^ In December 1985, however. Smith was taken 
on as a quality assurance engineer by the GEC Hirst 
Research Centre at Wembley, in north-west London, 
where seven months later he was given limited security 
clearance for defense contracts on a need-to-know 
basis. 

In 1990 Line X at the London residency renewed 
contact with Smith, arranging meetings either in the 
graveyard of the church of St. Mary at Harrow on the Hill 
or in the nearby Roxeth recreation park at South Harrow. 
Security procedures were devised at each site to warn 
Smith if it was under surveillance. At St. Mary’s church 
he was told to look for a white chalk line on the vicarage 
wall near a fire hydrant. If the line was uncrossed, it was 
safe for him to enter the graveyard. He was also told to 
look at the church noticeboard. A small green dot, usually 
on a drawing pin, indicated that the meeting with his case 
officer was still on; a red dot was a warning to leave 
immediately. Though Smith had originally been an 
ideological agent, his motives had become increasingly 



mercenary. At meetings between 1990 and 1992 he was 
given a total of over 20,000 pounds for material from 
GEC defense projects, some of which he spent on an 
expensive flamenco guitar, a musical keyboard and 
computer equipment. Smith became increasingly 
confident and careless. When he was arrested in August 
1992, the police found documents on the Rapier ground- 
to-air missile system and Surface Acoustic Wave military 
radar technology in a Sainsbury’s carrier bag in the boot 
of his Datsun.^^^ 

IN THE COURSE of the Cold War, there had been a 
remarkable transformation in the balance of intelligence 
power between Britain and the Soviet Union. When the 
Cold War began, at a time when Britain possessed no 
major intelligence assets in Moscow, the KGB was still 
running the Magnificent Five (Blunt, admittedly, on a 
part-time basis) and had other major agents inside the 
British nuclear project. So far as is known at present, 
there were no comparable British agents during the 
closing years of the Cold War, though it is impossible to 
exclude the possibility (not, however, a probability) that 
there may have been a British Ames who has so far gone 
undetected. SIS, by contrast, attracted a series of KGB 
officers either as penetration agents or as defectors — 
among them Oleg Gordlevsky, Vladimir Kuzichkin, 
Viktor 

Makarov, Mikhail Butko v and Vasili Mitrokhin.^^^ Other 



defectors exfiltrated by SIS included the leading Russian 
scientist Vladimir Pasechnik, who provided extraordinary 
intelligence on the vast Soviet biological warfare 
program. There may well have been other agents and 
defectors whose names have yet to be revealed. On 
present evidence, during the final phase of the Cold War 
SIS had clearly the better of its intelligence duel with the 
KGB. 



TWENTY - SIX 


THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF 

GERMANY 


The Soviet intelligence offensive against West Germany 
during the Cold War had three distinguishing 
characteristics. First, the division of Germany made the 
Federal Republic (FRG) easier to penetrate than any other 
major Western state. So many refugees fled to the West 
from the misnamed German Democratic Republic (GDR) 
— about three million before the building of the Berlin 
Wall in 1961 — that it was not difficult to hide hundreds, 
even thousands, of East German and Soviet agents among 
them. Among the bogus refugees were a series of illegals. 
Some were KGB officers of Soviet nationality who had 
spent several years establishing false German identities in 
the secure environment of the GDR, many of whom 
moved on to operate against north American and other 
targets.^ Others were East German illegal agents recruited 
and trained by the KGB, most of whom were deployed 
against targets in the Federal Republic.^ 

Secondly, the FRG was the only Western state on 



which Moscow received even more high-grade 
intelligence from an allied agency — the Stasi’s foreign 
section, the Hauptverwaltung Aufklumng (HVA)^ — than 
it did from the KGB. From 1952 to 1986 the HVA was 
headed by Markus Johannes “Mischa” Wolf, probably the 
ablest of the Soviet Bloc intelligence chiefs. Wolf was the 
son of a well-known German Communist doctor and 
writer who had been forced to flee to Moscow after 
Hitler’s rise to power. He owed his appointment as head 
of East German foreign intelligence shortly before his 
thirtieth birthday to his devoted Stalinism and hence the 
confidence he inspired in the KGB (then the MGB), as 
well as to his own ability. In 1947 he told his friend 
Wolfgang Leonhard that East German Communists would 
have to give up the idea of the “separate German way to 
socialism” mentioned in their Party program. When 
Leonhard, who worked in the Party central secretariat, 
told him he was wrong. Wolf replied, “There are higher 
authorities than your central secretariat!” Shortly 
afterward, the “higher authorities” in Moscow did indeed 
put an end to talk about the “separate German way.”^ 
Wolf has never suffered from false modesty. “As even my 
bitter foes would acknowledge,” he boasts in retirement, 
“[the HVA] was probably the most efficient and effective 
such service on the European continent.”^ 

The third distinguishing characteristic of Soviet 
intelligence operations in West Germany was that, in 



addition to receiving HVA reports, the KGB’s own 
penetration of the FRG was powerfully assisted by its 
East German allies. As well as establishing legal 
residencies in Bonn, Cologne and Hamburg,^ the KGB 
was also able to run West German operations from its 
base at Karlshorst in the Berlin suburbs. This was the 
largest Soviet intelligence station outside the USSR, using 
East German illegals and other agents supplied by the 
Stasi and HVA. Though the KGB was, in principle, 
responsible for funding its Karlshorst station, in the mid- 
1970s the GDR was contributing 1.3 million marks a year 
to its running costs. ^ 

The first major recruitments by the Karlshorst KGB in 
the FRG which are recorded in the files noted by 
Mitrokhin occurred in 1950. SERGEYEV (also 
codenamed NIKA), a young West German Communist 
recruited in that year, was instructed to distance himself 
from the Communist Party in order to allow him to 
provide intelligence on the Trotskyists in the FRG, with 
whom — despite their political insignificance — the Centre 
remained obsessed for ideological reasons. His file 
records that early in his career as an agent he provided the 
intelligence which made possible the abduction of 
Weiland, a leading Trotskyist, from West Berlin by a 
special actions snatch squad. ^ SERGEYEV became one 
of the KGB’s longest serving West German agents and by 
1963 was receiving a salary of 400 deutschmarks a 



month. A Centre report on his work claims that, “With his 
help, in 1951-74, Trotskyist organizations in the FRG and 
western Europe were cultivated and compromised.” 
Simultaneously, SERGEYEV served for some years as a 
respected north German Biir germeister. Fearing that he 
was under surveillance, the KGB broke contact with him 
in 1981, giving him a final payment of 3,000 
deutschmarks.^ 

Karlshorsf s main achievement in the early years of the 
Federal Republic was the penetration of the semi-official 
West German foreign intelligence agency, the Gehlen 
Org, which from 1956 was officially attached to the 
Federal Chancellery as the Bundesnachrichtendienst 
(BND). In March 1950 Karlshorst recruited “for material 
reward” an unemployed former SS captain, Hans Clemens 
(codenamed KHANNI), who in the following year gained 
a job in the Gehlen Org. Over the next decade he supplied 
what his file describes as “valuable information” on the 
FRG intelligence community: “This made it possible to 
prevent the exposure of valuable agents, and to disrupt 
operations directed against Soviet missions in the 
FRG.”^^ Clemens’s greatest success, however, was to 
recruit a former SS comrade, Heinz Felfe (codenamed 
KURT), whom he successfully recommended for a job in 
the Gehlen Org.^^ With the active assistance of 
Karlshorst, Felfe rapidly established himself as one of the 
most successful agents of the Cold War. According to a 



KGB report, his intelligence, when combined with that 
from the British spies George Blake and Kim Philby, 
made possible “the elimination of the adversary’s agent 
network in the GDR” during the period 1953 to 1955.^^ 

In 1953 Felfe astounded his colleagues in the Gehlen 
Org by announcing that he had set up an agent network in 
Moscow headed by a Red Army colonel. Much of the 
intelligence from the non-existent network — a blend of 
fact and fiction fabricated by the Centre — was passed on 
to the West German chancellor, Konrad Adenauer, in 
Bonn. Simultaneously, Felfe was providing Karlshorst 
with large numbers of FRG intelligence reports. Urgent 
reports went by radio; the remainder were despatched in 
the false bottoms of suitcases, on film concealed in tins of 
babyfood, via dead letter-boxes, or through a Gehlen Org 
courier, Erwin Tiebel, who was also working for 
Karlshorst. By 1958 Felfe had established himself as the 
German Philby, becoming — like Philby in SIS fourteen 
years earlier — head of Soviet counter-intelligence in the 
BND. Unlike Philby, however, his motives had more to 
do with vanity than with ideology. He was, he told 
himself, the supreme intelligence professional, recognized 
as the rising star of the BND yet outwitting it at the same 
time. Karlshorst was careful to boost his ego, encouraging 
him to believe that his achievements were eclipsing even 
those of Richard Sorge. “I wanted,” Felfe said later, “to 
rank as top class with the Russians.” A CIA officer who 
served in Germany during the 1950s concluded after 



Felfe’s arrest in 1961: 


The BND damage report must have run into tens of 
thousands of pages. Not only were agents and 
addresses compromised, but ten years of secret agent 
reports had to be re-evaluated: those fabricated by 
the other side, those subtly slanted, those from purely 
mythical sources. 

Soon after Andropov became KGB chairman in 1967, he 
singled out Felfe — along with Philby, Blake and Vassall 
— as the kind of past agent whose recruitment was, once 
again, urgently needed in order to keep the Soviet 
leadership abreast of the development of Western 
policy. 

THE FRG WAS a major target for KGB active measures 
as well as intelligence collection. The chief priority of 
both KGB and HVA influence operations during the 
1950s and 1960s was to discredit as many West German 
politicians as possible as neo-Nazis and “revenge- 
seekers.” Disinformation almost always works most 
effectively when it includes a basis of fact. In the early 
years of the FRG, there was no shortage of real ex-Nazis 
in positions of power and influence to denounce in active 
measures campaigns. Among the most effective 
denouncers was the Reuters correspondent in Berlin, John 
Peet, who had been recruited as an NKVD agent during 



the Spanish Civil War. In 1950 Peet defected to East 
Berlin, somewhat disconcerted by the excessively 
clandestine preparations made for the defection by his 
East German case officer. All Peet expected was a phone 
call inviting him to coffee from an East Berlin professor 
who frequently visited his West Berlin flat. Instead, the 
professor rang him and, in what struck Peet as a curiously 
high-pitched voice, declared, “PRIMROSE has a message 
for DAFFODIL. 1600 hours on Monday. I repeat, 1600 
hours on Monday.” Once in East Berlin, Peet announced 
at a press conference: 

I simply cannot consent to take part any longer in the 
warmongering which threatens not only the Soviet 
Union and the People’s Democracies, but which is 
also well on the way to converting my motherland, 
Britain, into a powerless American colony. 

From 1952 to 1975 Peet edited the fortnightly Democratic 
German Report, which spent much of its time denouncing 
the past records (often supplied by Wolf) of West German 
politicians, diplomats, industrialists, lawyers, generals and 
police chiefs. Peet regarded as his “prize exhibit” 
Adenauer’s most important aide, Hans Globke, who had 
drafted the infamous official commentary on Hitler’s 
1935 race laws.^^ 

Peet’s propaganda was powerfully reinforced by the 
KGB-arranged defection in July 1954 of Otto John, first 



head of the FRG security service, the Bundesamt fiir 
Verfassungsschutz (BfV). Like Feet four years earlier, 
John gave a press conference at which he denounced the 
alleged revival of Nazism in West Germany. In December 
1955 John reappeared in the West, claiming that he had 
been drugged by Wolfgang Wohlgemuth, a doctor 
working for the KGB. The West German supreme court 
was skeptical. According to other evidence, John was a 
heavy drinker who had been observed crossing to the East 
in a “cheerful” rather than comatose condition, after 
Wohlgemuth had plied him with whisky and played on 
his fears of a Nazi revival. In December 1959 he was 
sentenced to four years in jail, but served only eighteen 
months. Considerable mystery still surrounds the John 
case. The head of the KGB Karlshorst apparat, Yevgeni 
Petrovich Pitovranov, reported to the Centre in July 1954 
that John had come for discussions in East Berlin because 
he “wished to maintain contact with us to discuss political 
problems and joint action against the Nazis of East 
Germany.” John’s decision to remain in the East, 
however, was made under KGB pressure. According to 
one of the KGB officers involved in the John case: 

We wanted to recruit him, but he turned us down. 
Because it was necessary that John remain in East 
Berlin, we put a sleeping pill in his coffee . . . After 
sleeping for about thirty hours, he was worked over 
by specialists from the KGB with psychological 



pressure. He finally said that he would cooperate 
with us. 

Among the deceptions used to persuade John to remain in 
the East was a fake Western news broadcast announcing 
that he had already defected to the GDR.^^ 

The HVA and KGB had at their disposal an archive in 
East Berlin which held Wehrmacht, SS and Nazi records 
seized by the Red Army. In two large volumes of material 
on real and alleged war criminals and neo-Nazis, the 
HVA’s active measures department, Abteilung X, 
combined authentic archival documents and fabricated 
evidence to form a damning indictment of the West 
German political, business and military elite. Abteilung 
X also concocted an additional, highly discreditable 
chapter to the memoirs of Reinhard Gehlen, first head of 
the BND, in an imitation of his handwriting.^^ 

The most celebrated West German target of the KGB 
and the HVA was Willy Brandt, codenamed 
POLYARNIK (“Polar”). From the moment Brandt 
became Bilrgermeister of Berlin in October 1957, he was 
the victim of a series of active measures operations 
designed first to discredit and then to blackmail him. 
Given Brandt’s heroic record of resistance to Hitler, it 
was plainly unrealistic to include him in the KGB’s list of 
neo-Nazi conspirators. Instead, by distorting his early 
career and war record, KGB and HVA active measures 



sought, at various times, to portray him as a Gestapo 
informer, an anti-German emigre, a collaborator with SIS 
and the CIA and even as a former Soviet agent. 

In 1931, shortly before his eighteenth birthday, Willy 
Brandt (bom Herbert Frahm) had become leader of the 
youth section of the Sozialistische Arbeiterpartei (SAP), a 
left-wing breakaway party from the socialist SDP. After 
Hitler’s rise to power in 1933, Brandt went into exile, 
traveling to Norway carrying only a briefcase containing 
the first volume of Marx’s Das Kapital, a few shirts and 
100 marks. Once in Oslo he established himself as the 
SAP representative and began a career as a journalist. In 
Febmary 1937 he traveled to Spain, ostensibly as a 
journalist covering the Civil War but also to act as liaison 
between SAP members of the International Brigades and 
the neo-Trotskyist POUM militia. Brandt quickly 
denounced the “blind terror” waged by the Communists, 
on Soviet instmctions, against POUM and other left-wing 
heretics: 

The tmth of the matter is: the Comintern is 
determined to destroy all forces that refuse to obey 
its orders. It is for this reason that the whole 
international labor movement must rise against it. 

Brandt in turn was, absurdly, denounced by the 
Communists as “an agent of Franco” and “a spy of the 
Gestapo.”^ ^ 



The earliest reference to Brandt in his KGB file is a 
description of him in 1936 as a member of the Danzig 
Trotskyists. The other reports on Brandt during the late 
1930s, all of them hostile, accurately reflect the paranoia 
of the Great Terror. There are fabricated claims that 
POLYARNIK had been tasked by the Paris Shrete to 
infiltrate POUM, that he had betrayed many members of 
the SDP to the Gestapo and that he was involved in the 
murder in Spain of Mark Rein, son of a prominent 
Russian Menshevik, who had in reality been killed by the 
NKVD22 

After Hitler’s invasion of the Soviet Union in June 
1941, Brandt’s attitude to Moscow changed. The NKVD 
residency in Stockholm, whither Brandt had moved after 
the German occupation of Norway, reported that there had 
been a split in the ranks of “Norwegian Trotskyists.” 
Some, including Brandt, were now willing to cooperate 
with the Soviet Union to secure the defeat of Hitler. In the 
autumn of 1941 M. S. Okhunev (codenamed OLEG), an 
operations officer at the Stockholm residency, called on 
Brandt but found him out and left his card. The following 
evening Brandt visited the Soviet embassy and spent three 
hours talking to Okhunev and the NKVD resident, 
Mikhail Sergeyevich Vetrov. Brandt said that he ran a 
news agency whose clients included the American press, 
was ready to do anything to hasten the destruction of 
Nazism and would be happy to send stories from “Soviet 
comrades” to the United States (which had not yet entered 



the war) — if necessary, disguising their source. Vetrov 
and Okhunev replied that the most important contribution 
he could make to the war effort would be to gather 
intelligence from his Norwegian friends on German forces 
and operations in Norway. Brandt agreed, and for the next 
nine months had clandestine meetings once a fortnight 
with officers from the Stockholm residency. On one 
occasion he was handed 500 kroner, probably to meet his 
expenses, and gave a receipt. 

Among the intelligence supplied by Brandt from his 
Norwegian sources was information on the German 
battleship Tirpitz, which left the Norwegian port of 
Trondheim in March 1942 to attack Arctic convoys. 
Brandt informed the NKVD that he had passed the same 
information to the British, who tried and failed to sink 
it.^^ He also supplied the Stockholm residency with 
information on German pressure on Sweden to join the 
Anti-Comintem Pact and on plans (never implemented) to 
ban the Swedish Communist Party. In the summer of 
1942, after the arrest by the Swedish police of two Czech 
agents of the residency, TERENTY and VANYA,^^ 
Brandt refused further secret rendezvous with NKVD 
officers, despite pressure from the residency to continue 
them. He did, however, agree to come openly to the 
Soviet embassy, sometimes to meet intelligence officers 
operating under diplomatic cover.^^ 

None of this makes POLYARNIK a Soviet agent. The 



Stockholm residency reported in 1943 that Brandt had 
also been in touch with British and American intelligence 
officers in Sweden, as well as with Trotsky’s Norwegian 
former secretary, who remained deeply suspect as far as 
the Centre was concemed.^^ Brandt’s overriding motive 
was to provide any information to all three members of 
the Grand Alliance which might contribute to the defeat 
of Hitler. In the case of the Soviet Union, he calculated 
accurately that his best channel of communication with 
Moscow was via the Stockholm residency. 

The first attempt to discredit Brandt after his election as 
Berlin Bilrgermeister in 1957 was a lengthy operation 
carried out jointly by the KGB and HVA in 1958-9 to use 
tendentious versions of his wartime record and other 
fabrications to show him as an agent of British and 
American intelligence. But, as the file on the operation 
acknowledges, “This did not produce the desired result, 
and Brandt’s position as a politician was not 
undermined. Wolf next proposed reviving the old 
slander that Brandt had been a Gestapo agent during his 
Norwegian exile, but the East German leadership ordered 
the plan to be aborted due to lack of credible evidence.^^ 

In the 1961 West German elections Brandt stood as the 
SDP candidate for the chancellorship. The campaign was 
the dirtiest in the history of the FRG. Brandt was assailed 
by what he denounced as “a right-wing barrage of mud.” 
The fact that he had spent the Nazi years in exile led to 



accusations that he was unpatriotic, while his background 
as a left-wing socialist gave rise to insinuations that he 
was a crypto-Communist. Brandt was deeply depressed 
by the “political pornography” used to discredit him. “My 
opponents,” he later admitted, “were sometimes 
successful to the extent that they kept me from my work 
for days on end.” Sensing his vulnerability, the Stasi gave 
secret but, in Brandt’s view, “vigorous encouragement” to 
some of the charges fabricated against him.^^ 

Though the SDP succeeded in cutting the Christian 
Democrat majority (thanks largely to the building of the 
Berlin Wall during the campaign), the Centre decided to 
threaten Brandt with far more damaging evidence than 
had surfaced during the elections. On November 16, 1962 
Semichastny, the KGB chairman, formally approved a 
blackmail operation proposed by Sakharovsky, the head 
of the FCD. Though there is no mention of it in the file 
seen by Mitrokhin, the operation was also, almost 
certainly, approved by Khrushchev, still smarting from 
the humiliating outcome of the Cuban missile crisis in the 
previous month. The operational plan was for Brandt to 
be approached by the Izvestia correspondent, Polyanov, to 
whom he had given an interview earlier in the year. On 
this occasion, Polyanov would be accompanied by an 
undercover KGB operations officer who would tell 
Brandt, “We would like to resume our confidential 
relations with you in order to develop together sensible 
solutions to the West Berlin question.” If Brandt refused. 



he was to be told, “We have sufficient means to cause you 
unpleasantness, and therefore assume that you will 
reconsider your position.” The threat was in fact largely 
bluff. Sakharovsky had been annoyed to discover that the 
original documents in Brandt’s wartime operational file 
had been destroyed in 1959 (an inconceivable action had 
he actually been an agent), among them such apparently 
compromising items as his receipt for 500 kroner for the 
Stockholm residency. Brandt, however, would be 
unaware of this. The operational plan approved by 
Semichastny confidently asserts that Brandt must believe 
that “there are materials in our possession which could 
compromise him.”^^ 

Mitrokhin did not see the report on the meeting with 
Brandt. It is clear, however, that — if it went ahead — 
Brandt brushed the attempted KGB blackmail aside. 
Semichastny and Sakharovsky had almost certainly 
intended, with Khrushchev’s approval, to soften up 
Brandt before a meeting with the Soviet leader. In January 
1963, while on a visit to East Berlin, Khrushchev duly 
invited Brandt to a meeting. Already convinced of the 
need to reach a modus vivendi between the FRG and GDR 
as well as to settle the Berlin question, Brandt was willing 
to accept. Opposition to the proposed meeting from the 
Christian Democrats in the ruling West Berlin coalition, 
however, persuaded him to refuse. According to Brandt: 


Khrushchev must have taken my refusal as an 



affront. Ambassador [Pyotr Andreyevich] 

Abrasimov later gave me a vivid description of the 
total dismay that overcame his erstwhile master 
when the news was communicated to him. 
Khrushchev, caught in the act of changing, almost 
dropped his trousers with surprise . . .^^ 

Brandt’s four and a half years as West Germany’s first 
SDP chancellor, from October 21, 1969 to May 6, 1974, 
marked the high water mark of the HVA and KGB 
intelligence offensive in the FRG. Wolfs greatest success 
was the penetration of the Chancellor’s office by Gunter 
Guillaume (codenamed HANSEN). In 1956 Guillaume 
and his wife Christel, both HVA officers, had staged a 
carefully orchestrated “escape” from East Germany, set 
up small businesses in Frankfurt to act as cover for their 
intelligence work and become active, apparently 
staunchly anti-Communist, members of the SDP. By 1968 
Guillaume had become chairman of the Frankfurt SDP 
and an elected member of the Frankfurt city council, thus 
becoming the only HVA officer (as opposed to agent) 
ever to hold public office in the FRG. In November 1969, 
three weeks after Brandt became chancellor, Guillaume 
gained a job in his office, initially as an assistant dealing 
with trade unions and political organizations. 
Hardworking and efficient, with a jovial down-to-earth 
manner, he was promoted in 1972 to become the 
Chancellor’s aide for relations with the SDP, as well as 



being put in charge of Brandt’s travel arrangements. His 
reports were so highly rated in the Centre that they were 
personally forwarded by Andropov to foreign minister 
Gromyko. 

The key intelligence requirement placed on Guillaume 
concerned Brandt’s Ostpolitik, which he defined as 
having “a threefold aim: improved relations with the 
Soviet Union, normal relations with the east European 
states, and a modus vivendi between the two parts of 
Germany.” In his “Report on the State of the Nation” to 
the Bundestag at the beginning of 1970, Brandt called for 
“cooperative togetherness” between the FRG and GDR. 
In the course of the year he became the first chancellor to 
visit East Germany, and signed treaties with the Soviet 
Union and Poland.^^ “Through Guillaume’s judgments,” 
writes Wolf in his memoirs, “we were able to conclude 
sooner rather than later that Brandt’s new Ostpolitik, 
while still riven with contradictions, marked a genuine 
change of course in West German foreign policy.”^^ 
Moscow reached the same conclusion. After Brandt’s 
visit to East Germany, however, Karlshorst reported “a 
noticeable rise in his popularity, which caused some 
concern to the GDR leadership. During his visit, as the 
crowds chanted, “Willy, Willy!,” Brandt mischievously 
asked the East German prime minister, Willi Stoph, 
whether the name being chanted was spelled with a “y” or 
an “i.” Stoph remained stony-faced.^^ 



With the Christian Democrats in open opposition to 
Brandt’s Ostpolitik, the Centre was now concerned not to 
compromise Brandt but to keep him in power. By the 
spring of 1972 a series of defections from the SDP and its 
Free Democrat allies had reduced Brandt’s majority to 
four. With more defections in the offing, the fate of 
Ostpolitik hung in the balance. In April 1972, confident of 
success, the CDU (Christian Democrat) leader, Rainer 
Barzel, tabled a motion of no confidence. With the 
blessing of the Centre, Wolf made a possibly critical 
secret intervention in the Bundestag with the aim of 
keeping Brandt in power. 

Shortly before the crucial vote of confidence, the HVA 
had recruited a corrupt CDU deputy, Julius Steiner, as an 
agent with the codename SIMSON.^^ Wolf paid Steiner 
50,000 marks to vote for Brandt.^^ Barzel’s no confidence 
motion failed by two votes. At a general election in 
November, Brandt won a more secure parliamentary 
majority, with the SDP for the first time beating the 
Christian Democrats in the popular vote.^^ The HVA 
continued to run SIMSON as an agent in the new 
Bundestag. In February 1973 Steiner agreed to a contract 
with the HVA (euphemistically described as the 
“Structural Working Group of the GDR Council of 
Ministers”), under which he was paid a retainer of 3,000 
marks a month. Soon afterward (the date is not recorded 
by Mitrokhin), Wolf reported to the Centre that Steiner 



was in contact with the BfV, the West German counter- 
intelligence agency, and thus useless as an agent.^^ In 
June the Munich weekly Quick published a photograph of 
a bank deposit slip showing that 50,000 marks had been 
paid into Steiner’s account the day after the April 1972 
vote of confidence, thus provoking a public scandal which 
was quickly dubbed “Bonn’s Watergate” or “Rhinegate.” 
Steiner acknowledged being recruited as an HVA agent 
but claimed that he had worked as a double agent with the 
approval of the BfV, and said that the 50,000 marks had 
come from the SDP chief whip, Karl Wienand^^ — a 
charge denied by Wienand (who, it later transpired, was 
also an HVA agent). A parliamentary inquiry decided 
that there was no conclusive evidence of bribery. 

By the time of Brandt’s victory in the November 1972 
elections, Guillaume was at the peak of his career as a 
penetration agent, attending all meetings of the SDP party 
and parliamentary leadership. On May 29, 1973, however, 
Gunter Nollau, head of the BfV, informed Hans-Dietrich 
Genscher, the interior minister, that Guillaume was under 
suspicion of espionage and had been placed under 
surveillance. (Their recollections later differed over how 
serious the suspicions reported by Nollau were.)^^ Shortly 
afterward, alerted — according to Wolfs not wholly 
reliable account — ^by the BfV’s clumsy surveillance of 
Guillaume’s wife, the HVA ordered both Gunter and 
Christel Guillaume to suspend their intelligence work.^^ 



At 6:30 a.m. on April 24, 1974 the Guillaumes were 
arrested at their Bonn apartment. In a curious breach of 
espionage tradecraft, Guillaume virtually admitted his 
guilt. Dressed only in a bathrobe, he declared defiantly, “I 
am an officer of the [East German] National People’s 
Army!” According to Genscher, “It was basically only 
Guillaume’s own declaration which convicted him.”^^ 
Wolf now argues that his success in penetrating 
Brandt’s entourage was “equivalent to kicking a football 
into our own goal.” The political scandal caused by 
Guillaume’s arrest was the immediate cause of Brandt’s 
resignation on May 6, 1974. The HVA, Wolf concludes, 
“unwittingly helped to destroy the career of the most 
farsighted of modem German statesmen.”^^ 

THE HVA OPERATIONS in West Germany which had 
had the greatest influence on the KGB’s own methods 
were probably those of its “Romeo spies (a phrase 
invented by the Western media but later taken over by 
Wolf himself).^ ^ The KGB had specialized in the sexual 
entrapment of Western diplomats and visitors to Moscow 
since the 1930s. The entrapment followed a 
straightforward sequence: the use of attractive female or 
male swallows as sexual bait, the seduction of the target, 
the secret photography of the sexual encounter (and, on 
occasion, the intermption of the encounter by a 
supposedly outraged “spouse” or “relative”), followed by 



blackmail. Wolfs tactics were both more subtle and 
more effective. Love, or a plausible semblance of it, was 
capable of generating more intelligence over a longer 
period than brief sexual encounters.^^ The main targets of 
the Romeo spies were lonely female secretaries, most in 
their thirties or forties, employed in West German 
ministries and intelligence agencies. 

Beginning in the late 1950s, the KGB base in 
Karlshorst began imitating the HVA’s “secretaries 
offensive.” Indeed, the KGB files seen by Mitrokhin show 
that some of the “secretary spies” later thought to be HVA 
agents were in fact working for the KGB. Karlshorsf s 
initial targets were female employees in the Bonn Foreign 
Ministry identified by a KGB agent in the ministry’s 
personnel department, Gisela Herzog (codenamed 
MARLENE), recruited in 1954 — without, apparently, the 
use of a Romeo spy. Herzog herself married an official 
from the French defense ministry in 1958 and moved to 
Paris. The first victim of the KGB’s secretaries offensive 
was Herzog’s friend Leonore Heinz (codenamed LOLA), 
secretary to a foreign ministry department head. Her 
seducer was Heinz Siitterlin (codenamed WALTER), a 
West German from Freiburg recruited by the KGB in 
1957, whose first name, confusingly, was identical to 
Leonore’ s surname. When Herzog heard in 1958 that the 
30-year-old Leonore Heinz had succumbed to Siitterlin’ s 
advances, she became consciencestricken. Probably 
foreseeing Heinz’s devastation when she discovered that 



she had been deceived, Herzog wrote to the Centre, “I 
should like to say that you should not involve LOLA in 
co-operation with us through Siitterlin. She would be very 
disillusioned.” “I do ask you,” she wrote on another 
occasion, “to please leave LOLA in peace. The Centre, 
predictably, paid no attention. 

In December 1960 Heinz Siitterlin and Leonore Heinz 
were married. Over the next year Siitterlin frequently 
discussed with his wife the danger that the Cold War 
might turn into hot war. At a time when the West German 
leadership were building themselves nuclear shelters, he 
argued that they had to be concerned for their own safety. 
Leonore agreed to confide in him everything she knew 
about East — West relations. In 1961, at first unwittingly, 
she was included in the KGB agent network. Two years 
later, Siitterlin reported to the Centre that, without 
mentioning the KGB, he had told his wife he was passing 
on her information to an organization dedicated to 
preventing nuclear war: 

I told LOLA that there is one great organization in 
the world which regards the preservation of peace as 
its task. This organization requests one great favor 
from her. She must continue to work in the foreign 
ministry and report to me everything that she finds 
out . . . The organization thinks well of her work . . . 
She has agreed to cooperate in every way she can, 
and declared that she regards it as the duty of every 



decent person to seek to tie the hands of 
warmongers. She declined to receive money for her 
help. I believe that in LOLA we have an assistant on 
whom one may rely totally. 

Though his wife refused payment, Siitterlin received 
1,000 marks a month. 

From 1964 onward, Siitterlin handed film of documents 
LOLA had smuggled out of the ministry to the East 
German illegal Eugen Runge (codenamed MAKS), who 
was working for the Karlshorst KGB. Runge, in turn, left 
the film in a dead letter-box which was emptied by the 
Bonn residency. After Leonore at last realized that she 
was working for the Soviet Bloc, Runge had a personal 
meeting with her. He found her unperturbed by her 
discovery. Leonore said that she trusted her husband 
absolutely, and that her work in the cause of peace was a 
job that had to be done. Siitterlin told Runge that Leonore 
was also motivated by “hatred for the caste of haughty 
foreign ministry officials” and “derived satisfaction from 
causing as much damage as she could. His comment 
supplies a missing element in traditional explanations of 
the success of the HVA and KGB secretaries offensive. 
Though most of the secretaries began spying for love, 
their espionage was probably sustained, at least in part, by 
the arrogance of some of their better-educated and better- 
paid male superiors. 

In 1967 Runge defected to the CIA, betraying both 



Leonore and Heinz Siitterlin. Runge told his debriefers, 
“We received [FRG diplomatic] documents before they 
moved across Leonore ’s desk and on to the code room, 
and we read the reports brought by diplomatic couriers 
from abroad, mostly even before German Foreign 
Minister [Gerhard] Schrider got them.” As her friend 
Gisela Herzog had feared nine years earlier, Leonore was 
distraught at the discovery that she had been targeted by a 
Romeo spy. During her police interrogation, she was 
confronted with a confession by her husband that he had 
married her not for love but on orders from the KGB. 
Soon afterward Leonore hanged herself in her cell.^^ 

TWO OF THE other most successful seductions in the 
KGB’s secretaries offensive recorded in files seen by 
Mitrokhin — those of DORIS and ROSIE — also involved a 
false flag recruitment and the use of East German illegals. 
The false flag, however, differed from that which had 
deceived LOLA. DORIS and ROSIE believed they were 
working not for an underground peace movement but for 
a secret neo-Nazi group. 

DORIS was Margret Hike, a secretary in the office of 
the West German president, where she worked 
successively in the mobilization and security departments. 
Her Romeo spy was the East German illegal Hans-Jurgen 
Henze (codenamed HAGEN), who assumed the identity 
of Franz Becker, a West German living in the GDR.^^ 
Henze discovered the 3 3 -year-old Hike by chance. One 



day in 1968, while looking out of the window of his Bonn 
apartment, he saw a woman who struck him as a possible 
civil servant going for a walk alone. Henze stood waiting 
in a telephone kiosk along her route and, as Hike passed 
by, asked if she had change for a phone call. Somehow he 
also managed to strike up a conversation and, on 
discovering where she worked, arranged another meeting 
with her. Gradually, according to Hike’s operational file, 
“She fell seriously in love and was greatly attached to 
him.” Henze explained that he was a postgraduate student 
writing a dissertation on the work of the president, but 
needed additional source material before he could 
complete it. Hike supplied documents from work to help 
finish the fictional thesis. Though less infatuated than 
Hike, Henze also became emotionally involved in their 
relationship and for several years “found it difficult to 
switch to a business footing.” Finally in 1971 or 1972 (the 
date is unclear from the file), hoping to appeal to Hike’s 
somewhat extreme right-wing views, he told her he 
belonged to an organization of “German patriots,” based 
in Brazil, who were committed to the cause of national 
revival and needed inside information on the Bonn 
government to continue their work.^^ 

Hike said she had guessed something of the sort and 
agreed to assist the “German patriots.” Henze then 
persuaded her to sign a contract, allegedly drawn up by 
his “boss,” under which she agreed to provide information 
from the President’s office in return for her expenses and 



500 marks a month. Among the intelligence she supplied 
were the mobilization plans of the Chancellor’s office and 
the major Bonn ministries; details on the government war 
bunker (which were reported to Brezhnev); despatched 
from FRG ambassadors in Moscow, Washington and 
elsewhere; the secret weekly reports to the President from 
the foreign ministry; a dossier on Brezhnev’s visit to the 
FRG; and accounts of the President’s meetings with 
foreign diplomats. Hike gradually became dependent on 
the 500 marks she received each month. In order to leave 
no trace of it in her own financial records, she gave it to 
her mother to invest on her behalf, telling her that she 
found it difficult to save herself With the help of her 
mother’s investments. Hike was able to buy a new 
apartment (Apartment 85, House 16, am Baitzaplen 37, 
Oberkassel).^^ 

After Hike signed her agent contract, she ceased to take 
the risks of smuggling classified material back to her flat. 
Instead, Henze taught her how to photograph documents 
in the President’s office with a miniature camera 
concealed in a tube of lipstick. On one occasion Hike’s 
boss entered the room just as she was about to use the 
camera, but — to her immense relief — failed to notice what 
she was doing. She usually handed over the film either 
in Cologne or Zurich. The yavka (secret rendezvous) in 
Cologne was at 8:30 p.m. on the first Tuesday of each 
month in Kiln-Bayenthal, at the end of Bayenthalgiirtel, 



about fifty meters from the Bismarck column, by a 
telephone kiosk next to an advertising pillar. Hike was 
told to have a copy of Der Spiegel in her hand if she was 
ready to go ahead with the meeting; if she needed to give 
a danger signal, she was to carry a plastic bag instead. 
The meetings in Zurich took place at 5 o’clock on 
Saturday afternoons at Rennweg 35, by the window of a 
china shop.^^ 

Henze was twice awarded the Order of the Red Star for 
his success in running Hike as an agent. In 1976 he 
returned to East Germany but continued to meet her 
regularly in Cologne and Zurich. Hike was temporarily 
put on ice in 1979 during a security scare caused by the 
investigation of another secretary suspected of spying for 
the East, but was reactivated a year later with the new 
codename VERA. By 1980 the “product file” of the 
documents she had provided filled ten volumes. Though 
Hike remained in touch with Henze, she also passed on 
intelligence through RENATA, a female East German 
illegal working for the KGB.^^ Among the intelligence 
she supplied during the early 1980s were details of talks 
in October 1982 between Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich 
Genscher and US Secretary of State George Schultz over 
the stationing of Pershing II missiles in the ERG. She also 
took part in two major NATO WINTEX exercises, during 
which she had been able to provide intelligence on the 
ERG wartime command and control system, and was able 



to report on her experience of working inside the secret 
wartime government bunker in the Eiffel hills near Bonn. 

Hike was arrested in 1985, and quickly confessed. In 
1987 she was sentenced to eight years in jail and fined 
33,000 marks, the total sum she was believed to have 
received from the KGB (probably an underestimate). The 
judge told her that, in passing a relatively lenient 
sentence, he was taking into account that she had fallen 
“hopelessly in love” with her recruiter. The British press 
was curiously divided in its opinion of Hike. Though the 
Daily Telegraph described her as a “dowdy secretary,” 
she impressed the Observer as a “Glamour Spy.”^^ 

The methods used to recruit Hike were similar to those 
employed against Heidrun Hofer (codenamed ROSIE), a 
secretary in her early thirties in the ERG foreign 
intelligence service, the Bundesnachrichtensdienst 
(BND).^^ While serving at the BND Paris station during 
the early 1970s Hofer was seduced by ROLAND, an East 
German illegal with a military bearing who, like Henze, 
claimed to be working for a neo-Nazi group of “German 
patriots. Hofer’ s deception was taken one stage further 
than that of Hike. On February 26, 1973 at Innsbruch in 
Austria, ROLAND introduced her to VLADIMIR, telling 
her that he was one of the leaders of the neo-Nazi 
underground. Next day VLADIMIR met Hofer alone, 
telling her that he had known Admiral Canaris, wartime 
head of the Abwehr (German military intelligence), in 



which her father had served, and discussed the 
intelligence which he wanted her to supply. Unknown to 
Hofer, VLADIMIR was, in reality, a senior KGB illegal, 
Ivan Dmitryevich Unrau, an ethnic German bom in 
Russia in 1914.^^ 

In 1974 Hofer was transferred to BND headquarters at 
Pullach in Bavaria, where she worked successively for the 
west European and NATO liaison departments, and 
became engaged to a BND major.^^ Following the end of 
her affair with ROLAND, the KGB used two further East 
German illegals, MAZON (who pretended to be 
ROLAND’S father) and FRANK, to maintain contact with 
her. Both pretended to be members of the neo-Nazi 
underground.^^ Hofer appears eventually to have realized 
that she had been recmited under false flag but to have 
carried on working as a paid KGB agent. On December 
21, 1977, possibly as the result of a tip-off to the BND 
from the French SDECE, she was arrested while driving 
across the Austrian border to meet her controller. Next 
day she confessed to being a KGB agent. Hofer showed 
little emotion until told that her BND fiance had broken 
off their engagement. After bursting into tears, she asked 
for the window to be opened to give her some air, then 
suddenly leaped to her feet and threw herself from the 
sixth floor. Though her fall was partially broken by some 
bushes, she was critically injured. 

Apart from Hike and Hofer, the most successful KGB 



recruitment made by an East German Romeo spy during 
the 1970s appears to have been that of Elke Falk 
(codenamed LENA). After Falk had advertised in a lonely 
hearts column, she was contacted by the illegal Kurt 
Simon (codenamed GEORG), who introduced himself as 
Gerhard Thieme. It is unclear from Mitrokhin’s notes 
what, if any, false flag Simon employed to recruit her. 
However, with his encouragement, Falk gained a job in 
1974 as a secretary in the Chancellor’s office,^^ taking 
with her to work a miniature camera disguised as a 
cigarette lighter and a bogus can of hairspray in which to 
store her films. Like Hike, Falk was a member of the 
crisis management team during the WINTEX exercises. 
In 1977 the Centre awarded Simon the Order of the Red 
Star. Later Falk was moved to the control of two other 
illegals, one who used the alias “Peter Muller” and a 
second who was codenamed ADAM.^^ Falk moved from 
the Chancellor’s office to the transport ministry in 1977, 
then in 1979 to the economic aid ministry two years 
later.^^ By 1980, when Mitrokhin saw her operational file, 
it filled seven volumes. Falk was arrested in 1989 but 
wrongly described at her trial as an HVA rather than a 
KGB agent. Though sentenced to six and a half years’ 
imprisonment, she served only a few months before being 
released as part of an East — West spy exchange. Falk was 
alleged to have received a total of 20,000 marks for her 
espionage. 



NOT ALL THE Romeo spies, however, achieved results. 
Among the failures was one of the KGB’s East German 
illegals, Wilhelm Kahle (codenamed WERNER), who 
assumed the identity of a West German living in the 
GDR. Kahle ’s cover occupations included working as a 
laboratory technician in Cologne and Bonn universities 
and as a German language teacher in Paris. During the 
early 1970s he set out to cultivate four ERG foreign 
ministry and embassy secretaries, a female clerk at an 
American embassy in Europe, an American student at a 
German university who invited him to her parents’ home 
in the United States and a British secretary at NATO. 
Kahle ’s ten- volume file, however, contains no indication 
that he obtained significant intelligence from any of them. 
His main West German cultivation was BELLA, who 
worked at the ERG embassies in Tehran and, from 1975, 
in London. According to WERNER’ s file, his attempts to 
recruit BELLA during her tour of duty in London showed 
“insufficient determination” and were hampered by a 
number of operational errors, such as attracting the 
attention of the embassy security officer. Kahle became 
more interested in MONA, a French technical translator 
for a firm of Swedish paper manufacturers in Paris, where 
he was based from 1975 onward. His file records that he 
had “intimate relations” with MONA and wished to marry 
her. The Centre, however, became understandably 
skeptical both of MONA’s intelligence potential and of 



Kahle’s motives in pursuing her. The KGB also 
discovered, through tapping the telephone and 
intercepting the correspondence of Kahle’s mother in East 
Germany, that he was fearful of being recalled to Moscow 
and anxious about the fate of his crystal and porcelain 
collections in Paris, of which the Centre was previously 
unaware. 

In 1978 Kahle was duly summoned back to Moscow 
and given a lie-detector test — on the pretext that it would 
be valuable experience if he were subjected to a 
polygraph during his next posting. As a further method of 
discovering what WERNER had really been up to, an 
impeccably ideologically orthodox female agent, ANITA, 
was planted on him — the only known example of a 
Romeo agent being targeted by a “Juliet.” ANITA’s 
report confirmed the Centre’s suspicions. When she asked 
why he thought he had been recalled, Kahle replied with a 
grin that he had become “too comfortable” in Paris, had 
made many friends and acquaintances and had acquired a 
well-appointed, attractively furnished apartment which he 
was reluctant to leave. He had also broken KGB 
regulations by leaving some of his possessions with 
MONA and by borrowing 3,000 francs from her. ANITA 
claimed to be shocked by Kahle’s “ideological crisis:” 

It would do him no harm to refresh his knowledge of 

Marxism-Leninism, and especially the course on the 

political economy of socialism. He was not imbued 



with a class instinct, as he had been brought up in a 
petty bourgeois environment. Life in the West had 
left its mark on him; as the saying goes, “dripping 
water wears away stone.” His beliefs could be those 
of the French Communist Party. The dictatorship of 
the proletariat was like a red rag to a bull for him; he 
was not convinced of its necessity and he had little 
faith in the advantages of the socialist planned 
economy. WERNER had only encountered the 
chocolate icing side of the West. He had been in 
contact with people who were contented, rich and 
successful. He had not seen unemployment and 
poverty. 

As a result of ANITA’s report, Kahle appears to have 
been sidelined. He was formally removed from illegal 
work in 1982.^^ 

A PART FROM THE secretary spies, the KGB’s most 
productive penetrations of the West Germany bureaucracy 
during the 1970s were probably two recruits in the 
intelligence community. One was awarded the Order of 
the KGB Badge of Honor {Znak Pochota) for his “fruitful 
collaboration.”^^ The other, whose recruitment was 
personally approved by Andropov himself, was ranked by 
the KGB’s Karlshorst base as among its most valuable 
agents. By the early 1980s, however, both sources seem 



to have dried up. 

HVA penetrations of FRG intelligence agencies were at 
least as impressive as those by the KGB. In 1973 Gabriele 
Gast, who had been recruited by an HVA Romeo three 
years earlier, joined the BND as an analyst and rose to 
become deputy head of the Soviet Bloc division in 1987, 
the most highly placed woman in the maledominated 
West German foreign intelligence agency. Gast’s 
motivation was complex. As well as her emotional 
involvement with her recruiter, she was suspicious of the 
FRG political system and deeply fascinated by Markus 
Wolf. According to Wolf, “She needed to feel wanted by 
me and I gave her my personal attention . . . Sometimes 
her messages carried the wounded tone of a lover who 
feels taken for granted.” Wolf met her personally seven 
times. His attentions were richly rewarded. “Gaby’s work 
for us,” he recalls, “was flawless. She gave us an accurate 
picture of the West’s knowledge of and its judgments 
regarding the entire Eastern Bloc. This proved vitally 
important to us in handling the rise of Solidarity in Poland 
in the early 1980s.” Some of the intelligence assessments 
by Gast which so impressed Wolf also landed on the desk 
of Chancellor Kohl and, almost certainly, on those of 
Andropov, Chernenko and Gorbachev as well.^^ 

In 1981 Klaus Kuron of the BfV offered his services by 
letter to the HVA residency in Bonn. A senior counter- 
intelligence officer who specialized in running “turned” 
HVA agents, Kuron was bitter at having been passed over 



for the top jobs and now found himself in increasing 
financial difficulty. He struck Wolf as “unembarrassed 
about his treachery . . . His was a paradigm of unfulfilled 
ambitions of a type that fester throughout any civil 
service.” The HVA skilfully pandered to his wounded 
self-esteem as well as paying him a total of almost 
700,000 marks in the last eight years of its existence. 

In 1985 Hans-Joachim Tiedge, the BfV’s counter- 
intelligence chief, caused even greater surprise than 
Kuron with his letter four years earlier by arriving drunk 
and unkempt at the East German border and demanding to 
defect. Tiedge was a heavy gambler as well as an 
alcoholic, who had come close to being charged with 
manslaughter after the death of his wife in a drunken 
household brawl. “If a case like mine had been presented 
to me for analysis,” he told the HVA, “I would have 
recommended that I be fired without delay.” The first 
prostitute summoned by Wolf to entertain Tiedge after his 
defection took one look at him and ran away. But, claims 
Wolf, “Tiedge had a memory like a computer for names 
and connections, and filled in a lot of the blanks for us — 
though not as many as he thought, since he was unaware 
that his colleague Kuron was in our pay.”^^ 

PERHAPS THE MOST complex aspect of HVA 
operations in the ERG concerned its contacts either 
directly or through intermediaries with politicians. The 
great majority of meetings between West German 



politicians and representatives of the GDR were part of a 
genuine attempt to establish a dialogue, often necessarily 
out of public view, between East and West. The fact that 
the Stasi inevitably took a close interest in these 
encounters is not sufficient to brand those politicians from 
the FRG who took part in them as collaborators with the 
HVA. In a small minority of cases, however, such 
contacts acted as a cover for espionage or something close 
to it. 

The most notorious case of a West German politician 
acting as an HVA agent is that of Karl Wienand, an SDP 
parliamentary whip during the Brandt government and 
one of the closest colleagues of Herbert Wehner, leader of 
the parliamentary party. After the collapse of East 
Germany, evidence emerged from Stasi files that 
Wienand had been an HVA agent from 1970 until the 
Berlin Wall came down in 1989. In 1996 he was 
sentenced to two and a half years’ imprisonment and 
fined a million marks — the total of the payments he had 
received from the HVA.^^ According to Foreign Minister 
Hans-Dietrich Genscher, Wienand was the only person to 
enjoy the trust of all three members of the triumvirate 
which ran the SDP after Brandt’s resignation: Helmut 
Schmidt, the new chancellor, Brandt, who remained party 
chairman, and Wehner.^^ Wolf claims that Wienand, 
whose motivation was “extraordinarily materialistic,” 
gave him “an enviable insight” into the policies of, and 
tensions between, the triumvirate at the top of the SDP. 



That insight also seems to have impressed the Centre. 
According to Wolf, the KGB itself made an attempt to 
“do business” with Wienand, but he “succeeded in 
dissuading our Soviet colleagues” from doing so.^^ 

The most controversial case of a senior West German 
politician in close contact with the East concerns Herbert 
Wehner. References to Wehner which have been 
discovered in Soviet and GDR documents since the fall of 
the Berlin Wall have led to much speculation as to 
whether, like his colleague Wienand, he was an agent for 
the HVA or KGB.^^ The Centre’s file on Wehner 
(codenamed KORNELIS) shows that he was a 
“confidential contact” of both the KGB and the HVA, but 
not a fully recruited agent. Wehner’ s contacts with 
Soviet intelligence went back to his years as a member of 
the KPD (German Communist Party) leadership-in-exile 
in Moscow after Hitler’s rise to power. During the Great 
Terror he had denounced a number of his comrades as 
traitors,^^ and was considered for recruitment as an 
NKVD agent. Wehner’ s KGB file, however, reveals that 
he himself narrowly escaped execution. One KPD official 
in exile who denounced Wehner, Heinrich Mayer 
(codenamed MOST), was executed; another, Erich 
Birkenhauer (BELFORT), was sentenced to twelve years 
in the gulag. A third denunciation, by MIRRA, a female 
NKVD agent among the German Communists, almost led 
to Wehner’s downfall. She reported that Wehner’s 



behavior appeared to indicate that he was “in contact with 
the Gestapo.” On December 15, 1937, Wehner (then 
known as Herbert Funk) was summoned to NKVD 
headquarters for questioning. A subsequent note on his 
file records that he was to be given the impression that he 
was being recruited as an NKVD agent but that the real 
purpose was to gather evidence against him in preparation 
for his arrest. In 1938, the former secretary of the Berlin- 
Brandenburg KPD district committee, Theodor Beutming, 
confessed to being a member, with Wehner, of a (non- 
existent) “underground German Trotskyist center” in 
Moscow. On July 22 Yezhov, the NKVD chief, wrote on 
Beutming ’s confession, “Where is the memorandum on 
the arrest of Funk?” A memorandum sent to Yezhov 
shortly afterwards listed a series of German Communists 
who had identified Wehner, under NKVD interrogation, 
as a Gestapo agent. 

Wehner seems to have been saved from execution only 
by the winding down of the Terror and the disgrace, a few 
months later, of Yezhov. Early in 1940 Comintern sent 
him to carry out “illegal work” in Sweden, using identity 
documents in the name of H. M. Komelis. In June 1941, 
shortly before Hitler’s attack on the Soviet Union, the 
Centre once again considered Wehner as possible NKVD 
agent material. It was decided not to recruit him, however, 
when it was discovered that he had included in a report of 
the previous October an accurate but politically incorrect 
warning that an attack by Nazi Germany on the Soviet 



Union was, sooner or later, inevitable. Wehner was later 
arrested by the Swedish police and — according to later 
claims by Markus Wolf — revealed the names of members 
of the Communist underground in both Sweden and 
Germany. On emerging from prison Wehner broke 
away from the Communists and made common cause 
with the SDP. 

Wolf found the post-war Wehner “a person of 
irreconcilable contradictions.” Though playing a major 
role in turning the SDP from a Marxist into a social 
democratic party, Wehner remained nostalgic for his 
Communist roots. In 1973 he had an “intensely 
emotional” reunion with Ulbricht’s successor, Erich 
Honecker, with whom he had worked as a young 
Communist in the Saarland almost half a century earlier. 
Honecker went to enormous pains to arrange the details of 
the reunion, trying to ensure that a cake prepared for tea at 
a hunting lodge tasted exactly like one baked for Wehner 
many years before by Honecker’ s mother. After 
Wehner ’s death in 1990, Honecker claimed that, although 
he had rejected Communism, “his goal was still the union 
of the labor movement and the building of a socialist 
German republic. 

According to Wolf, secret contacts with Wehner began 
in the mid-1950s but were initially regarded with great 
suspicion by Ulbricht, who absurdly suspected him of 
being “a British spy.” Contact became easier when 



Wehner became Minister for All-German Affairs in 1966 
and began regular meetings with the East German lawyer 
Wolfgang Vogel, who negotiated on “humanitarian 
questions” with West German officials. Vogel took his 
instructions directly from Erich Mielke, the GDR Minister 
of State Security, and reported to him after each meeting 
with Wehner. According to Wolf: 

Mielke alone edited the reports on conversations 
with Wehner for passing on to Honecker. Since 
drafting was not his strong point, he often locked 
himself in his room for a whole day to put the 
Wehner reports into the proper form. Hardly 
anything in the GDR was more secret than these 
reports. Apart from the three copies for Honecker, 
Mielke and myself, there was also a re-edited and 
censored version of the reports which was sent to our 
Soviet colleagues. 

Mielke boasted to the Centre that Wehner ’s regular 
briefings gave the Stasi a direct line to the heart of the 
West German power structure. Mitrokhin’s notes 
contain none of these briefings. They do include, 
however, one example from KGB files of the trust placed 
in Wehner as a “confidential contact.” He was informed 
in 1973 — apparently before the news became public — that 
the editor of the weekly magazine Quick, Heinz Van 
Nouhuys (codenamed NANT), who had been recruited as 



an HVA agent, was in fact a double agent working for the 
BfV.99 

Brandt later concluded that Wehner had been 
negotiating with the GDR behind his back.^^^ It is 
unlikely, however, that Wehner ever consciously betrayed 
what he saw as the interests of the FRG. “From his youth 
onwards,” Wolf argued, “he regarded conspiracy as an 
instrument of power politics and sometimes physical 
survival. From his first contacts with us ... he no doubt 
felt that he was always the stronger party in the political 
game.”^^^ 

Though the KGB appears to have left the running of 
Wienand entirely to the HVA and never regarded Wehner 
as more than a “confidential contact,” during the 1970s it 
had a hitherto unknown agent, codenamed CARDINAL, 
an SDP official who had been talent- spotted by another 
KGB agent, MAVR, a West German film-maker. The 
intelligence provided by CARDINAL included reports on 
FRG politicians and industrialists, the issues to be raised 
by Brandt during his visit to Moscow in 1973, Brandt’s 
resignation in 1974, the subsequent state of the SDP 
leadership and FRG relations with China, Israel and 
Portugal. As well as being rewarded with an icon and 
other gifts, CARDINAL was paid 5,000 dollars in 1974, 
the same sum in 1976 and 11,635 deutschmarks in 1977. 
Then the doubts began. A detailed study of his 
“intelligence” by the Centre revealed nothing of 



significance which had not also appeared in the West 
German press — apart from some items which the KGB 
suspected were disinformation. It was concluded that 
CARDINAL and MAVR had been seeking to ingratiate 
themselves with the KGB in the hope of gaining its 
assistance in winning valuable contracts in the Soviet 
Union. Contact with both was abruptly broken off.^^^ 
Mitrokhin’s notes on KGB attempts to penetrate the 
Christian Democrats (CDU) are thinner than those on the 
SDP. He does, however, identify two agents within the 
CDU, both recruited in 1972; SHTOLPEN, a party 
adviser, and RADIS T, a member of the West Berlin 
city assembly. No details are available on the 
intelligence which they provided. Mitrokhin also 
identifies a leading member of the Free Democrats (FDP), 
codenamed MARK, who had been recruited as a Soviet 
agent in East Germany in 1946 on the basis of what were 
alleged to be “compromising circumstances” arising from 
his wartime service in the Wehrmacht. A few years later 
MARK succeeded in fleeing to the West, where he 
rapidly embarked on a new career as a politician. In 1956 
the KGB resumed contact with him and remained in touch 
for the next twenty- four years. However, there is no 
evidence that during that time MARK supplied any 
significant intelligence. A later Centre assessment 
concluded that he had passed on information slanted in 
favor of the political interests of the FDP and had tried to 



use his contacts with the East to further his own career. In 
about 1975 one of MARK’S parliamentary colleagues told 
Aleksandr Demyanovich Zakharov, a KGB officer 
stationed in Karlshorst, that MARK’S earlier association 
with Soviet intelligence had been “a youthful error.” In 
1980 the Centre finally decided that there was no point in 
remaining in contact with him.^^^ 

Both the recycled newspaper stories provided by 
CARDINAL and the quarter century wasted in trying to 
extract intelligence from MARK provide further evidence 
of the limitations of the KGB’s political intelligence 
analysis. Mitrokhin records one occasion on which 
Andropov issued what amounted to an official rebuke for 
the poor quality of FCD assessments on the FRG. In 
October 1977, as part of the preparations for Brezhnev’s 
state visit to West Germany in the following year, 
Kryuchkov submitted an alarmist report on the likely 
security problems, claiming that no fewer than 250 
terrorist and extremist groups in the FRG were capable of 
attempting the assassination of the Soviet leader. 
Andropov replied acerbically: 

Comrade [V. I.] Kevorkov [of the Second Chief 
Directorate], who has just returned from the FRG, 
gives a different account of the situation. You should 
synchronize your watches, as for us this is not a 
trivial matter. 



In the event, Kevorkov’s less alarmist assessment proved 
correct and Brezhnev’s visit in May 1978 passed off 
without incident. 

MITROKHIN’S INFORMATION ON the KGB’s West 
German agents, though extensive, is not comprehensive. 
There is, for example, intriguing evidence in the files seen 
by Mitrokhin of a KGB agent in the entourage of Egon 
Bahr, one of Helmut Schmidt’s most trusted advisers and 
a leading architect of Ostpolitik. (There is no suggestion 
that the agent was Bahr himself.) On February 5, 1981 
Andropov sent Brezhnev and the CPSU Central 
Committee an intelligence report (no. 259-A/OV ), 
marked “of special importance,” which recounted a 
telephone conversation on January 27 between Schmidt 
and Ronald Reagan, whose inauguration as president of 
the United States had taken place a week earlier, and gave 
details of Schmidt’s subsequent discussions with Bahr 
and other advisers. To Schmidt’s irritation, Reagan asked 
for a month’s delay to the chancellor’s visit to 
Washington, previously arranged for March 3, on the 
grounds that the President was not yet ready “for a serious 
discussion of foreign policy problems.” Schmidt told his 
advisers that this was a deliberate delaying tactic by the 
new Reagan administration “designed to enable 
Washington to gain time to build up its armaments with 
the aim of overtaking the USSR in the military field.” 

The KGB source also reported complaints by Schmidt 



to Bahr and others that Bonn was flooded with specialists 
sent by Washington with the aim of halting the growth of 
commercial contacts between West Germany and the 
Soviet Union. Schmidt rightly believed that the Reagan 
administration was out to torpedo the negotiations 
between Bonn and Moscow on the construction of 
pipelines to bring natural gas from Siberia to the FRG, 
which Washington feared would make West Germany 
dangerously dependent on Soviet energy supplies. 
Moscow was doubtless delighted by Schmidt’s intention 
to press ahead with the negotiations as quickly as possible 
in order to present Reagan with a fait accompli. 

The reliability of the KGB’s German source was 
authenticated in the report sent to Brezhnev and the 
Central Committee both by Andropov and by Lieutenant- 
General Kevorkov, then head of the Seventh Department 
of the KGB Second Chief Directorate (SCD).^^^ 
Kevorkov’s involvement indicates that the source was 
recruited and controlled not by the FCD but by the SCD, 
perhaps after being compromised during a visit or posting 
to Moscow (a characteristic form of SCD blackmail). 

Despite some lack of enthusiasm for Schmidt, both the 
Soviet and East German leadership were anxious to 
prevent a return to power by the Christian Democrats. 
According to a KGB file, Honecker secretly made known 
to the Schmidt government in 1978 that East Germany 
was willing to take action designed to improve the SDP’s 



apparently declining electoral prospects — for example, by 
easing travel restrictions between the GDR and FRG.^^^ 
There is no evidence of any response from the SDP. 

Moscow’s particular bete noire was the charismatic, 

right-wing Bavarian CSU leader, Franz-Josef Strauss, 

who was chosen as the candidate of the CDU and its CSU 

allies for the chancellorship in the 1980 elections. 

According to the minutes of a meeting in Moscow in July 

1979 between Andropov and Mielke, the GDR interior 

minister and head of the Stasi, “It was acknowledged that 

Strauss was a serious opponent to Schmidt at the 

Bundestag elections in 1980. It was therefore essential to 

compromise Strauss and his supporters.”^ Among the 

KGB active measures agreed by Andropov and Mielke 

was operation COBRA-2, which used information 

gathered by an HVA agent, Inge Goliath, former secretary 

to the head of the main CDU foreign affairs think tank, to 

fabricate sinister links between the CDU/CSU leadership 

and right-wing elements in the intelligence agencies. A 

total of 1,587 copies of a booklet alleging that BND 

officers had conspired with the opposition against the 

Schmidt government were circulated to politicians, trade 

union leaders and other opinion-formers in the FRG. 

According to the KGB file on COBRA-2, some of the 

disinformation in the booklet reappeared in the West 

German press and caused Schmidt to order a judicial 
113 

enquiry. 



The KGB, which had a recurrent tendency to 
exaggerate the success of its active measures in reports to 
the Politburo, claimed that COBRA-2 had caused great 
alarm in the CDU/CSU leadership and had “a positive 
influence” in ensuring an SDP victory at the 1980 
Bundestag elections.^ Though, in reality, Strauss’s 
election defeat probably owed little — if anything — to 
Soviet and East German active measures, it undoubtedly 
came as a considerable relief to the Centre. When the SDP 
finally fell from power in 1983, the new government was 
headed not by Strauss but by the less flamboyant Helmut 
Kohl. 

The main aim of KGB active measures during the early 
1980s was the attempt to exploit the opposition of the 
large and militant West German peace movement to the 
deployment of US medium-range missiles in the FRG. 
Among the most eloquent opponents of the deployment 
was the Bilrgermeister of Saarbrucken, Oskar Lafontaine, 
later an unsuccessful SDP candidate for the 
chancellorship (and in 1998 briefly a controversial finance 
minister in the government of Gerhard Schrider). It would 
have been wholly out of character had the Centre, which 
only a few years earlier had formed absurdly unrealistic 
plans to recruit Harold Wilson and Cyrus Vance, not also 
targeted Lafontaine. In 1981 the operations officer, L. S. 
Bratus, was sent to cultivate him and — ^predictably — 
failed in the attempt. The KGB seems, none the less, to 
have tried to take a largely undeserved share of the credit 



for the decision by an SDP congress eight months after its 
1983 election defeat to oppose the stationing of US 
medium-range missiles on German soil. A CPSU Central 
Committee document in 1984 claimed complacently, 
“Many arguments that had previously been presented by 
us to the representatives of the SDP have now been taken 
over by them.”^^^ 

As in other NATO countries, the chief priority of 
intelligence collection in the FRG during the early 1980s 
was operation RYAN — the fruitless attempt to discover 
non-existent Western preparations for a nuclear first strike 
against the Soviet Union. Markus Wolf and, no doubt, 
some KGB officers in Karlshorst and West German 
residencies regarded the whole operation as utterly 
misconceived. None, however, dared to challenge the 
paranoid mindset of the Centre. Wolf found his Soviet 
contacts “obsessed” with RYAN and the threat of a 
NATO nuclear first strike: 

The HVA was ordered to uncover any Western plans 
for such a surprise attack, and we formed a special 
staff and situation center, as well as emergency 
command centers, to do this. The personnel had to 
undergo military training and participate in alarm 
drills. Like most intelligence people, I found these 
war games a burdensome waste of time, but these 
orders were no more open to discussion than other 
orders from above. 



Because S&T collection was less distorted by 
misconceptions of the West than political intelligence, its 
quality was probably higher. Kryuchkov wrote in a 
directive to residencies in July 1977: 

Work against West Germany is assuming an 
increasingly greater importance at the present time in 
connection with the growth of the economic 
potential of the FRG and the increase in its influence 
in the solution of important international issues. 

The Federal Republic of Germany is both 
economically and militarily the leading West 
European capitalist country. It is the main strategic 
bridgehead of NATO, where a significant 
concentration of the adversary’s military strength can 
be observed: the total numerical strength of the 
forces of the Western allies (including the 
Bundeswehr) reaches almost a million in the country. 
This situation distinguishes the FRG from the other 
European capitalist states and makes it the most 
important component of the military bloc. Within the 
FRG, military scientific research studies in the fields 
of atomic energy, aviation, rocket construction, 
electronics, chemistry and biology are being 
intensively pursued. ^ ^ ^ 


As Kryuchkov’s directive indicates. West Germany, 



though ranked far behind the United States, had become 
the chief European target for Line X (S&T) operations. In 
1980, 61.5 percent of the S&T received by the Military 
Industrial Commission ( VPK) came from American 
sources (not all in the United States), 10.5 percent from 
the FRG, 8 percent from France, 7.5 percent from Britain 
and 3 percent from Japan. Just over half the intelligence 
acquired by FCD Directorate T in 1980 (possibly an 
exceptional year) came from allied intelligence services, 
the HVA and Czechoslovak StB chief among them.^^^ 
Among Directorate T’s chief targets in the FRG was 
Germany’s largest electronics company, Siemens, whose 
scientists and engineers included the KGB illegal 
RICHARD, recruited in East Germany, and at least two 
other Soviet agents: HELMUT and KARL.^^^ 
HELMUT was unaware that he was a KGB agent and 
believed that he was working for the HVA.^^^ 

As in the case of other Western companies, it proved 
easier to collect S&T from Siemens than to exploit it in 
the Soviet Union, particularly in the civilian economy. 
The Centre’s paranoid tendencies made it increasingly 
fearful that the Siemens computers it purloined had been 
bugged or otherwise tampered with. The FCD’s Fifteenth 
Department (Registry and Archives) planned to use a 
Siemens computer to store the information on its card 
files on three million people. Because of the Centre’s fear 
that the computer contained some hidden bug which 



Soviet experts had failed to detect, however, it remained 
unused in a storeroom for five years. Less advanced 
East German computers were eventually used instead. 

As well as benefiting from the HVA’s extensive S&T 
operations in the FRG, the KGB’s own Line X agents 
spanned almost the whole of West German high 
technology. In addition to those in Siemens, Mitrokhin’s 
notes identify twenty-nine other agents of varying 
importance, some of them working for such major firms 
as Bayer, Dynamit Nobel, Messerschmitt and Thyssen.^^^ 

The great majority of these espionage cases never came 
to court. One of the few which did was that of Manfred 
Rotsch (EMIL), who was betrayed by a French agent in 
Directorate As head of the planning department in 
the FRG’s largest arms manufacturer, Messerschmitt — 
Bilkow — Blohm (MBB), Rotsch betrayed many of the 
secrets of NATO’s new fighter bomber, the Tornado 
(built by MMB jointly with British and Italian 
manufacturers), the Milan anti-tank missile and the Hot 
and Roland surface-to-air missiles. Rotsch was a highly 
professional well-trained spy, communicating with his 
controllers by microdot messages. His cover too was 
impeccable. While living an apparently conventional 
family life of almost tedious tranquility in a Munich 
suburb, he joined the conservative Christian Social Union 
and stood as a CSU candidate in Bavarian local 
elections. Mitrokhin’s brief note on EMIL indicates 



that he had already been recruited by the KGB before he 
left East Germany, ostensibly as a refugee, in 1954.^^^ 
Rotsch thus may well have been the longest- serving KGB 
agent planted in the FRG with East German assistance. 
Arrested in 1984, he was sentenced in 1986 to eight and a 
half years’ imprisonment but exchanged a year later for an 
East Berlin doctor serving a long prison term of solitary 
confinement. Though housed with his wife in a luxury 
East German lakeside villa, Rotsch had grown attached to 
his life in the West. Within a few months, both returned to 
their house near Munich and a frosty welcome from their 
scandalized neighbors. 

STASI AND HVA offices were full of busts of Lenin and 
Dzerzhinsky, commemorative plaques embellished with 
the sword and shield of the Cheka and other trinkets 
presented at convivial gatherings of GDR and Soviet 
intelligence officers at which operational successes 
against the FRG such as the East German Manfred 
Rotsch’ s thirty years as a KGB agent were celebrated and 
toasts were drunk to the future. After the fall of the Berlin 
Wall in November 1989, however, the near 40-year 
collaboration between HVA and KGB, the most 
successful (though characteristically rather one-sided) 
intelligence alliance in the Soviet Bloc, ended in East 
German charges of betrayal by Moscow. Most appeals for 
help to the Centre after the collapse of the GDR by former 
HVA officers and agents who feared prosecution in the 



West were met by an embarrassed silence from the KGB. 
On October 22, 1990 Wolf wrote to Gorbachev: 

We were your friends. We wear a lot of your 
decorations on our breasts. We were said to have 
made a great contribution to your security. Now, in 
our hour of need, I assume that you will not deny us 
your help. 

Gorbachev, however, did precisely that. Wolf appealed to 
him to insist on an amnesty for the Stasi and its foreign 
intelligence service before agreeing to German 
reunification. Gorbachev refused. “It was,” says Wolf 
bitterly, “the Soviets’ ultimate betrayal of their East 
German friends, whose work for over four decades had 
strengthened Soviet influence in Europe.” 



TWENTY - SEVEN 


FRANCE AND ITALY DURING THE 

COLD WAR 


Agent Penetration and Active Measures 


For much, probably most, of the Cold War, the Paris 
residency ran more agents — usually about fifty plus — 
than any other KGB station in western Europe. Its most 
remarkable achievement during the Fourth Republic 
(1946-58) was the penetration of the French intelligence 
community, especially SDECE, the foreign intelligence 
agency. An incomplete list in KGB files of the 
residency’s particularly “valuable agents” in 1953 
included four officials in the SDECE (codenamed 
NOSENKO, SHIROKOV, KORABLEV and 
DUBRAVIN) and one each in the domestic security 
service DST (GORYACHEV), the Renseignements 
Generaux (GIZ), the foreign ministry (IZVEKOV), the 



defense ministry (LAVROV), the naval ministry 
(PIZHO), the New Zealand embassy (LONG) and the 
press (ZHIGALOV).^ In 1954 30 per cent of all reports to 
the Centre from the Paris residency were based on 
information from its agents in the French intelligence 
community.^ 

The basis for Soviet penetration of France during the 
Cold War had been laid at the end of the Second World 
War. Thanks both to the leading role played by the 
Communist Party in the French Resistance and the 
presence of Communist ministers in government until 
1947, the few years after the Liberation had been a golden 
age for agent recruitment.^ Though the British and 
American intelligence communities were probably 
unaware of the identities of most Soviet agents in France, 
they were acutely conscious of the weakness of post-war 
French security and — for that reason — cautious about 
exchanging classified information with the SDECE and 
the DST. A 1948 assessment by the British Joint 
Intelligence Committee (JIC), infused by a somewhat 
absurd sense of ethnic superiority, blamed the success of 
Soviet penetration on “inherent defects in the French 
character” as well as “the wide appeal of Communism in 
France.” Soviet intelligence, the JIC concluded, was able 
to exploit: 

a. A natural garrulous tendency in the French 
character which makes the temptation to pass on 



“hot” information, albeit in strictest confidence,” 
almost irresistible. 

b. A lack of “security consciousness” which 
leads to carelessness and insufficient precautions to 
guard classified documents. 

c. A certain decline in moral standards in 
France, which, together with extremely low rates of 
pay, must contribute to the temptation to “sell” 
information . . 

The JIC’s supreme confidence in the inherent superiority 
of British over Gallic security was, presumably, at least 
slightly deflated three years later by the defection of 
Burgess and Maclean, Philby’s recall from Washington 
and the suspicion which fell on Blunt and Caimcross. 

After the compromise of the British Magnificent Five 
in 1951, France became for the remainder of the decade 
the KGB’s most productive source of intelligence on 
Western policy to the Soviet Bloc.^ The KGB defectors 
Vladimir and Evdokia Petrov reported in 1954 that the 
Centre “found intelligence work particularly easy in 
France . . . The French operational section was littered 
with what looked like photostat copies of original French 
documents.”^ The Paris residency obtained important 
intelligence on Western negotiating positions before both 
the Berlin Conference early in 1954, the first between 
Soviet, American, British and French foreign ministers 
since 1949, and the Geneva four-power summit in July 



1955, the first meeting of heads of government since the 
meeting of the Big Three at Potsdam ten years before.^ 
Thanks to the diplomatic ciphers provided by JOUR, a 
cipher clerk in the Quai d’Orsay recruited in 1945, the 
Centre also seems to have had access to plentiful French 
SIGINT. In 1957 JOUR was awarded the Order of the 
Red Star.^ It was probably largely thanks to JOUR that 
during the Cuban missile crisis, the KGB was able to 
supply the Kremlin with verbatim copies of diplomatic 
traffic between the Quai d’Orsay and its embassies in 
Moscow and Washington.^ 

During the early Cold War, the Paris residency also 
appears to have been the most successful promoter of 
active measures designed to influence Western opinion 
and opinion- formers. Between 1947 and 1955 the 
residency sponsored a series of bogus memoirs and other 
propagandist works, among them: J'ai choisi la potence (I 
Chose the Gallows) by General Andrei Vlasov, who had 
fought with the Germans on the eastern front; the equally 
fraudulent Ma carridre O I’etat-major sovietique (My 
Career in the Soviet High Command) by “Ivan Krylov;” 
and bogus correspondence between Stalin and Tito, 
published in the weekly magazine Carrefour, in which 
Tito confessed to being a Trotskyist. The main author of 
the forgeries was Grigori Besedovsky, a former Soviet 
diplomat who had settled in Paris. Some of Besedovsky’ s 
fabrications, which also included two books about Stalin 



by a non-existent nephew, were sophisticated enough to 
deceive even such a celebrated Soviet scholar as E. H. 
Carr, who in 1955 contributed a foreword to Notes for a 
Journal, fraudulently attributed to the former foreign 
commissar Maksim Litvinov. The resident in Paris from 
1946 to 1948, Ivan Ivanovich Agayants, who had 
launched the Besedovsky frauds, was later appointed head 
of the FCD’s first specialized disinformation section. 
Department D (subsequently Service A), founded in 
1959 .''’ 

The post-war Paris residency also had what was, in 
effect, its own weekly newspaper, focusing on 
international relations: La Tribune des Nations 

r 

(codenamed ECOLE). Founded in 1946 by Andre 
Ulmann with the help of Soviet subsidies, the Tribune'^ 
subscribers included both French government 
departments and foreign embassies. Publicly, Ulmann 
disclaimed any connection with the French Communist 
Party (PCF). According to his friend Pierre Daix: 

There was nothing Stalinist about him. He did not 
even seem like a Communist. He was a progressive 
intellectual, but without any of the utopian or 
idealistic nonsense associated with this expression. 
His feet were firmly on the ground. 

Ulmann’ s KGB file, however, reveals that he was a secret 
member of the PCF. Recommended by the Party 



leadership to the Paris residency, he had been recruited as 
agent DURANT in 1946. From 1948 onwards Ulmann 
also worked as an agent of the Polish intelligence service, 
which gave him the codename YULI and provided 
monthly subsidies of 200,000 francs to help finance the 
publication of La Tribune des Nations}^ Between 1946 
and his death in 1970, Ulmann received a total of 
3,552,100 francs from the Paris residency, as well as an 
(unidentified) Soviet decoration for his work for the 
KGB.^^ To at least some Paris journalists, however, 
Ulmann ’s cover was somewhat transparent. The historian 
of the PCF, Annie Kriegel, herself a former militante, 
recalls hearing Ulmann being described by one of her 
friends as “a secret agent disguised as a secret agent.” 

Despite the Paris residency’s successes during the 
1950s, the Centre was dissatisfied with the number of its 
new recruits. It took Moscow some years to accept that, 
following the end of Communist participation in 
government in 1947, the pace of subsequent agent 
recruitment was bound to be slower. In a despatch to the 
Paris residency on February 3, 1954, the Centre insisted 
that it step up its campaign to acquire new agents in the 
foreign ministry, the cabinet secretariat, the SDECE, the 
DST, the general staffs Deuxiame Bureau, the armed 
forces and NATO. “The residency,” it complained, “is 
living on its old capital and is not taking energetic 
measures to acquire new, valuable sources of 



information.”^^ 

In 1955 the Paris residency recruited a major new agent 
inside NATO, codenamed GERMAIN, who was 
controlled by an (unidentified) illegal despatched from the 
Centre. GERMAIN, like JOUR, was later awarded the 
Order of the Red Star. His wife NINA trained as a KGB 
radio operator and was given the medal “For combat 
services.” In 1956 a residency agent, DROZDOV, 
reported that one of his wife’s friends, ROZA, who 
worked at SDECE headquarters, had become pregnant 
after a one-night stand with “a chance acquaintance.” On 
instructions from the residency, DROZDOV gave ROZA 
financial help after the birth of her daughter in the 
following year in the hope of laying the basis for an 
eventual recruitment. ROZA’s cultivation, however, 
proceeded slowly. By 1961 the residency had concluded 
that she would rebuff any direct attempt to turn her into a 
KGB agent, and decided instead on a false flag 
recruitment. DROZDOV successfully persuaded her to 
provide regular intelligence reports to assist a fictitious 
“progressive organization” of which he claimed to be a 
member. Other French recruits during the early years of 
the Fifth Republic, established in January 1959 under the 
presidency of General Charles de Gaulle, included two 
cipher clerks (FARIONOV^^ and SIDOROV^^), two 
Paris police officers (FRENE^^ and DACHNIK^^) and 
two young scientists (ADAM^^ and SASHA^^). In 1964, 



like his fellow cipher clerk JOUR seven years earlier, 
SIDOROV was awarded the Order of the Red Star^^ — a 
further indication of the success of KGB SIGINT 
operations in decrypting French diplomatic traffic. 

The French embassy in Moscow was also a major KGB 
target. During the early 1960s both the ambassador, 
Maurice Dejean, and the air attache. Colonel Louis 
Guibaud, were seduced by KGB swallows after elaborate 
“honeytrap” operations directed by the head of the Second 
Chief Directorate, Oleg Mikhailovich Gribanov, with the 
personal approval of Khrushchev. Dejean was beaten up 
by a KGB officer posing as the enraged husband of the 
swallow, a Moscow ballerina who had seduced him. 
Guibaud was confronted with the usual compromising 
photographs of his sexual liaison. Both seductions, 
however, failed as intelligence operations. In 1962 
Guibaud shot himself with his service revolver. The 
following year, a defector revealed Gribanov’s plan to 
compromise Dejean, who was recalled to Paris before 
serious KGB blackmail had begun. De Gaulle welcomed 
the ambassador home with the now celebrated reproof, 
“Alors, Dejean, on couche!”^^ The KGB files noted by 
Mitrokhin reveal for the first time that a third French 
diplomat in Moscow was successfully targeted by 
Gribanov. A female member of the embassy staff, 
codenamed LOUISA, was seduced by a male swallow, 
confronted with photographs of her seduction and 
persuaded to work as a Soviet agent. Once back in Paris 



in the early 1960s, however, she broke off contact with 
the KGB .27 

The most successful French recruitment in Moscow 
recorded in the files seen by Mitrokhin was that of the 
businessman Franaois Saar-Demichel (codenamed NN) in 
the 1960s.^^ After fighting in the Resistance, Saar- 
Demichel had served briefly in the DGER and its 
successor, the SDECE, before leaving in 1947 to begin a 
business career. In 1954 he won an exclusive, and 
lucrative, contract to import Soviet wood pulp for French 
paper manufacture. A year later, during a visit to 
Moscow, he was recruited by the SCD as a KGB agent. 
Acting on instructions from the Centre, Saar-Demichel 
used his Resistance connections to make contact with 
some of de Gaulle’s leading supporters and contributed 
almost 15 million francs to the Gaullist cause during the 
final years of the Fourth Republic.^^ 

After the change of regime and de Gaulle’s election as 
President of the Republic, Saar-Demichel succeeded in 
gaining an entree to the elysee and supplied regular 
reports on his meetings with Soviet leaders during 
business trips to Moscow. According to Constantin 
Melnik, security adviser to the first prime minister of the 
Fifth Republic, Michel Debre, “More than any other 
political movement, Gaullism was swarming with agents 
of influence of the obliging KGB, whom we never 
succeeded in keeping away from de Gaulle.” The most 



important of them may well have been Saar-Demichel. 
His reports were designed by the Centre to reinforce de 
Gaulle’s belief that Soviet leaders were guided not by 
Communist ideology but by traditional Russian interests, 
and to persuade him that they were genuinely anxious for 
an understanding with France: 

My Soviet interlocutors [nowadays] make much less 
use of Marxist-Leninist phraseology . . . They are 
very open to dialogue and make a clear distinction 
between propaganda statements and discussions 
based on precise facts . . . The dead weight of 
ideology is fading away, particularly among the new 
generation. Faced with this transformation of public 
opinion, the leadership is making no attempt to put a 
stop to it.^^ 

During his visits to Moscow, Saar-Demichel also 
provided the Centre with regular reports on de Gaulle’s 
foreign policy. He claimed that after the signature of the 
cooperation treaty between France and West Germany in 
January 1963, which had been badly received in Moscow, 
de Gaulle had said privately, “We extended our hand to 
the Germans so that we could at least be sure they were 
not holding a knife in theirs.”^ ^ 

AS WELL AS collecting intelligence, the Paris residency 
continued to be energetically engaged in active measures. 



In its annual report for 1961, the residency proudly 
reported that it had been responsible for inspiring 230 
articles in the press, 11 books and pamphlets, 32 
parliamentary questions and statements, 9 public meetings 
and the circulation of 14,000 copies of 10 posters and 
flysheets.^^ In addition to Andre Ulmann (DURANT), 
editor of La Tribune des Nations , the residency’s agents 
of influence included at least two socialist politicians, 
GILBERT and DROM.^^ GILBERT (later GILES), who 
was reported to be “close” to the future president, 
Franaois Mitterrand, was recruited by the Czechoslovak 
StB in 1955 under the codename ROTER. KGB contacts 
with GILBERT began a year later.^^ DROM was first 
cultivated by the KGB in 1959, recruited as an agent in 
1961 and paid a monthly retainer of 1,500 francs for the 
next twelve years.^^ 

The Paris residency’s most ambitious active measure 
during de Gaulle’s decade as President of the Fifth 
Republic was to fund a new news agency, the Centre 
d’ Information Scientifique, Economique et Politique, 
founded in 1961 by Pierre-Charles Pathe, a newly 
recruited KGB agent codenamed PECHERIN (later 
MASON). The journalist son of the millionaire film 
magnate who had founded Pathe newsreels, he had first 
come to the residency’s attention two years earlier after 
publishing a naively pro- Soviet Essai sur le phenomdne 
sovietique: 



The cruelties of Stalinism were only childhood 
illnesses. The victory of the Soviet Union is that of a 
correct vision of the march of history. The USSR, 
this laboratory of new ideas for the most advanced 
development of society, will overtake the gigantism 
of the United States. 

From 1961 to 1967 the KGB paid Pathe 6,000 francs a 
month to publish a weekly newsletter (codenamed 
OBZOR) from his center, which was sold by subscription 
but sent free of charge to opinion-formers in politics, 
business, journalism and diplomacy.^^ 

The main purpose of the active measures implemented 
by Pathe and the Paris residency’s other agents of 
influence during the early Fifth Republic was to damage 
Franco- American relations, encourage a Franco-Soviet 
rapprochement and distance France from NATO.^^ Saar- 
Demichel reported progress on all three fronts. His finest 
hour as a KGB agent came during a visit to Moscow to 
negotiate the sale of the French SEC AM color system to 
Soviet television in March 1965, when he told his 
controller that de Gaulle wished to visit the Soviet Union 
in the following year. De Gaulle, he claimed, attached no 
importance to Franco-Soviet ideological differences and 
had told him: 


Russia was, is, and would continue to be a great 
power in Europe. The outstanding qualities of the 



Russian people remained the same whatever the 
ideology of the Communist government, but at the 
present time Communist ideology acted as a bond 
which held together this vast multinational 
federation. However, it was not ideology but reasons 
of state which played the main role. 

As for the reunification of Germany, to which the Soviet 
Union was resolutely opposed, de Gaulle wished to 
postpone it as long as possible: “The later, the better.” A 
doubtless exultant Centre passed on Saar-DemicheTs 
message to the Central Committee. 

It remains unclear whether, as the KGB believed, the 
elysee had asked Saar-Demichel to sound out Moscow on 
the question of a state visit — or whether, knowing de 
Gaulle’s wishes, he took the initiative himself. The 
Centre, however, claimed much of the credit for de 
Gaulle’s decision to distance France from NATO and 
improve relations with the Soviet Union.^^ In March 1966 
France withdrew from the integrated NATO command. 
Three months later de Gaulle made a triumphal state visit 
to the Soviet Union. The KGB had, in reality, little 
influence on either decision. Ever since the United States 
and Britain had rejected his proposal early in the Fifth 
Republic to join with France in a three-power directorate 
at the head of NATO, de Gaulle had been increasingly 
inclined to distance himself from it. His attempt to use the 
Soviet Union as a counterweight to American influence in 



Europe went back to his wartime years as leader of the 
Free French, when Roosevelt and Churchill had failed to 
treat him as an equal. “Ah, Monsieur le Secretaire 
General,” he told Brezhnev during his visit to Moscow, 
“how happy we are to have you to help us resist American 
pressure — just as we are pleased to have the United States 
to help us resist pressure from the Soviet Union!” But if — 
contrary to the private boasts of the Centre — KGB active 
measures did not determine de Gaulle’s foreign policy, 
they played at least a minor role in reinforcing his 
conviction that the Soviet Union was a traditional great 
power with an increasingly thin Communist veneer. His 
report to the French cabinet on his state visit to Russia 
concurred with the views expressed by Saar-Demichel. 
The Soviet Union, de Gaulle declared, was “evolving 
from ideology to technocracy: 

I did not talk to anyone who told me, “I am a 
Communist militant or a party leader” ... If one 
leaves aside their propaganda statements, they are 
conducting a peaceful [foreign] policy.^ ^ 

KGB active measures may have had a somewhat 
greater, though doubtless not decisive, influence on the 
evolution of French public opinion. According to opinion 
polls after de Gaulle’s state visit, 35 percent of French 
people held a favorable opinion of the Soviet Union (as 
compared with 25 percent two years earlier) while only 13 



percent were hostile. Those with favorable opinions of the 
United States fell, partly as a consequence of the Vietnam 
War, from 52 percent in 1964 to only 22 percent at the 
beginning of 1967.^^ 

After the apparent successes of the previous few years, 
the Paris residency saw little purpose in continuing to 
fund Pathe’s Centre dTnformation Scientifique, 
Economique et Politique, on which it had spent 436,000 
francs since 1961. The center closed and its newsletter 
ceased publication. Pathe continued, however, to work as 
an agent of influence, writing regular articles in national 
newspapers under the pseudonym “Charles Morand.” 
From January 1967 to June 1979, he received a total of 
218,400 francs in salary, plus 68,423 francs for expenses 
and bonuses.^^ In 1969 Pathe was one of the organizers of 
the Gaullist-dominated Mouvement pour ITndependance 
de T Europe, which the Centre regarded as a potentially 
valuable means of destabilizing NATO.^^ 

KGB PENETRATION OF the French intelligence 
community continued during the 1960s. Mitrokhin’s notes 
record that at least four French intelligence officers and 
one former head of department in the Snrete Generate 
were active KGB agents during the period 1963-6, but 
give few details.^^ In the years after de Gaulle’s 
resignation in 1969, the quality, though not the quantity, 
of the KGB’s French recruits seems to have declined. The 



total number of agents run by the Paris residency rose 
from 48 in 1971 to 55 in 1974; in 1974 the residency also 
had 17 confidential contacts. However, the files seen by 
Mitrokhin contain no indication that the 1974 agents 
included any senior civil servants or intelligence officers. 
The KGB had also lost the services of DROM, one of its 
two leading agents within the Socialist Party. In 1973 he 
was given “substantial funds” to pay off his debts. Shortly 
afterwards, however, DROM was reported to be in 
contact with the DST.^^ 

The best indication of the main strengths of the KGB’s 
French agent network in the mid-1970s is a list of thirteen 
“valuable agents” of the Paris residency who, with 
Andropov’s personal approval, were given substantial 
New Year gifts in 1973, 1974 and 1975. In each of these 
three years JOUR was given a bonus of 4,000 francs; 
ANDRE, BROK and FYODOR received 3,000 francs; 
ARGUS, DRAGUN, DZHELIB and LAURENT 2,000 
francs; NANT and REM 1,500 francs; BUKIN-IST, 
MARS and TUR 1,000 francs.^^ Two reservations need to 
be registered about this list. First, it does not include the 
residency’s most important S&T agent, ALAN, who was 
paid on a different bonus system.^^ (The same may apply 
to some other Line X agents.) Secondly, three of the 
agents who received the New Year bonuses were foreign 
officials stationed in Paris who provided intelligence 
chiefly on non-French matters. DZHELIB was a staff 



member of an Asian embassy, who provided ciphers and 
other classified documents;^^ REM was a Canadian in the 
Paris headquarters of UNESCO, who acted as an agent- 
recruiter;^^ BUKINIST worked in a Middle Eastern 
embassy.^^ The eleven French recruits selected for New 
Year gifts in 1973-5 do, however, give an important 
insight into the Centre’s and Paris residency’s perception 
of their main French assets. 

The most highly rated French agent in the mid-1970s 
was also the longest-serving: JOUR, the cipher clerk in 
the Foreign Ministry (codenamed EFITA) recruited thirty 
years earlier, who was singled out for the largest bonus. 
During the period 1968-73 he provided intelligence on the 
cipher machines in the French embassy in Moscow and at 
NATO headquarters which enabled the Sixteenth 
(SIGINT) Directorate to decrypt a probably substantial 
amount of diplomatic traffic. In 1973 JOUR was posted to 
a French embassy abroad, where contact with him was 
maintained through dead letter-boxes.^^ Intelligence 
provided by JOUR probably assisted the bugging of the 
new teleprinters installed in the Moscow embassy 
between October 1976 and February 1977. All, 
remarkably, were left unguarded for forty-eight hours 
during their journey by rail to Moscow. The bugs secretly 
fitted to the teleprinters during this period transmitted to 
the KGB the unenciphered text of all incoming and 
outgoing embassy telegrams for over six years. The 



head of the bugging operation, Igor Vasilovich Maslow, 
was awarded the Order of Lenin and later promoted to 
head the Sixteenth (SIGINT) Directorate.^^ 

Until 1983, thanks to JOUR and Maslov, the Centre 
had far better information on French policy to the Soviet 
Union than that of any of France’s NATO allies. JOUR 
simultaneously continued to talent- spot other Foreign 
Ministry cipher and secretarial personnel. In 1978-9 he 
cultivated “L” (identified only as a member of the 
ministry “support staff’), obtained his private address, 
carried out a background check on his home and 
facilitated his recruitment by a residency operations 
officer.^^ During the period 1978-82 no less than six 
cipher personnel at the Quai d’Orsay were under active 
KGB cultivation.^^ 

A majority of the most highly rated French agents in 
the mid-1970s (six of the ten who received New Year 
bonuses in 1973-5: ANDRE,^^ BROK,^^ ARGUS,^^ 
NANT,^^ MARS^^ and TUR^^) were journalists or 
involved with the press: a clear indication that, whatever 
the real effectiveness of KGB disinformation campaigns 
against French targets, the Centre regarded active 
measures as one of the main strengths of the Paris 
residency. Of the three other most valuable French agents, 
FYODOR held a major position in a foreign policy 
institute and provided documents on the USA, NATO and 
China;^^ LAURENT was a scientist in a NATO 



aeronautical research institute and DRAGUN was a 
businessman and agent-recruiter. LAURENT and 
DRAGUN were probably Line X (S&T) agents. Pathe 
(MASON), one of the leading agents of influence in the 
1960s, had declined in importance and did not figure on 
the list of most valuable agents in 1973-5. His career, 
however, was to revive during the second half of the 
decade. 

The Centre’s probably exaggerated confidence in the 
agents of influence run by the PR Line of the Paris 
residency led it to undertake an ambitious series of active 
measures throughout the 1970s. According to KGB files, 
ANDRE, a senior journalist, “had access to President 
Georges Pompidou,” who had succeeded de Gaulle in 
1969, and to some of his senior ministers, including Pierre 
Messmer, who became prime minister in 1972, and 
Foreign Minister Maurice Schumann. Reports from the 
Paris residency claimed that ANDRE was used to pass to 
Pompidou’s office “slanted information” calculated to 
increase the President’s suspicion of the United States. 

In this, as in most influence operations, it is difficult to 

r 

estimate the level of success. Given ANDRE ’s access to 
the highest levels of the Pompidou administration, it is 
difficult to believe that he was simply ignored. It is 
equally difficult to credit, however, that he had more than 
— at best — a marginal influence on French foreign policy. 
The Centre’s reports to the Central Committee tended to 



claim more credit than it probably deserved for 
provoking, or worsening, tension within the Atlantic 
Alliance. 

The limitations of KGB active measures in influencing 
French policy were clearly illustrated by the failure of the 
LA MANCHE (“English Channel”) operation, designed 
to sow distrust between Pompidou and the British prime 
minister, Edward Heath, to persuade the President to 
maintain de Gaulle’s veto on British entry into the 
European Community.^^ 

Though the journalist ARGUS appears to have had no 
direct access to Pompidou, he was in even closer contact 

r 

than ANDRE with Messmer. According to reports from 
the Paris residency he had regular discussions with the 
Prime Minister during the campaign for the March 1973 
general election and continued to advise him afterwards. 
The main aim of the KGB disinformation channeled 
through ARGUS was to damage the electoral prospects of 
the Gaullist-led ruling coalition by sowing distrust 
between the Gaullists and their allies. ARGUS falsely 
alleged to Messmer that Michel Poniatowski, general 
secretary of the Independent Republicans, and the 
Reformist Jean- Jacques Servan-Schreiber had secretly 
agreed to cooperate in undermining the position of 
Gaullist candidates. On KGB instructions, ARGUS also 
planted similar disinformation in the press. Other active 
measures devised by Service A to damage “Atlanticisf ’ 
(pro-American) candidates included planting false reports 



that the campaigns of Servan-Schreiber and the Christian 
Democrat leader, Jean Lecanuet, were being financed by 
American money. In Servan-Schreiber’s constituency of 
Meurtheet-Moselle, letters were posted to local notables 
purporting to come from a neo-Nazi group in the FRG 
which called on all those “with German blood flowing in 
their veins” to vote for Servan-Schreiber.^^ While such 
operations may well have impressed the Centre, it is 
difficult to believe that they had a significant influence on 
French voters. Though the vote of the left increased at the 
general election, the Gaullist-led coalition retained a 
comfortable majority of seats. 

Having greatly exaggerated its success in 1973, the 
Centre was also confident of its ability to influence the 
outcome of the May 1974 presidential election. It 
informed the Central Committee that the Socialist leader, 
Franaois Mitterrand, standing as the candidate of all the 
main left-wing parties, had a real chance of victory,^ ^ and 
mounted a major active measures campaign against his 
chief right-wing opponent, Valery Giscard d’Estaing 
(codenamed KROT — “Mole”). In one week during the 
campaign, ten officers of the Paris residency Line PR 
carried out fifty-six allegedly “significant operational 
measures. 

A leading part in the active measures against Giscard 
was taken by one of the residency’s most highly rated and 
longest- serving agents, BROK, then a well-connected 



journalist. Originally recruited as an ideological agent in 
1946, BROK had begun working for money within a few 
years to supplement his income as a journalist and to 
purchase a Paris apartment. In the mid-1970s he was paid 
over 100,000 francs a year.^^ As well as having a total of 
at least ten case officers,^^ BROK was so highly regarded 
that he had meetings with five heads of the FCD Fifth 
Department, whose responsibilities included operations in 
France. During the 1974 presidential election campaign, 
BROK was provided, on Andropov’s personal 
instructions, with a fabricated copy of supposedly secret 
campaign advice given to Giscard d’Estaing by the 
Americans on ways to defeat Mitterrand and Jacques 
Chaban-Delmas, Giscard’ s unsuccessful Gaullist rival for 
the right-wing vote during the first round of the election. 
The forged document was then shown to Chaban-Delmas 
and others, doubtless to try to make collaboration between 
him and Giscard more difficult at the second round, when 
Giscard was the sole candidate of the right. 

The only other operation to discredit Giscard d’Estaing 
during the 1974 presidential election which is described in 
detail in Mitrokhin’s notes was a somewhat bizarre active 
measure which reflected the obsession of the KGB’s 
many conspiracy theorists with Zionist intrigues. In 
France, as in the United States and elsewhere, the Centre 
believed that a powerful Jewish lobby was at work behind 
the scenes, manipulating much of the political process. 



The KGB decided to exploit the murder of a female 
relative of Giscard d’Estaing in October 1973 to mount an 
extraordinary operation designed to embroil him with the 
Jewish lobby. Service A concocted a forged document 
supposedly distributed by a (non-existent) French pro- 
Israeli group, claiming that she had been killed by 
Zionists in revenge for Giscard’ s part in the prosecution 
of Jewish financiers while serving as finance minister 
some years earlier. The Centre was unaccountably proud 
of the whole absurd operation. In the second round of 
the presidential election, Giscard defeated Mitterrand by 
less than 2 percent of the vote. There is no evidence that 
KGB active measures had the slightest influence on the 
result. 

IN THE MID-1970S Le Monde (codenamed VESTNIK 
— “Messenger” — ^by the KGB)^^ became embroiled in a 
controversy over its alleged left-wing, anti-American bias. 
The most distinguished of its leading conservative critics, 
Raymond Aron, contrasted Le Monde' ^ readiness to 
mention US bombing raids on North Vietnam in the same 
breath as Nazi wartime atrocities with its reluctance to 
engage in serious, detailed criticism of Soviet abuses of 
human rights. Solzhenitsyn, whose Gulag Archipelago 
provided the best-documented evidence of those abuses, 
received particularly unfair treatment. In July 1975 Le 
Monde used a distorted account of a speech by 



Solzhenitsyn in the United States to smear him as a Nazi 
sympathizer: 

Alexander Solzhenitsyn regrets that the West joined 
forces with the USSR against Nazi Germany during 
the last world war. 

He is not alone. Westerners of a previous 
generation like [the leading French collaborator] 
Pierre Laval had the same ideas, and people like [the 
French fascists] Doriot and Beat welcomed the Nazis 
as liberators. 

Two months later, Le Monde reported — also inaccurately 
— that Solzhenitsyn had accepted an invitation to visit 
Chile from the brutal military dictatorship of General 
Pinochet. There is no proof that either of these smears 
was planted by the KGB. Both, however, were entirely in 
line with disinformation which the KGB was seeking to 
plant on the Western press. In 1976 a former member of 
Le Monde' s editorial staff, Michel Legris, published a 
detailed analysis of what he claimed was its equally 
biased reporting in favor of the Portuguese Communists, 
the Cambodian Khmer Rouge and the Palestinian PLO.^^ 
The extent of bias in Le Monde reporting during the 
1970s still remains controversial, as do claims that it was 
far readier to condemn American than Soviet policy. 
KGB files, however, provide some support for the charges 
of pro-Soviet bias made by Le Monde' ^ critics. 



Mitrokhin’s brief notes on KGB contacts with Le Monde 
identify two senior journalists and several contributors 
who were used, in most cases doubtless unwittingly, to 
disseminate KGB disinformation.^^ During the 1970s and 
early 1980s the Paris residency claimed to have 
influenced Le Monde articles on, inter alia, US policy in 
Iran, Latin America, the US bicentennial, the dangers of 
American influence in Europe, the threat of a 
supranational Europe, US plans for the neutron bomb, 
causes of East- West tension and the war in Afghanistan.^^ 
In July 1981 Andropov received a message from the 
leadership of the French Communist Party, urging him to 
arrange for an invitation to visit Afghanistan to be sent to 
a named journalist on Le Monde, whose reporting, it 
claimed, would be “sympathetic.”^^ Some years earlier 
the same journalist had been generous in his praise of 
Colonel Muhammar Qaddafi. Le Monde' ^ susceptibility 
to KGB disinformation probably derived chiefly from 
naivety about Soviet intelligence operations. In the 
aftermath of Watergate and the revelations of abuses by 
the US intelligence community, Le Monde showed itself 
— like some other sections of the media — acutely aware 
of the sins, real and imagined, of the CIA but curiously 
blind to the extensive active measures program of the 
KGB. 

Unlike Le Monde, the main news agency, Agence 
France-Presse, attracted little public controversy. It was. 



however, successfully penetrated both in Paris and 
abroad. Mitrokhin’s notes identify six agents^^ and two 
confidential contacts^ ^ in the agency recruited between 
1956 and 1980. The most senior, LAN, was recruited 
under false flag by the businessman DRAGUN in 1969 
and paid 1,500 francs a month, which he was told came 
from the Italian company Olivetti, supposedly anxious to 
have inside information on French government policy.^^ 
Perhaps the most ambitious active measure begun by 
the KGB during the presidency of Giscard d’Estaing was 
the launching of the fortnightly newsletter Synthesis 
(codenamed CACTUS) by its agent of influence Pierre- 
Charles Pathe (MASON). The first issue of Synthesis, 
ostensibly left-wing Gaullist in tone, appeared in June 
1976 and was sent free of charge to 500 opinion- 
formers,^^ among them 70 percent of the Chamber of 
Deputies, 47 percent of the Senate and 41 journalists.^^ 
The seventy issues published over the next three years, at 
a cost to the KGB of 252,000 francs,^^ covered a series of 
well-worn Service A themes. France was portrayed as the 
victim of an “underhanded” American economic war in 
which the US balance of payments deficit allowed 
Washington to act as a parasite on the wealth of other 
states. 

Giscard d’Estaing was portrayed as an “Atlanticisf’ who 
was failing to protect French interests against American 
exploitation. The United States was a sinister “police 



democracy” which employed systematic violence against 
its black minority and all others who stood in its way. The 
assassination of President Kennedy was “an essential 
aspect of American democracy.” By contrast, Pol Pot’s 
massacres were either played down or explained away 
and the Vietnamese boat people dismissed as middle-class 
emigrant s.^^ 

Pathe’s downfall began in 1978 when the DST started 
tailing his case officer at the Paris residency, Igor 
Aleksandrovich Sakharovsky (alias “Kuznetsov”), son of 
a former head of the FCD. After Sakharovsky reported his 
suspicions that he was being followed to his superiors, his 
meetings with Pathe were temporarily suspended. When 
they resumed two months later, Sakharovsky 
inadvertently led his watchers to Pathe. On July 5, 1979 
the radio-intercept post in the Paris residency, while 
listening into a frequency used by a DST surveillance 
team, heard its leader announce, “The actors are in place. 
Let’s start the show!” Immediately afterwards Pathe was 
arrested in the act of receiving money and documents 
from Sakharovsky.^^ In May 1980 Pathe became the only 
Soviet agent of influence ever convicted in a Western 
court. He was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment but 
was released in 1981. During his trial Pathe admitted to 
having received small sums of money for articles written 
on Moscow’s behalf His KGB file reveals that, in reality, 
by the time of his arrest he had received a total of 974,823 



francs in salary and expenses. 

At almost the same time as the Synthesis active 
measure came to an ignominious end, the Paris residency 
took the decision to cease funding La Tribune des 
Nations, founded by its agent Andre Ulmann (DURANT) 
in 1946. Since Ulmann’ s death in 1970, further KGB 
subsidies to the Tribune, totaling 1,527,500 francs by 
1978, had been channeled through agent NANT, a former 
associate of Ulmann. In the mid-1970s NANT was 
considered one of the residency’s dozen most valuable 
agents, providing intelligence obtained from his contacts 
in official circles as well as carrying out active measures. 
According to his file, from 1970 to 1978 he supplied 119 
intelligence reports, published 78 articles on topics 
devised by Service A and helped to cultivate 12 potential 
agents. In the late 1970s, however, the KGB began to 
suspect him of “dishonesty” and of being in contact with 
the DST. Contact with NANT was broken off in 1980. 
Thus ended the longest and most expensive active 
measures operation ever run by the Paris residency. The 
KGB files on DURANT, NANT and three agents closely 
associated with them— VERONIQUE, JACQUELINE 
and NANCY — fill 26 volumes, totaling over 8,000 
pages. 

Each year the Paris residency, like other KGB stations 
abroad, sent the Centre somewhat crude statistics on its 
active measures. Those for 1979 totaled 188 articles in the 
press (despite the demise of Synthesis), 67 “influence 



conversations;” 19 operations to convey disinformation 
by word of mouth; 7 operations involving forged 
documents ; the organization of 2 public meetings; 4 
speeches at public gatherings; 2 books; and 4 leaflets. 

In 1980, largely as a result of the breach with NANT, the 
number of press articles for which the Paris residency 
claimed the credit fell to 99. “Influence conversations,” 
however, increased to 79 and operations to convey 
disinformation verbally to 59. The residency also reported 
two active measures involving forged documents, and 
claimed the credit for organizing two public meetings, 
inspiring sixteen conference speeches and arranging one 
leaflet distribution. 

If Paris residency reports are to be taken literally, the 
“influence conversations” achieved some striking 
successes. Several leading French politicians from across 
the political spectrum as well as a few well-known 
academics, whom it would be unfair to name, are said to 
have adopted views on the threat posed by American 
defense policy, the future of East- West relations and the 
menace to French national sovereignty from a 
“supranational Europe.” Some of these individuals may 
well have been imprudent in their contacts with 
individuals from the Soviet embassy whom they might 
reasonably have suspected were KGB officers. It seems 
probable, however, that in many instances the Paris 
residency merely claimed the credit for policy statements 
which were relatively favorable to Soviet positions but 



which it had, in reality, done little to influence. Among 
the residency’s more absurd claims was the boast that 
KGB active measures “compelled” two of de Gaulle’s 
former prime ministers, Michel Debre and Maurice Couve 
de Murville, the latter the current head of the Foreign 
Affairs Commission in the National Assembly, to “defend 
France’s independence from the United States” — a policy 
to which both were already committed. Though the KGB 
also claimed to have brought influence to bear on close 
advisers of the President, Giscard d’Estaing, the Prime 
Minister, Raymond Barre, the Foreign Minister, Jean 
Franaois-Poncet, and the Socialist leader, Franaois 
Mitterrand, this supposed “influence” had no discernible 
effect on their policies. 

KGB policy during the 1981 presidential election 
campaign was less clear-cut than during the election 
seven years earlier. At the end of the 1970s the left-wing 
alliance including both Socialists and Communists, which 
had supported Mitterrand in 1974, had broken down, and 
on the first round of the election he had to face opposition 
from the PCF leader, Georges Marchais, as well as from 
candidates of the right. Though KGB active measures in 
1981 reflected greater hostility to Giscard d’Estaing and 
the candidates of the right than to Mitterrand, they were 
no longer, as in 1974, guided by the simple strategy of 
securing a Mitterrand victory. (It was clear from the 
outset that Marchais, who won only 15 percent of the 
vote, had no chance of winning the election.) The 



individual active measures recorded in the files noted by 
Mitrokhin suggest that bringing pressure on all the 
leading candidates was considered a more important 
objective than ensuring the victory of any one of them. As 
in 1974, however, the Centre seriously exaggerated its 
ability to influence the course of events. 

In May 1980, Giscard d’Estaing had become the first 
Western leader to hold talks with Brezhnev since the 
Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, thus helping to rescue the 
Soviet Union from its pariah status in the West. In 
preparing for the meeting, Brezhnev’s advisers must have 
been greatly assisted in their continuing access to all the 
diplomatic traffic exchanged between Paris and the 
French embassy in Moscow. On Giscard’ s return to Paris, 
he announced, perhaps somewhat naively, that the Soviet 
Union had agreed to withdraw one of its divisions from 
Afghanistan. Though Giscard’s attitude to the Soviet 
Union subsequently appeared to harden, the Paris 
residency embarked on active measures designed to 
persuade him that he would increase his chances of 
reelection by presenting himself as “the advocate of 
dialogue with [eastern Europe] against American 
domination.” Disinformation was sent to a member of 
Giscard’s staff which it was hoped would convince him 
that the most damaging scandal of his presidency, that of 
the diamonds given him by “Emperor” Jean Bedel 
Bokassa of the Central African Republic, had been 
engineered by the CIA.^^^ The residency also claimed the 



credit for “inciting” attacks by the unofficial Gaullist 
candidate, Michel Debre, on alleged “departures from 
Gaullist principles” and pro-American tendencies on the 
part of the official Gaullist candidate, Jacques Chirac. 
Other active measures included schemes “to expose pro- 
Atlantic and pro-Israeli elements” in the policies of 
Mitterrand and one of his future prime ministers, Michel 
Rocard.^^^ 

According to an opinion poll during the campaign, 53 
percent of Jewish electors intended to vote for Mitterrand 
as compared with only 23 percent for Giscard d’Estaing. 

The KGB was predictably suspicious of Mitterrand’s 
popularity with Jewish voters. As in 1974 the active 
measures devised by Service A reflected the KGB’s anti- 
Zionist conspiracy theories, in particular its belief in the 
power of the French Jewish lobby. The most absurd of the 
residency’s operations during the election was probably 
its attempt to “compromise the Zionists” by passing bogus 
information to the French authorities purporting to show 
that they were planning “extremist measures” to disrupt 
the campaigns of Giscard d’Estaing and Debre. It is 
highly unlikely that this or any other active measure had 
any significant influence either on the main candidates or 
on the outcome of the presidential election. 

Mitterrand’s success in May 1981 was followed by a 
landslide Socialist victory in the legislative elections a 
month later. Though the career of the veteran Socialist 



Party agent GILES, recruited a quarter of a century 
earlier, was by then almost over, he remained in touch 
with his case officer, Valentin Antonovich Sidak 
(codenamed RYZHOV), who was stationed in Paris from 
1978 to 1983 under diplomatic cover as second secretary 
at the Soviet embassy. He continued to provide Sidak 
with what the Centre considered inside information from 
“the close entourage of F[ran9ois] Mitterrand. 

The arrest of Pathe in 1979 and the decision to break 
off contact with NANT in 1980 caused a major change of 
strategy in KGB active measures to influence the French 
press after Mitterrand’s election as president in May 
1981. An unusually frank enquiry by the FCD Fifth 
Department concluded — ^probably correctly — that 

Synthesis, La Tribune des Nations and other periodicals 
funded by the KGB had had “practically no influence on 
public opinion.” In future the Paris residency was 
instructed to concentrate on the cheaper and more 
productive task of acquiring agents in established 
newspapers and magazines. The value of some of its 
existing media agents, however, was called into question 
— among them BROK, probably the KGB’s longest- 
serving journalist recruit. During the 1970s BROK had 
been one of the best-paid and most highly regarded 
French agents. A subsequent review of his work 
concluded, however, that he was “insincere, untruthful in 
his contacts with operational officers, exaggerating his 
information and operational possibilities, inflating the 



value of his information, and developing mercenary 
tendencies, lack of discipline and failure to carry out 
assignments.” In 1981 BROK’s 35-year service as a 
Soviet agent was abruptly terminated. The Centre 
continued to seek new agents among French journalists, 
but concluded that, in a television age, the Western press 
lacked the influence on public opinion which it had 
possessed twenty years earlier. ^ ^ ^ 

AT THE BEGINNING of the 1980s, partly as a result of 
the KGB’s declining confidence in its Paris agents of 
influence, the Centre probably regarded S&T as the most 
successful part of its French operations. By the mid-1970s 
(if not sooner), the Paris residency had twice as many 
Line X officers and agents (over twenty of each) as any 
other residency in the European Community. Line X 
operations continued to expand during the late 1970s and 
— ^probably — the early 1980s. S&T documents sent to the 
Centre (835 in 1973, 829 in 1974, 675 in 1975) rose to a 
record 1,021 in the first half of 1977.^^^ A total of 36 Line 
X officers served in Paris for all or part of the period 1974 
to 1979, far more once again than in any other EC 
country. By 1980, if not before, France had become the 
KGB’s third most productive source of S&T, providing 8 
percent of all S&T received by the Soviet Military 
Industrial Commission (VPK).^^^ 

The most important and best-paid French S&T agent 



during the 1970s identified in the files noted by Mitrokhin 
was ALAN (also codenamed FLINT and TELON), an 
employee of a defense contractor (codenamed 
AVANTGARDE). ALAN was a walk-in. In 1972 he went 
to the Paris embassy, explained that he was earning 7,000 
francs a month, needed extra money to buy a house 
(possibly a second home) in the 150,000-200,000 francs 
price range and was willing to sell his firm’s secrets. Over 
the next six years he provided technical documentation 
and parts of missile guidance systems, laser weapons, 
detection systems for high-speed low-flying targets and 
infrared night-vision equipment for tanks, helicopters and 
other uses. ALAN’s file records that his S&T “fully met 
the requirements of the highest authorities [Politburo].”^ 

In December 1974 his controller, Boris Federovich 
Kesarev, a Line X officer at the Paris residency, was 
recommended for the Order of the Red Star in a citation 
signed personally by Andropov. ALAN was paid over 
200,000 francs a year,^^^ but was dismissed by his firm in 

1978 on suspicion of passing its secrets to a Western 
intelligence service. The KGB appears to have escaped 
suspicion. 

Apart from ALAN’s intelligence, the French S&T most 
highly rated by the Centre probably concerned France’s 
Ariane rocket and its fuel, Cryogdne.™ From 1974 to 

1979 a French engineer, Pierre Bourdiol, recruited by the 
KGB in 1970, was employed on the Ariane project by 



SNIAS, the predecessor of the state-owned aerospace 
group Aerospatiale. Probably in 1979 or 1980, agent 
KARL, a specialist in electromagnetism, succeeded in 
obtaining further intelligence on Ariane from an 
unidentified subsource. KARL was paid a salary of about 

150.000 francs a year and received bonuses of over 

30.000 francs in 1979 and 1980.^^2 ^932 KARL 

recruited NIKE, another highly rated Line X agent, who 
worked in one of the laboratories of the Centre National 
de Recherches Scientifiques. NIKE was enlisted under 
false flag, believing he was in the pay of a foreign firm. 
His file records that his information “satisfied priority 
requirements” of Directorate 

Just as Line X operations in France reached their 
apogee in the early 1980s, they were compromised by a 
French agent inside Directorate T, Vladimir Ippolitovich 
Vetrov (codenamed FAREWELL), who had been 
stationed at the Paris residency from 1965 to 1970. Vetrov 
was an ardent Francophile, deeply disillusioned with the 
Soviet system, and resentful at his treatment by 
Directorate T which had transferred him from operations 
to analysis. In the spring of 1981 he sent a message, via a 
French businessman returning from Moscow, to the DST 
headquarters in Paris, offering his services as a spy. Over 
the next year Vetrov supplied over 4,000 documents on 
Soviet S&T collection and analysis. The FAREWELL 
operation came to an abrupt end after a brutally bizarre 



episode in a Moscow park in February 1982 whose 
explanation still remains unclear. While drinking — and 
probably quarreling — with a KGB secretary with whom 
he was having an affair, Vetrov was approached by a 
KGB colleague. Startled, and perhaps fearing that his 
double life had been discovered, he stabbed his colleague 
to death. When his lover tried to run away, Vetrov 
stabbed her too, probably to prevent her revealing what 
had happened, but she survived to give evidence against 
him. Though Vetrov began a twelve-year sentence for 
murder at Irkurksk prison in the autumn of 1981, it was 
several months before the KGB began to suspect that he 
was also guilty of espionage. Vetrov wrote his own death 
sentence with a confession which concluded, “My only 
regret is that I was not able to cause more damage to the 
Soviet Union and render more service to France. 

Vetrov’s documents added enormously to Western 
intelligence services’ knowledge of Soviet S&T 
operations. In July 1981, two months after he became 
president, Franaois Mitterrand personally informed 
Ronald Reagan of the documents being received from 
FAREWELL. Soon afterwards, Marcel Chalet, the head 
of the DST, visited Washington to brief Vice-President 
George Bush, a former Director of Central Intelligence, in 
greater detail. The first public disclosure of Vetrov’s 
material followed the discovery early in 1983 that bugs in 
the teleprinters of the French embassy in Moscow had 
been relaying incoming and outgoing telegrams to the 



KGB for the previous seven years. Mitterrand responded 
by ordering the expulsion from France on April 5, 1983 of 
forty-seven Soviet intelligence officers — the largest such 
exodus since operation FOOT in Britain twelve years 
earlier. Many of those expelled, in particular the Line X 
officers, had been identified by Vetrov. When the Soviet 
ambassador, Yuli Vorontsev, arrived at the Quai d’Orsay 
to deliver an official protest. Foreign Minister Claude 
Cheysson reduced him to silence by producing one of the 
KGB documents on S&T operations supplied by 
Vetrov. 

THOUGH THE KGB residency in Rome ran less than 
half as many agents as its counterpart in Paris (just over 
twenty in the mid-1970s as compared to about fifty in 
France), the pattern of agent recruitment in the two 
countries was broadly similar. Immediately after the 
Second World War Soviet intelligence succeeded, with 
the assistance of the Communist Party leadership, in 
penetrating a number of major ministries in both Italy and 
France. By the 1970s, however, a majority of the best- 
paid Line PR agents run by the Rome and Paris 
residencies were journalists rather than civil servants. 

As in France, the post-war popularity of the 
Communist Party and the brief period of Communist 
participation in government created the best opportunities 
Soviet intelligence was ever to enjoy in Italy for agent 



penetration. Like JOUR, probably the most important 
of the post-war French recruits, DARIO, the longest- 
serving and probably the most valuable Italian agent, 
worked in the foreign ministry, where he had recruited his 
first three female agents before the Second World War. 
On his return to the ministry after the war, he recruited 
two more female typists: TOPO (later renamed LED A), 
whom he married, and NIKOL (later INGA).^^^ 

For most of the next three decades DARIO was 
instrumental in obtaining a phenomenal amount of 
classified foreign ministry material. During the mid- 
1950s he succeeded in recruiting three further female 
agents: VENETSIANKA, who was on the staff of the 
Italian embassy in Paris; OVOD, on whom Mitrokhin’s 
notes provide no further information; and SUZA, who 
worked for the diplomatic adviser to President Giovanni 
Gronchi and gained access to a wide variety of 
ambassadors’ reports and other classified foreign ministry 
documents. During the early 1960s DARIO ’s wife 
LEDA met her case officer from the Rome residency once 
a week in cinemas and other locations in the city. As she 
shook hands with him, she passed over a microfilm of the 
classified foreign ministry documents she had 
photographed during the previous week.^^^ 

In 1968 the Centre decided to put DARIO “on ice,” and 
awarded him a pension for life of 180 hard currency 
roubles a month. Four years later, however, it reactivated 



him in order to cultivate a female cipher officer in a 
foreign embassy and another typist at the Italian foreign 
ministry, who appears to have been given the codename 
MARA.^^^ In March 1975, forty-three years after 
DARIO ’s recruitment, he and his wife were awarded the 
Order of the Red Star. He subsequently collected his 
pension at regular intervals by traveling abroad either to 
the Soviet Union or to some other country. 

After the Second World War the Rome residency also 
successfully penetrated the interior ministry, thanks 
chiefly to DEMID, a ministry official recruited in 1945 
who acted as agent-recruiter. DEMID’s first major 
cultivation inside the ministry was a cipher clerk 
codenamed QUESTOR, who agreed to supply 
information on the contents of the classified telegrams 
which he enciphered and deciphered. QUESTOR, 
however, believed for several years that his information 
was being passed by DEMID not to Soviet intelligence 
but to the PCI, and refused to hand over the ciphers 
themselves. Late in 1953 the Rome residency decided to 
force the pace and instructed DEMID to offer QUESTOR 
100,000 lire for the loan “for a few hours” of the code and 
cipher books used by the ministry. QUESTOR accepted. 
On March 3, 1954 DEMID finally told him that he was 
working not for the PCI but for the KGB, and obtained a 
receipt from him for the 100,000 lire. Soon afterwards 
QUESTOR was handed over to the control of STEPAN, 



an operations officer at the Rome residency, to whom he 
supplied a phenomenal range of official ciphers to which 
he succeeded in gaining access. Among them were those 
of the prefectures, the finance ministry, central and 
regional headquarters of the carabinieri, Italian 
diplomatic missions abroad, the Italian general staff and 
the military-run foreign intelligence service, SIFAR 
(Servizio Informazioni Forze Armate). QUESTOR also 
obtained interior ministry lists of Italian Communists, 
foreign nationals and others who were under surveillance 
by the Police security service (Pubblica Sicurezza)P^ 

The Centre considered its penetration of the Italian 
interior ministry to be so important that in 1955 it handed 
over control of it to a newly established illegal residency 
in Rome, headed by YEFRAT (“Euphrates”). YEFRAT 
was Ashot Abgarovich Akopyan, a 40-year-old Armenian 
from Baku who had assumed the identity of a live double, 
Oganes Saradzhyan, a Lebanese Armenian living in the 
Soviet Union. Like many illegals, he was a gifted linguist, 
fluent — according to his file — in Arabic, Armenian, 
Bulgarian, French, Italian, Romanian and Turkish. His 
wife, Kira Viktorovna Chertenko, an ethnic Russian from 
Baku, was also an illegal, codenamed TANYA. YEFRAT 
and TANYA began their careers as illegals in Romania in 
1948, obtained Italian visas by bribery and moved to 
Rome where they acquired passports in the name of 
Saradzhyan from the Lebanese embassy. YEFRAT’ s 
original mission was to prepare the establishment of a 



new illegal residency in Iran, but in 1952 he and his wife 
were directed to Egypt instead. In 1954 they were recalled 
to Rome where YEFRAT was given 19,500 dollars to 
purchase a business to provide cover for an illegal 
residency. He was not, however, a successful 
businessman; an Italian firm with which he was involved 
went bankrupt. 

YEFRAT ’s residency was given control of DEMID, 
QUESTOR and a third agent in the interior ministry, 
CENSOR, who had probably been recruited by DEMID. 
censor’s greatest coup was to abstract top secret 
documents from the safe of the director general of the 
security service in the ministry. YEFRAT also 
succeeded in renewing contact with a former agent, 
OMAR, who had been sacked from the interior ministry 
cipher department in 1948 and had obtained a job in what 
Mitrokhin’s notes describe as “a service attached to the 
American embassy.” For unexplained reasons, however, 
the quantity of high-grade intelligence produced by the 
agents in the interior ministry declined during the later 
1950s. When exhortations by the Centre and a personal 
meeting between YEFRAT and Lazarev, the head of the 
Illegals Directorate S, failed to produce results, YEFRAT 
was recalled and his illegal residency closed. Control of 
his agents was handed back to the legal Rome 
residency. 



THE ITALIAN EMBASSY in Moscow, like that of 
France, was a major KGB target. Whereas Second Chief 
Directorate operations against French diplomats 
culminated in an embarrassing public scandal, those 
against the Italian embassy achieved spectacular, 
unpublicized success. The weapons used against Italian 
diplomats were the normal stock-in-trade of the SCD: a 
combination of sexual compromise and blackmail. The 
SCD’s first victim was IKAR (“Icarus”), one of the 
service attaches in the Italian embassy who was seduced 
in the late 1950s by a KGB swallow, who then claimed to 
be pregnant and pretended to have an abortion. IKAR was 
confronted by an SCD officer, posing as the swallow’s 
enraged husband and signed a document agreeing to 
become a KGB agent in return for the supposed scandal 
being hushed up. In addition to providing classified 
information, IKAR also gave his SCD controller the 
combination number of his safe and a copy of the cipher 
he used to communicate with Rome. 

IKAR, however, became increasingly anxious at the 
KGB’s hold over him — finally handing his controller a 
rather pathetic letter, promising to continue work as a 
Soviet agent but appealing for the undertaking he had 
signed to be destroyed: 

Beneath your cloak, you are holding a dagger at the 
ready. The day that you trapped me by using 
methods which I regard as unworthy of your highly 



respected nation, I tried to convey to you that my 
attitude to you was friendly. Ignoring these feelings 
of mine, you have subjected me to various tests. 
Despite that, you still doubt my loyalty and my good 
intentions. You continue to hold a gun to my head, 
while uttering words of friendship and appreciation 
towards me. If these feelings of yours correspond 
with reality and are not a mere fiction, then give me 
some proof — that is to say, the question of 
destroying the document concerning the 
circumstances in which I was caught must be 
resolved between us. If you do not do this, I shall no 
longer be able to regard you as worthy of my 
friendship and of my friendly esteem. 

I beg you to understand that I need your respect. 
Therefore, if you think that I am acting under the 
threat of the materials relating to the circumstances 
in which I was caught, you judge me wrongly. Find 
some means of testing my loyalty without threats. I 
believe that I shall not be found wanting. If you 
continue to doubt my sincerity, I shall not be able to 
work while I remain anxious, or continue to respect 
you. 

IKAR was given a copy of his signed undertaking, 
carefully fabricated to look like the original, and 
destroyed it with evident relief in the presence of his 
controller. The original, however, remained in IKAR’s 



file, together with a Russian translation which was later 
transcribed by Mitrokhin.^^^ 

Another member of the Italian embassy staff, 
codenamed PLATON, was also successfully blackmailed 
into becoming a KGB agent after falling victim to the 
same SCD honeytrap. The swallow (codenamed R) 
planted on him by the SCD moved into his Moscow flat, 
then pretended that she was pregnant. PLATON paid for 
her to have a (fictitious) abortion (a criminal act under 
Italian law), was threatened with exposure and agreed to 
become a KGB agent. By the time Mitrokhin saw 
PLATON’S file in 1976, he had left Moscow and a plan 
had been drawn up for Georgi Pavlovich Antonov, an 
Italian- speaking FCD officer formerly stationed in Rome, 
to renew contact with him in Belgium. Whether 
PLATON continued as a KGB agent after 1976 remains 
unknown. 

One senior married Italian diplomat in Moscow was the 
victim of two honeytraps. When first targeted, ENERO 
(also codenamed INSPECTOR) was having an affair with 
a secretary at the French embassy. The SCD concluded 
that he had an insatiable “appetite for women,” selected a 
swallow, agent SUKHOVA, as his maid and secretly 
photographed them making love. During a visit to 
Tashkent, ENERO was seduced by another KGB 
swallow, Diana Georgiyevna Kazachenko, and further 
photographs were taken of their lovemaking. A Russian 
friend of ENERO (who, unknown to ENERO, was a KGB 



officer) then told him that the KGB had come into 
possession of photographs of him in bed with 
SUKHOVA, taken by a criminal gang who were about to 
stand trial, charged with taking compromising 
photographs which they intended to use for blackmail and 
extortion. Almost simultaneously, ENERO was informed 
that Kazachenko’s relatives had lodged an official 
complaint, accusing him of rape and claiming that he had 
made Kazachenko pregnant. Kazachenko, it was claimed, 
was now an invalid as a result of medical complications 
arising from the abortion. 

An SCD operations officer, I.L Kuznetsov, told 
ENERO that the Soviet authorities were prepared to hush 
both matters up if he agreed to “help” them. Though 
ENERO protested that Kuznetsov’s proposal was 
straightforward blackmail, he quickly gave way to it. 
According to his file, the intelligence he provided 
included information that the embassy was illegally 
smuggling into Moscow by diplomatic bag roubles 
purchased abroad at a fraction of the official exchange 
rate. Before leaving Moscow in the early 1970s, ENERO 
agreed to continue work as a KGB agent on his return to 
Italy and was given an initial payment of 500 US dollars. 
Soon afterwards Kusnetsov visited him in Rome to 
introduce his new case officer from the local residency. A 
year later, however, the residency reported that ENERO 
was avoiding meetings with his controller and had 
changed his private address. In 1979 a residency officer 



resumed contact but, since ENERO was now retired and 
in poor health, he was removed from the agent 
network. 

The SCD’s greatest triumph in its operations against 
the Italian embassy in Moscow was the recruitment of a 
senior diplomat, successively codenamed ARTUR and 
ARLEKINO (“Harlequin”). ARTUR was first recruited 
by the Czechoslovak StB in the 1960s, which threatened 
to expose both his affair with a prostitute and his currency 
speculation unless he agreed to cooperate. When he was 
posted to Moscow some years later, control of him was 
transferred by the Czechs to the SCD. ARTUR’ s file 
records that he was rewarded with “valuable presents” 
and all-expenses-paid hunting expeditions in the Moscow 
area. After his return to Italy, ARTUR continued to work 
for the KGB until 1983, several years after his retirement, 
when his muchreduced access to classified information 
led to his removal from the agent network. 

A number of other Italian embassies around the world 
also contained KGB agents: among them DENIS, a cipher 
clerk stationed in the Middle East and recruited in 
1961;^^^ VITTORIO, a former member of the PCI 
recruited in Latin America in 1970;^^^ and 
PLEMYANNIK (“Nephew”), a cipher clerk in the Middle 
East recruited with the help of Bulgarian intelligence in 
1977 146 providing large numbers of 

documents, the KGB’s agents inside the Italian foreign 



ministry and embassies abroad must also have made a 
major contribution to the success of the Sixteenth 
Directorate in decrypting Italian diplomatic telegrams, 
which continued at least until the mid- 1 980s. 
Mitrokhin’s notes provide very few details on the content 
of the remarkable number of diplomatic documents which 
reached the Centre and nothing on the content of the 
decrypts. The implications of the KGB files on Italy and 
France to which he had access are, none the less, very 
great. So great was the Centre’s access to classified 
French and Italian diplomatic traffic that, at numerous 
points during the Cold War, both France and Italy were 
conducting, so far as the Soviet Union was concerned, 
something akin to open diplomacy. 

THOUGH LINE X operations in Italy were on about half 
the scale of those in France, they included some striking 
successes. In 1970 the co-owners of a small high-tech 
company, METIL (“Methyl”) and BUTIL (“Butyl”), 
jointly supplied the KGB with full technical 
documentation on the production of butyl rubber, which 
was used in the construction of the Soviet Sumgait rubber 
factory and led to the redesign of production lines at the 
Nizhnekama Combine and the Kuybyshev Synthetic 
Rubber Works. Directorate T calculated that their S&T 
had produced a saving of 16 million roubles. METIL and 
BUTIL were paid 50,000 dollars. In the mid-1970s 
BUTIL provided other highly rated intelligence, some 



from American sources, on chemical and petrochemical 
148 

processes/^® 

In 1970 the Rome residency had nine Line X officers 
who ran about ten agents, composed chiefly of 
businessmen but including an important minority of 
academics. There was some expansion of S&T 
operations during the later 1970s both in Rome^^^ and in 
Milan, where a senior Line X officer, Anatoli Vasilyevich 
Kuznetsov (codenamed KOLIN), was posted in 1978 
under consular cover. Probably the most important 
Line X agent at the end of the 1970s and beginning of the 
1980s was UCHITEL (“Teacher”), who taught at a major 
university and was controlled by Kuznetsov. Using his 
wide range of academic and business contacts, UCHITEL 
provided S&T from a total of eight major companies and 
research institutes in Italy, West Germany, France and 
Belgium, and carried out other KGB assignments in the 
USA and ERG. UCHITEL ’s most valuable intelligence 
seems to have concerned military aircraft, helicopters, 
aero-engine construction and airborne guidance systems. 
Among the intelligence he supplied was information on 
NATO’s newest combat aircraft, the Tornado, jointly 
developed by Britain, the ERG and Italy. Doubtless 
unknown to UCHITEL, at least one of his university 
colleagues, a nuclear physicist codenamed MARIO, was 
also a KGB agent. Another academic, KARS, who 
operated as a Line X agent in both Italy and the United 



States, also appears to have been based at the same 
university. 

Though Soviet scientists working as KGB agents or co- 
optees used a variety of methods to lure their Western 
colleagues into secret collaboration, they commonly 
promised both money and privileged access to Soviet 
research in their fields. A probably typical example was 
the agreement, dated September 12, 1976, concluded by 
Professor Georgi Nikolayevich Aleksandrov (agent 
AYUN) of the Lenin Polytechnic Institute Imeni Kalinin 
(LPI) with KULON, a senior member of an Italian 
research institute: 

In view of the importance of the exchange of 
scientific and technical information and the 
timeliness of obtaining information on research in 
other countries, LPI on the one hand, in the person of 
its pro-rector for scientific contacts with foreign 
countries, V. A. Serebryannikov, and [the Italian 
research institute] on the other hand, in the person of 
the scientific adviser to its director. Professor 
[KULON], have agreed as follows: 

(1) Professor [KULON] agrees to use his 
own and LPI’s facilities to assist LPI in 
obtaining scientific and technical information 
on basic problems of electronics of an applied 
nature. This scientific and technical information 
should be in the form of reports and articles 



which have not been published in journals, or of 
materials put out by firms on the results of 
studies by firms and scientific institute 
laboratories in the United States, the FRG, 
France, the UK and Japan [Directorate T’s five 
main targets]. If the information is of a 
confidential nature, it will be transmitted to 
LPFs pro-rector or his representative at 
personal meetings, which may be held in one of 
three countries as agreed. The pro-rector’s 
request will be made in the form of a separate 
list. LPI will pay in any currency for 
acquisitions . . . 

(2) For its part LPI undertakes to assist 
Professor [KULON] to publish in closed 
specialized Soviet journals and to arrange for 
invitations for him to the USSR in order to learn 
about other institutions in the USSR and to 
carry out joint studies, and for familiarization 
with major hydroelectric stations and power 
transmission lines. 

Most meetings between KULON and his KGB contacts 
took place in Switzerland. Though KULON seems to 
have remained a confidential contact, similar approaches 
to other Western scientists sometimes led to their 
recruitment as agents. 

S&T operations in Italy suffered a serious setback on 



August 5, 1981 with the unpublicized expulsion of 
probably the most senior Line X officer, Anatoli 
Kuznetsov, which caused inevitable KGB anxiety as to 
whether UCHITEL and his other agents had been detected 
by Italian counterintelligence. An investigation at the 
Centre arrived at three possible explanations for the 
expulsion: that some of Kuznetsov’s Line X operations 
dating from his period at the Paris residency from 1970 to 
1975 had come to light; or that his work as security 
officer for the Soviet colony in northern Italy, which he 
combined with his Line X work, had blown his cover as 
consul in Milan; or that his frequent trips from Milan to 
Turin had aroused suspicion. It does not seem to have 
occurred to the Centre until its investigation of the 
FAREWELL case in 1982 that the leak which led to 
Kuznetsov’s downfall might have come from within 
Directorate T. 

BY THE 1970s a majority of the most highly rated Line 
PR agents run by both the Rome and Paris residencies 
were journalists. One of the files noted by Mitrokhin 
contains a list of the thirteen most highly paid political 
intelligence agents run by the Rome residency at the 
beginning of 1977.^^^ Of the six best-paid, each of whom 
received 240 hard currency roubles a month, at least three 
were journalists: FRANK, recruited in 1966, who held a 
senior position on a major newspaper; POD-VIZHNY 



(“Agile”), also a well-known journalist; and 
STAZHER (“Trainee”), who had been recruited in 1969 
and worked in the Rome bureau of a news agency. The 
other three agents paid 240 roubles a month by the Rome 
residency were DARIO, the veteran agent-recruiter in the 
Foreign Ministry; NEMETS (“German”), a well-known 
left-wing politician; and ORLANDO, who cannot be 
clearly identified from Mitrokhin’s notes. 

The next best-paid agents of the Rome residency at the 
beginning of 1977 were six who received 170 roubles a 
month. No information is available on the occupation of 
one of the six, ACERO; Mitrokhin’s notes reveal his 
identity and indicate that he was probably recruited not 
later than 1969, but give no further details. Of the five 
whose occupations are identified, three — FIDELIO, 
RENATO and MAVR — were journalists. RENATO, 
recruited in 1974, was editor of a periodical. FIDELIO, 
who became an agent in 1975, was director of a press 
agency. MAVR, a left-wing journalist on a leading 
Rome daily recruited some years earlier than RENATO or 
FIDELIO, also acted as agent-recruiter. Among his 
recruits was ARALDO, a civil servant who, according to 
MAVR, regarded the whole Italian political establishment 
as a “den of thieves” and was happy to earn a share of the 
spoils by selling classified documents. 

The other two agents paid 170 roubles a month by the 
Rome residency were LORETO, a (probably 



disillusioned) Maoist militant who provided information 
on China’s contacts with its supporters in the European 
left/^^ and METSENAT (“Patronage”), a corrupt civil 
servant whose motives were assessed as purely 
mercenary. The final codename on the January 1977 
list of the Rome residency’s most valuable agents is that 
of TURIST, a newspaper publisher who was paid 150 
roubles a month. In all, at least seven of the residency’s 
thirteen best-paid recruits, who each received between 
150 and 240 roubles a month, were journalists. As in 
Paris, where a majority of the KGB’s most highly rated 
Line PR agents were also journalists, the Centre’s 
probably exaggerated confidence in their potential as 
agents of influence led it to undertake an ambitious series 
of active measures throughout the 1970s. 

A Centre report on the Rome residency in August 1977 
concluded that it had “an effective and reliable agent 
network” with sources in the foreign ministry, cabinet 
office, defense ministry and the main political parties. 
Each month the residency obtained between 40 and 50 
intelligence reports from its agents. It was, however, 
criticized for its comparative lack of success against 
American, NATO and European Community targets. The 
Centre’s greatest praise was reserved for the residency’s 
influence operations: “[Its] agents coped successfully with 
active measures, including those on a large scale.” During 
1977 operation CRESCENDO, which used forged 



documents to discredit the human rights policy of the 

Carter administration, and operation BONZA, targeted 

against the Chinese, were singled out for particular 
171 

praise/'^ 

The Rome residency’s annual statistics for its active 
measures in 1977 were as follows: 

articles published in the bourgeois press: 43 

materials distributed: 1 

letters drafted: 2 

oral information disseminated: 1 

conversations of influence: 13 

interviews secured: 1 

television appearances: 2 

exhibitions mounted: 1 

parliamentary questions inspired: 2 

appeals inspired: 2^^^ 

Such statistics, of course, mean relatively little unless it 
can be demonstrated that the active measures to which 
they refer had a significant influence on Italian opinion. 
Nowhere in the files examined by Mitrokhin, however, is 
there any sign of a serious, critical assessment of what 
active measures in Italy (or in most other countries) had 
actually achieved. Instead, any sign that Western opinion 
was hostile to any aspect of American policy or 
sympathetic to the Soviet Union was liable to be seized on 
uncritically as evidence of a successful KGB operation. 



Just as it suited the residencies to exaggerate the success 
of their active measures, so it also suited the Centre to 
report these successes to the Politburo. 

AT LEAST HALF the Rome residency’s best-paid Line 
PR Italian agents in January 1977 were either taken off 
the KGB payroll or retired over the next five years. 
The first to go was TURIST. Apparently disillusioned by 
the evidence of Soviet abuses of human rights, TURIST 
made various pretexts for declining to co-operate during 
1977 and by the end of the year had broken contact. 
According to his case officer, he “did not correctly 
understand and interpret the situation of believers and of 
the Church itself in the USSR, or that of dissidents.” In 
other words, TURIST had been alienated by the 
persecution of Soviet religious and political dissidents. An 
examination of TURIST ’s file led Mitrokhin to doubt 
whether he had ever been a fully committed KGB 
agent. 

In 1978 FIDELIO was also removed from the agent 
network after it was discovered that he was in regular 
touch with — and doubtless receiving money from — 
Hungarian intelligence, and had also made contact with 
the Czechoslovak and Polish services. In 1979 DARIO 
retired, followed by METSENAT in the following 
year.^^^ Simultaneously, RENATO and FRANK — like 
TURIST — were becoming disillusioned. RENATO was 



put on ice in 1980, initially for a four-year period; there 
is no evidence as to whether contact with him was 
subsequently resumed. FRANK’S case officer complained 
that he was too easily “influenced by anti-Soviet 
propaganda” following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan 
in December 1979 and the suppression of Solidarity in 
Poland two years later. FRANK was also reported to be 
associated with one of those arrested for involvement with 
the Red Brigades. He was removed from the agent 
network in 1982.^^^ 

The disillusion of FRANK, who a few years earlier had 
been one of the KGB’s most highly paid Italian agents, 
epitomized the problems faced by Service A as it tried to 
devise new influence operations in the early 1980s. 
Though no KGB report dared say so, active measures 
could not possibly repair the damage done to the image of 
the Soviet Union by the invasion of Afghanistan and the 
suppression of Solidarity. 

THE MOST EFFECTIVE of the KGB’s active measures 
during the early and mid-1980s in Italy and France, as in 
western Europe as a whole, were those which exploited 
popular currents of anti-Americanism and the fear of 
nuclear war. Though the first step in the renewed nuclear 
arms race had been the Soviet decision in 1978 to begin 
the deployment of SS20s (a new generation of 
intermediate-range ballistic missiles). Western peace 
movements were far more critical of the subsequent 
decision by NATO to station Pershing II and cruise 



missiles in Europe from 1983. As Mitterrand once drily 
observed, “The missiles are in the East, but the peace 
protests are in the West.” It is reasonable to assume, but 
difficult to prove, that the constant stream of Soviet peace 
propaganda, reinforced by KGB active measures, 
encouraged — even if it did not cause — the 
overconcentration by most Western peace activists on the 
nuclear menace posed by Reagan and his NATO allies 
rather than on that from the Soviet Union. In February 
1984, Kryuchkov reported to a conference of senior FCD 
officers, when reviewing active measures over the 
previous two years: 

Considerable work has been done to provide support 
for unofficial organizations [such as peace 
movements] in a number of countries abroad in their 
struggle against implementation of the American 
administration’s militarist plans. 

The Centre’s confidence that it now possessed a nerve- 
hold on Western public opinion was reflected in the first 
three priorities which it laid down for active measures in 
1984, the year before Gorbachev became Soviet leader: 

• counteracting attempts by the USA and NATO 
to destroy the existing military strategic equilibrium 
and to acquire military superiority over the USSR; 
compromising the aggressive efforts of imperialist 
groups and their plans for preparing a nuclear missile 



war . . . 

• deepening disagreements inside NATO . . . 

• exposing before the international community 
the plans made by the USA to launch a war, its 
refusal to negotiate in good faith with the USSR on 
limiting armaments; stimulating further development 
of the anti-war and antimissile movements in the 
West, involving in them influential political and 
public figures and broad strata of the population, and 
encouraging these movements to take more decisive 
and coordinated action. 

KGB active measures in western Europe were much 
less successful during the Gorbachev era as a result both 
of East- West detente and of glasnost within the Soviet 
Union. By 1987 Gorbachev and his advisers were visibly 
concerned that Western exposure of KGB disinformation 
might take the gloss off the new Soviet image in the West. 
The claim that the AIDS virus had been “manufactured” 
by American biological warfare specialists — one of the 
most successful active measures of the mid-1980s — was 
officially disowned by Moscow, though it continued to 
circulate for several years in the Third World and the 
more gullible sections of the Western media. During the 
later 1980s Soviet front organizations were increasingly 
exposed as frauds. The most important of them, the World 
Peace Council, lost most of its remaining credibility in 
1989 when it admitted that 90 percent of its income came 
from the Soviet Union. 



In September 1990 Kryuchkov acknowledged in an 
“Order of the Chairman of the KGB” that there had been a 
serious decline in the effectiveness of active measures — 
and in the FCD’s faith in them: 

There are very limited opportunities for residencies’ 
access to the mass media in the countries of the 
West, the progress of acquiring new operational sites 
is progressing slowly, and there is an absence of the 
necessary cooperation with the other sections of the 
Soviet KGB and other Soviet ministries and 
agencies. 

Like other members of the KGB old guard, Kryuchkov 
refused to accept that the end of the Cold War implied any 
decline in the importance of active measures either in 
western Europe or elsewhere. That view still appears to 
be well-represented in the senior ranks of the SVR today. 



TWENTY - EIGHT 


THE PENETRATION AND 
PERSECUTION OF THE SOVIET 

CHURCHES 


Though paying lip-service to freedom of religion, the 
Soviet state was the first to attempt to eradicate the 
concept of God. Marx had famously denounced religion 
as “the Opium of the people,” but also spoke with some 
compassion of its role as “the sigh of the oppressed 
creature, the heart of a heartless world.” Lenin’s 
denunciation of religion, however, was 
uncompromisingly venomous: 

Every religious idea, every idea of God, every 
flirting with the idea of God, is unutterable vileness, . 
. . vileness of the most dangerous kind, “contagion” 
of the most abominable kind. Millions of filthy 
deeds, acts of violence and physical contagions are 
far less dangerous than the subtle, spiritual idea of a 
God decked out in the smartest “ideological” 
costumes.^ 



During the 1930s most priests were condemned to a gulag 
from which few returned. Most churches, with their 
religious symbols removed or defaced but their onion 
domes usually left more or less intact, were turned into 
bams, cinemas and garages, or given over to other secular 
purposes. After two decades of bmtal persecution which 
had left only a few hundred churches open for worship, 
the Russian Orthodox Church was unexpectedly revived 
as a public institution by Stalin’s need for its support 
during the Great Patriotic War. In 1943, after a gap of 
seventeen years, the Moscow Patriarchate, the Church’s 
administrative center, was formally reestablished. ^ 
During the remainder of the decade. Orthodox Christians 
reclaimed and lovingly restored several thousand of their 
churches.^ 

The Church, however, paid a heavy price for its 
restoration. The Council for the Affairs of the Russian 
Orthodox Church (later the Council for Religious Affairs) 
worked in close cooperation with the NKVD and its 
successors to ensure the subservience of Church to State.^ 
Both Patriarch Aleksi I and Metropolitan Nikolai of 
Krutitsky and Kolomna, second in the Orthodox 
hierarchy, joined the World Peace Council, the Soviet 
front organization founded in 1949, and were highly 
valued by the KGB as agents of influence.^ Aleksi 
declared in 1955: 



The Russian Orthodox Church supports the totally 
peaceful foreign policy of our government, not 
because the Church allegedly lacks freedom, but 
because Soviet policy is just and corresponds to the 
Christian ideals which the Church preaches.^ 

The Orthodox Church also took a prominent part in the 
founding of another front organization, the Christian 
Peace Conference (CPC), established in 1958 with its 
headquarters in Prague, in a further attempt to mobilize 
worldwide Christian support for the “peace policies” of 
the Soviet Union. At the second conference of the CPC in 
1960 delegates from the rest of the world, mostly innocent 
of its orchestration by Moscow, outnumbered those from 
the Soviet Bloc.^ 

In 1961, with the KGB’s blessing, the Orthodox 
Church joined the World Council of Churches (WCC). At 
that very moment Khrushchev was in the midst of a 
ferocious anti-religious campaign which closed down 
many of the reopened churches, monasteries and 
seminaries and disbanded half the Orthodox parishes. The 
KGB was simultaneously seeking to strengthen its grip on 
the churches which remained. According to a secret KGB 
directive of 1961: 

Up to 600 individuals are studying in the two 
ecclesiastical academies of the Moscow Patriarchate 
and the five ecclesiastical seminaries. These must be 



exploited in the interests of the KGB. We must 
infiltrate our people among the students of these 
ecclesiastical training establishments so that they 
will subsequently influence the state of affairs within 
the Russian Orthodox Church and exert influence on 
the believers.^ 

The head of the Second Chief Directorate, General Oleg 
Mikhailovich Gribanov, reported in 1962 that over the 
previous two years the KGB had infiltrated “reliable 
agents” into the leading positions of the Moscow 
Patriarchate, the Catholic dioceses, the Armenian 
Gregorian Church and other religious groups. These, he 
predicted, would make it possible to remove remaining 
“reactionary Church and sectarian authorities” from their 
posts. ^ 

Since the Russian Orthodox delegates to the WCC were 
carefully selected by the KGB and the Council for 
Religious Affairs, it is scarcely surprising that they denied 
— often indignantly — all reports of the persecution of 
their Church by the Soviet state. According to a KGB 
report of August 1969: 

Agents ALTAR, SVYATOSLAV, ADAMANT, 
MAGISTER, ROSHCHIN and ZEMNOGORSKY 
went to England to take part in the work of the WCC 
central committee. Agents managed to avert hostile 
activities [public criticism of Soviet religious 



persecution] . . 

The most important of the agents at the WCC central 
committee meeting in Canterbury was the leader of the 
Russian Orthodox delegation, Metropolitan Nikodim 
(agent ADAMANT), whose meteoric rise through the 
Church hierarchy was in itself unmistakable evidence of 
KGB approval. In 1960, at the age of only thirty-one, 
Nikodim had become the youngest bishop in 
Christendom. A year later he was put in charge of the 
Moscow Patriarchate’s foreign relations department, and 
in 1964 was appointed Metropolitan of Leningrad. 
Nikodim took the lead in ensuring that there was no 
reference in the WCC central committee’s message to 
member churches either to the invasion of 
Czechoslovakia or to religious persecution in the Soviet 
Bloc. According to a report in the Church Times: 

Agreement on the text of the message was not 
without drama . . . The main critic on the Thursday 
[August 21] when the fifth draft came up for 
discussion was the Metropolitan of Leningrad, 
Archbishop Ni[k]odim. 

. . . The Russian leader then dropped a 
bombshell[:] . . If certain amendments are not 

taken into account which are essential to us, we shall 
have to reject this letter in holy synod and not send it 
to our Churches. I am sorry to speak in such sharp 



terms.” 

. . . On Friday morning [after redrafting] there was 
more sweetness and light, and with the Russian 
leader obviously mollified, the final draft went 
through rapidly. 

The main initiative agreed by the WCC central committee 
was a call to member churches to become “as fully 
engaged as possible in the struggle to eradicate racism in 
whatever form it appears. While welcoming the 
campaign against racism, the Church Times deplored the 
failure of the WCC to address “grave breaches of human 
rights” or to offer help to the oppressed: “Czechoslovakia 
springs to mind as an obvious instance. 

The KGB reported that, at the Canterbury conference, 
its agents had also succeeded “in placing agent 
KUZNETSOV in a high WCC post.” Agent 
KUZNETSOV was Alexei Sergeyevich Buyevsky, lay 
secretary of the Moscow Patriarchate’s foreign relations 
department headed by Nikodim. Since joining the 
department in 1946, Buyevsky had accompanied all the 
major Russian Orthodox delegations abroad and had met 
the most important visitors from foreign churches to 
Moscow. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s he played an 
active role in the work of the WCC central committee, 
helping to draft policy statements on international 
affairs. 

In 1973 the Bishop of Bristol told the Church Times 



that, of the 130 members of the WCC central committee, 
42 percent were Westerners, 28 percent Eastern Orthodox 
(mainly Russian), and 30 percent from the Third World 
(mainly Africa). The Russian Orthodox and Third World 
majority saw Westerners “primarily as the representatives 
of ‘colonialism’ with all the emotional overtones which 
that contains.” KGB agents on the WCC were 
remarkably successful in dissuading it from paying 
serious attention to religious persecution in the Soviet 
Bloc and in persuading it to concentrate instead on the 
sins of the imperialist West. The Reverend Richard 
Holloway of the Scottish Episcopal Church told the 
Nairobi Assembly of the WCC in 1975: 

I have observed there is an unwritten rule operating 
that says that the USSR must never be castigated in 
public. Nevertheless it is well known that the USSR 
is in the forefront of human rights violations. To 
mention this fact appears to be unsporting. I think 
this tradition should end. The USSR should take its 
place in the public confessional along with the rest of 
us from white neo-imperialism.^^ 

As late as 1989, the Centre claimed that, following the 
secret implementation of “a plan approved by the KGB 
leadership,” “the WCC executive and central committee 
adopted public statements (eight) and messages (three) 
which corresponded to the political direction of Socialist 



[Communist] countries.” 

Members of the Orthodox hierarchy sent on missions to 
foreign church leaders, doubtless with KGB approval, 
invariably insisted that believers in the Soviet Union 
enjoyed freedom of religion. In January 1975 
Metropolitan Yuvenali of Krutitsky and Kolomna, who 
had succeeded his cousin Metropolitan Nikodim as the 
globetrotting chairman of the Patriarchate’s foreign 
relations department, traveled to Britain for the 
enthronement of the new Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr. 
Donald Coggan. In an interview on the BBC World 
Service, Yuvenali condemned the tendency of “certain 
circles” in Britain, including some in the Church of 
England, to give a biased and one-sided view of the 
Orthodox Church in Russia. In a private meeting with Dr. 
Coggan, he attacked the Church Times for its “offensive” 
stories on religious persecution in Russia and denounced 
Keston College, the world’s leading research center on 
religion in Communist countries, directed by the Anglican 
priest Michael Bourdeaux, as “anti-Soviet.” Though 
courteous. Dr. Coggan was more robust than most of the 
Western council members of the WCC. Yuvenali 
appeared incredulous as the Archbishop patiently 
defended the independence of the Church Times and the 
fairmindedness of Keston College. During a visit to the 
Soviet Union two years later Dr. Coggan annoyed his 
hosts by departing from the prepared itinerary to visit 
Moscow synagogues and the congregation of the 



imprisoned Baptist minister, Georgi Vins, in Kiev, where 
he led the singing of the hymn “He Who Would Valiant 

Among KGB agents in the Patriarchate’s foreign 
relations department who were regularly used as agents of 
influence in meetings with Western churches was the 
monk Iosif Pustoutov, who was recruited in 1970, aged 
twenty-six, with the codename YESAULENKO. Over the 
next few years YESAULENKO was sent on missions to 
the Netherlands, West Germany, Italy and France. In 
1976 he was appointed representative of the Moscow 
Patriarchate of the Russian Orthodox Church at the 
Prague headquarters of the Christian Peace Conference. In 
order to raise his standing in the religious community, his 
case officer at the Prague residency, Yevgeni Vasilyevich 
Medvedev, arranged for him to be regularly invited to 
embassy receptions given by the Soviet ambassador.^^ 

It would be both simplistic and unjust to see all the 
KGB’s agents and co-optees in the Orthodox Church and 
the WCC simply as cynical careerists with no real 
religious faith — though that may have been true of a 
minority. Most Russian Orthodox priests probably 
believed they had no option but to accept some of the 
demands of state security. One of the best-known 
dissident priests of the 1970s, Father Dmitri Dudko, later 
declared: 


One hundred percent of the clergy were forced to 



cooperate to some extent with the KGB and pass on 
some sort of information — otherwise they would 
have been deprived of the possibility to work in a 
parish. 

A minority, however, did successfully resist all the 
pressure placed on them by the KGB. In December 1991, 
shortly before the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the last 
deputy chairman of the KGB, Anatoli Oleinikov, told an 
interviewer that, of the Russian Orthodox priests 
approached by the KGB, 15 to 20 percent had refused to 
work for it.^^ The courageous minority who resisted all 
KGB pressure were inevitably denied advancement. The 
section of the Orthodox Church most compromised by its 
association with the KGB was its hierarchy. 

It would be wrong, however, to interpret the deference 
shown by the hierarchy to the KGB simply in terms of the 
moral inadequacy of individual bishops. The Church was 
strongly influenced by a centuries-old tradition of 
Orthodox spirituality which emphasized submission to 
both God and Caesar. Before the Revolution, obedience to 
the Tsar had been regarded almost as a religious 
obligation. The Orthodox Church had traditionally 
functioned as a department of state as well as a guide to 
salvation. Metropolitan Nikodim of Leningrad, who 
headed the Russian Orthodox delegation to the WCC until 
his sudden death during a visit to the Vatican in 1978, 
impressed many Western Christians by his deep devotion 



to the Orthodox liturgy and the apparent intensity of his 
prayer during church services. Nikodim’s admirers 
included Pope John Paul I, who was with him when 
Nikodim died of a heart attack and said afterwards that he 
had pronounced during their meeting “the most beautiful 
words about the Church that I ever heard.”^^ Yet Nikodim 
was not merely supine in his submission to the Soviet 
powers-that-be but also a KGB agent.^^ So was his 
private secretary and confidant, Nikolai Lvovich 
Tserpitsky, who was recruited in 1971 with the codename 
VLADIMIR.2^ 

A report by the Council for Religious Affairs in 1974 
distinguished three categories of Orthodox bishop. The 
first category 

affirm both in words and deed not only loyalty but 
also patriotism towards the socialist society; strictly 
observe the laws on cults, and educate the parish 
clergy and believers in the same spirit; realistically 
understand that our state is not interested in 
proclaiming the role of religion and the church in 
society; and, realizing this, do not display any 
particular activeness in extending the influence of 
Orthodoxy among the population. 

Among the bishops in this category were Patriarch Pimen, 
who had succeeded Aleksi I in 1971, and Metropolitan 
Aleksi of Tallinn and Estonia, who in 1990 was to 



succeed Pimen as Patriarch Aleksi 11.^^ Both were 
fulsome in their public praise of Soviet leaders. Pimen 
even claimed to detect “lofty spiritual qualities” in 
Andropov, the chief persecutor of religious dissent during 
his patriarchate. On Andropov’s death Pimen declared 
that he would always “remember with heartfelt gratitude” 
his “benevolent understanding of the needs of our 
Church. 

Like Patriarch Aleksi I, Pimen was used by the KGB to 
front Soviet “peace” propaganda, paying gushing and 
sycophantic tribute to Brezhnev’s “titanic work in the 
cause of international peace. In February 1976 he. 
Metropolitan Aleksi and the other metropolitans on the 
Holy Synod received special awards from the Soviet 
Peace Fund “for manifold and fruitful activities of the 
Russian Orthodox Church in the struggle for peace, 
security and friendship. A month later the Patriarch 
was given a similar award by the World Peace Council to 
mark its twenty-fifth anniversary. In June 1977, Pimen 
hosted a conference at Zagorsk, organized behind the 
scenes by the KGB, entitled “Religious Workers for 
Lasting Peace, Disarmament and Just Relations among 
Nations,” which attracted 663 delegates from 107 
countries, representing all the major world religions.^ ^ 
The conference approved a call by Pimen to declare the 
years up to 2,000 “a period of struggle for peace” — thus, 
in the KGB’s view, preempting the danger that the 



Vatican might take the lead in a similar appeal. A month 
later Pimen was awarded the Order of the Red Banner 
“for his great patriotic activities in defense of peace. 

The second category of bishops identified by the 
Council of Religious Affairs in 1974 consisted of those 
who, though loyal to the state and “correct” in their 
observance of the laws on religious observance, wished to 
“heighten the role of the Church in personal, family and 
public life . . . and select for priestly office young people 
who are zealous adherents of Orthodox piety.” Despite his 
use as an agent of influence in the World Council of 
Churches and elsewhere. Metropolitan Nikodim was 
included in this second category rather than the first — 
probably because of what was considered his excessive 
zeal in encouraging religious devotion. The third category 
of bishops (just under a third of the total) consisted of 
those “who at different times have made attempts to evade 
the laws on cults,” though without the conspicuous 
defiance which would have required their removal from 
office. 

The first sign of dissidence within the Orthodox Church 
to gain worldwide publicity during the Brezhnev era was 
an appeal to the Fifth Assembly of the World Council of 
Churches at Nairobi in November 1975 by the banned 
priest Father Gleb Yakunin and the layman Lev Regelson, 
who appealed for support for the victims of religious 
persecution in the Soviet Union — a hitherto taboo subject 



at WCC meetings. A Swiss delegate was applauded 
when he proposed that a resolution on “Disarmament, the 
Helsinki Agreement and Religious Liberty” include the 
statement: 

The WCC is concerned about restrictions to religious 
liberty, particularly in the USSR. The Assembly 
respectfully requests the government of the USSR to 
implement effectively principle no. 7 [religious and 
other freedoms] of the Helsinki Agreement. 

Metropolitan Yuvenali complained that this proposal 
offended Christian charity. A KGB agent on the drafting 
committee, Alexei Buyevsky (KUZNETSOV), working 
“in the spirit of brotherly love, mutual understanding and 
the spirit of fellowship,” helped produce a formula which 
avoided any specific reference to the Soviet Union but 
“recognize [d] that churches in different parts of Europe 
are living and working under very different conditions 
and traditions.” The WCC’s general secretary, the West 
Indian Methodist Dr. Philip Potter, was asked to prepare a 
report on religious liberty in all countries which had 
signed the Helsinki Accords. The Times interpreted the 
WCC resolution as “a sidestep by churches on Soviet 
curbs. 

There were no such prevarications in the denunciation 
of Western racism and imperialism. One of the keynote 
speakers at the assembly. Dr. Robert McAffie Brown of 



the Union Theological Seminary, New York, confessed 
that, as a white, male middle-class American, he 
embodied the sins of “racism, sexism, classism and 
imperialism.” In an attempt to avoid “linguistic 
imperialism,” he then began speaking in Spanish, thus 
forcing most of his audience to reach for their headsets so 
that they could hear his address translated back into 
imperialist English. The WCC’s refusal to consider non- 
white racism, such as the expulsion of Ugandan Asians in 
1972, led to protests and a walk-out by some British 
delegates — prompting the comment by Dr. Potter that, 
“Wherever the British have gone in the world they have 
established a racist system.”^^ At the end of the 
conference, lobbying by the Sovietfront Christian Peace 
Conference helped to ensure the election of Metropolitan 
Nikodim (agent ADAMANT) as one of the WCC’s six 
presidents. 

Had Andropov and the KGB leadership kept any sense 
of proportion about the threat of “ideological subversion” 
posed by the few brave dissidents within a generally 
subservient Orthodox Church, they would have been quite 
satisfied by the outcome of the Nairobi Assembly. In fact, 
mild though the WCC response to the appeal from 
Yakunin and Regelson was, it caused outrage at the 
Centre. Despite complaints by Dr. Potter’s critics in the 
West that he was “openly anti-Western and anti- 
capitalist,”^^ the KGB claimed that, in reality, he had 



“anti-Soviet leanings” and was “known for his 
provocative statements about the absence of freedom of 
conscience in the USSR.”^^ Though he had been given a 
carefully staged-managed tour of Soviet religious 
institutions two months before the Nairobi Assembly, 
Potter had failed to defend them against Yakunin’s and 
Regelson’s outrageously accurate criticisms. Metropolitan 
Filaret of Kiev and Gallich told a Novosti correspondent 
after the assembly: 

We deplore the prejudiced conviction held by the 
WCC leadership about our state and the Russian 
Orthodox Church. WCC general secretary Mr. 

Potter, by the way, was my guest last September and 
saw for himself that churches and monasteries were 
open. While here he attended divine services and 
said that he was always filled with joy when visiting 
this peace-loving country, in the midst of such 
prayerful and happy surroundings. It seemed strange 
and surprising to us that at the assembly he said 
nothing about his visit to the Soviet Union, including 
the Ukraine. 

The Centre organized a flood of letters to the ungrateful 
Dr. Potter from Russian Orthodox clergy. Baptists and 
other Soviet Christians, protesting at his alleged hostility 
towards them. It also sought to orchestrate public 
criticism of Potter by “prominent religious figures” in 



Britain, Syria and Lebanon, as well as in the Soviet 
Union. Further KGB active measures included the 
publication in Moscow of an English-language book. 
Religion Under Socialism, and the production of a TV 
documentary. Freedom of Religion in the USSR, both 
involving a probably English-speaking agent codenamed 
“K” (not identified in Mitrokhin’s notes). Attempts were 
also made to “compromise” Potter personally in various 
ways and — ^probably through KGB agents in the WCC — 
to suggest his replacement as general secretary. 
Archbishop Kiprian (agent SIMONOV) from the Moscow 
Church of the Consolation of All Who Sorrow, gave an 
interview denouncing “fabrications concerning the so- 
called persecution of believers in the USSR.”^^ 

The absurdity of the KGB’s overreaction to the 
temporary embarrassment of the Nairobi Assembly and 
Dr. Potter’s handling of it was well illustrated by his 
report to the WCC central committee in August 1976 on 
progress to religious liberty in those countries which had 
signed the Helsinki Accords. His lengthy address said 
nothing about religious persecution in the Soviet Bloc, 
despite extensive, well-documented evidence of it 
submitted by Keston College and others. Dr. Potter did, 
however, insist that “it is essential for churches in Europe 
and north America to be aware of the problems created 
and maintained by European and American domination of 
other regions of the world. 

The most serious act of public defiance within the 



Orthodox Church during the Brezhnev era was, in the 
Centre’s view, the foundation in December 1976 of the 
Christian Committee for the Defence of Believers’ Rights 
in the USSR by Father Gleb Yakunin, Hierodeacon 
Varsonofy (Khaibulin) and a layman, Viktor 
Kapitanchuk. The declared aim of the committee, which 
worked in consultation with the Helsinki Monitoring 
Group, was to help believers of all denominations 
“exercise their rights in accordance with their 
convictions.”^^ “Yakunin and his associates,” reported the 
Centre, “are in practice engaging in a struggle with the 
existing order in the USSR . . . proclaiming a national 
religious revival in Russia as an alternative to Marxist- 
Leninist ideology”: 

The committee has an extensive network of 
correspondents among religious fanatics; they are the 
main suppliers of information about the situation of 
believers in the USSR to places abroad. 

In order to cause a schism in the Russian 
Orthodox Church and to set up a new Church 
organization taking up anti-Soviet positions, the 
Christian Committee has launched a campaign to 
compromise clergy loyal to the Soviet state as unfit 
to defend the interests of the believers. 

By 1980 — to the consternation of the KGB — eleven 
volumes of documents totaling 1,189 pages of Russian 



text, obtained by the Christian Committee, had been 
published in the West.^^ 

The KGB eventually demolished the Christian 
Committee by its traditional techniques of destabilization, 
agent penetration and persecution. The Fifth Directorate 
concluded that the most vulnerable of the committee’s 
founders was Hierodeacon Varsanofy. With the assistance 
of GALKIN (an unidentified agent in the Orthodox 
Church), Varsanofy was assigned early in 1978 to a 
church in Vladimir region whose incumbent, 
VOLZHSKY, was a long-standing KGB agent. Finding it 
difficult to stay in touch with Yakunin and Kapitanchuk, 
Varsanofy resigned from the Christian Committee. 
According to Varsanofy ’s file, VOLZHSKY introduced 
him to a sympathetic psychiatrist (also a KGB agent, 
codenamed BULKIN), who persuaded him that he was 
suffering from a nervous illness and should give up 
membership of the Christian Committee in order to 
reduce the stress he was under and prevent his illness 
from getting worse. The KGB claimed the credit for 
inducing Varsonofy “to abandon political activity and 
concentrate on research work in the field of theology, 
using materials from the Oblast archives.” While he was 
working in the archives, another KGB agent, codenamed 
SPIRANSKY, succeeded in winning his confidence and 
allegedly “deflected Varsanofy from his obsession of 
becoming the spokesman of believers in the Soviet 
Union”: 



Finally he was persuaded to send a letter to Patriarch 
Pimen of All Russia and to senior personalities in the 
Russian Orthodox Church apologizing for the hurt 
that he had caused.^^ 

On September 28, 1978 the Centre secretly 

promulgated KGB order no. 00122 on “Measures to 
Strengthen Agent Operational Work in the Struggle with 
the Subversive Activity of Foreign Clerical Centres and 
Hostile Elements among Church People and Sectarians”: 
a lengthy document which reflected both the KGB’s 
addiction to conspiracy theory and its obsession with 
“ideological subversion” of all kinds. It also paid 
unwitting, if irritated, tribute to the courage of the 
persecuted believers and the vitality of their faith. 
Mitrokhin’s notes on order no. 00122 include the 
following: 

Under the pretense of concern for the freedom of 
belief and the rights of believers in the USSR, 
imperialist intelligence services and foreign anti- 
Soviet centers were organizing ideological sabotage, 
aimed at undermining the moral and political unity 
of Soviet society and undermining the basis of the 
Socialist system; they sought to discredit the Soviet 
state and social order, incite religious organizations 
towards confrontations with the state and stimulate 
the emergence of an anti-Soviet underground among 



sectarians. With encouragement from abroad, hostile 
elements had launched active organizational and 
provocational activity aimed at forming illegal 
groups and organizations within the sectarian milieu, 
setting up printing presses and establishing contacts 
with foreign clerical centers. 

Following the directives of the May 1975 conference of 
leading officials of KGB agencies [dealing with religious 
affairs], it had been possible to carry out measures to 
strengthen operational positions in international religious 
organizations, to expose and compromise their leaders, 
officials and emissaries of clerical centers. Experienced 
and reliable agents had been infiltrated into the leading 
circles of some sectarian formations and measures to 
identify, prevent and terminate the subversive activity of 
hostile elements among the clerical anti-Soviet 
underground had become more effective, the further 
strengthening of the positions of progressive religious 
figures had been ensured, as well as their active 
participation in the struggle for peace and other political 
measures. 

Operational work, however, still did not meet present 
requirements of the present time. The operational 
situation in a number of sectors of KGB agency work 
remained tense. The work of disrupting and detaching 
believers, especially among young people, from the 
influence of hostile elements was being carried out feebly. 



Agent positions in the leading ranks of the dissident 
Baptists, the Catholic and Uniate priesthood, the 
Pentecostalists, the Adventists and the Jehovah’s 
Witnesses, and among the irregular Moslem clerics, were 
weak. 

The USSR KGB Collegium decided as follows: 

1. To raise the level of agent operational work 
designed to struggle against the subversive activity 
conducted under the cover of religion by imperialist 
intelligence services, clerical centers abroad and 
hostile elements within the country. The basic task 
was to identify in good time, prevent and put an end 
to the subversive designs of the adversary to 
stimulate anti-Soviet activity in the sectarian 
environment, creating religious formations hostile to 
the Socialist system and drawing believers into their 
sphere of influence. 

2. The FCD, the SCD and the Fifth Directorate 
of the KGB were to identify the foreign anti-Soviet 
clerical organizations which, evidence showed, were 
being used by the adversary’s special services and 
were to submit proposals for identifying and cutting 
off subversive channels, identifying and intercepting 
communication channels with hostile elements in the 
sectarian milieu . . . 

3. The Fifth Directorate and the local KGB 
agencies were to take steps to put an end to hostile 
activity designed to undermine loyalty to the Soviet 



state and the social order by the largest religious 
organization in the USSR, namely the Orthodox 
Church; they were to prevent the penetration of 
individuals with hostile attitudes in the leading ranks 
of the Church; in 1978-80, they were to take steps to 
strengthen the operational positions [i.e. the number 
and quality of agents] within the structure of the 
Orthodox Church (in Metropolitan provinces. 
Eparchies, parishes, monasteries and educational 
establishments), and to compromise and remove 
reactionary and anti-Soviet elements . . 

The Christian Committee for the Defence of Believers’ 
Rights sought to protect itself against KGB penetration in 
part by remaining small, never having more than four 
members at any one time.^^ In May 1979, however, it was 
joined by Father Vasili Fonchenkov, unaware that nine 
years earlier he had been recruited by the Fifth Directorate 
as agent DRUG (“Friend”). According to his file, “He 
was involved in the cultivation of specific individuals [in 
the Orthodox Church], carried out his assignments 
conscientiously and showed initiative.” Since 1972 
Fonchenkov had been a lecturer at the Zagorsk 
theological academy as well as holding a position in the 
foreign relations department of the Moscow Patriarchate. 
In 1976-7 he had been the incumbent of the church of St. 
Sergi in East Berlin and editor of Stimme der Orthodoxie 
{Voice of Orthodoxy), the journal of the Patriarchate’s 



central European exarchate.^ ^ His contacts with foreign 
churches may well have helped to recommend agent 
DRUG to his unwitting colleagues on the Christian 
Committee. 

The KGB campaign against public dissent in the 
Orthodox Church reached its peak in 1979-80, with a 
wave of arrests of leading dissidents — chief among them 
Father Gleb Yakunin — who were later imprisoned or 
persuaded to recant. Probably to protect his cover, 
Fonchenkov was summoned for interrogation by the KGB 
and issued a statement saying that he was threatened with 
arrest, but was never charged. During a visit to West 
Germany in March 1980 Archbishop Pitirim of 
Volokolamsk (agent ABBAT)^^ bizarrely declared that 
there had been “no wave of arrests. The first major 
success of the KGB campaign was to persuade the 
charismatic Moscow priest Father Dmitri Dudko, whose 
offenses included calling for the canonization of 
Orthodox martyrs of the Soviet era, to make a public 
recantation on Soviet television in June 1980. Dudko ’s 
resistance had been broken by a particularly skillful KGB 
interrogator, Vladimir Sergeyevich Sorokin, whom he had 
come to regard as “my own brother.” He said later that he 
had hoped that parts of his confession, such as his 
condemnation of “the sabre-rattling of the Carter 
administration,” would be recognized as words placed in 
his mouth by the KGB. His reputation, however, never 



fully recovered. 

There was no prospect of a recantation by Yakunin. 
Only his wife was allowed to attend his trial. The rest of 
his family and friends, along with the Western press, were 
refused admittance, while what one correspondent 
described as “burly young men in ill-fitting suits,” 
selected by the KGB, filed into the courtroom. Probably 
to protect his cover, Fonchenkov was among those who 
were turned away.^^ Those called to give evidence against 
Yakunin included several KGB agents inside the 
Orthodox Church, among them Iosif Pustoutov 
(YESAULENKO), former representative of the Moscow 
Patriarchate at the Prague headquarters of the Christian 
Peace Conference, who testified to the harmful 
international consequences of the Christian Committee’s 
work. Yakunin accepted his sentence of five years’ 
imprisonment, followed by five years’ internal exile, with 
the words, “I thank God for this test He has sent me. I 
consider it a great honor, and, as a Christian, accept it 
gladly.” The British Council of Churches sent an appeal 
to Brezhnev, urging the court to reconsider its opinion. 
Attempts to gain the support of the World Council of 
Churches for a similar appeal met with no response. 

A change in WCC rules before its Vancouver 
Assembly in 1983 ensured that the KGB suffered no 
repetition of the embarrassment caused by the discussion 
of the Yakunin and Regelson letter at the previous 



assembly seven and a half years earlier. Under the new 
regulations, probably prompted by the KGB agents on the 
WCC council: 


Appeals from groups or individuals for World 
Council of Churches intervention cannot be acted on 
by the assembly without the support of delegates or 
member churches, but will be followed up by the 
WCC general secretary. 

An open letter from Vladimir Rusak, a Russian Orthodox 
deacon who had been dismissed for writing an 
unauthorized history of the Church after the October 
Revolution, appealed to delegates at Vancouver to “stop 
treating the propagandistic claims of Soviet delegates as 
the only source of information” on religion in the Soviet 
Union. He also urged the assembly to hold a frank debate 
on religious freedom. The mere discussion of the 
Yakunin-Regelson letter at Nairobi had “yielded some 
definite results” by embarrassing the authorities into the 
“hurried publication” of some copies of the Bible. The 
assembly also received another letter on behalf of thirty- 
five imprisoned Soviet Christians and 20,000 persecuted 
Pentecostalists who wished to emigrate to the West. 
Unsurprisingly, neither letter received support from 
Soviet delegates and neither was discussed at the 
assembly. 

The embarrassment of the Afghan War was also 



successfully contained. Despite the desire of a minority of 
delegates for “a condemnation of Soviet aggression and 
the unconditional withdrawal of Soviet troops,” the final 
compromise resolution called for a Soviet withdrawal 
only “in the context of an overall political settlement 
between Afghanistan and the USSR” (conveniently 
ignoring the fact that the Kabul regime had been installed 
by the Soviet invaders) and “an end to the supply of arms 
to the opposition groups from outside” (in other words, 
the denial of arms to those resisting the Soviet invasion). 
These were precisely the conditions which the Soviet 
Union itself laid down for the withdrawal of its troops. 
Unsurprisingly, the Russian Orthodox delegation praised 
the final resolution as “balanced and realistic.” The 
Vancouver Assembly had no such inhibitions in 
condemning the West. Western capitalism was duly 
denounced as the main source of injustice in the world, 
responsible for the evils of sexism, racism, “cultural 
captivity, colonialism, and neo-colonialism.”^^ 

The success, in Moscow’s view, of the Vancouver 
Assembly, probably helps to explain why the Centre 
established as one of the priorities for KGB active 
measures for 1984: 

Exerting influence in our favor on the activity of . . . 

clerical organizations on the questions of war and 

peace, and other key contemporary problems. 



Looking back on his career in the KGB, Oleg Kalugin 
concludes that, like “the stranglehold over the Church 
inside the Soviet Union,” the penetration and exploitation 
of the Russian Orthodox Church abroad was “one of the 
most sordid and little known chapters in the history of our 
organization.”^^ Mitrokhin came to the same conclusion, 
commenting at one point in his notes that the files 
contained “a whirlpool of filth. The KGB used its 
agents among Russian Orthodox clergy in the West not 
merely to spy on emigre communities but also to identify 
possible agent recruits. Though the Russian Orthodox 
Church in north America was split, the faction which 
remained loyal to the Moscow Patriarchate was, 
according to Kalugin, “riddled with KGB agents. 
Among the agents identified in the files noted by 
Mitrokhin was a cleric codenamed PETROV, who was 
sent to north America in the 1970s. His case officers in 
north America contacted him by using the passwords 
“Pyotr Mikhailovich,” the first name and patronymic of 
his Fifth Directorate controller in Moscow. 

The file on Arkadi Rodyonovich Tyshchuk 
(VORONOV), a priest who was posted to the Nikolsky 
Russian Orthodox cathedral in New York from 1977 to 
1982, contains evidence of a hostility to the United States 
which may also have helped to motivate other Orthodox 
priests in the KGB’s north American network. The United 
States, VORONOV told his KGB case officer, suffered 



from the sin of pride — “and pride comes before a fall:” 


When a country declares itself to be the most 
powerful and the richest, and that its government is 
the smartest and possesses the best weapons — that is 
not maturity, it is bragging, and is the reason for the 
downfall of all the powerful nations of the past. 

VORONOV usually met his controller from the New 
York residency either at the Soviet mission to the United 
Nations, where he went to collect his correspondence 
from Russia, or on board the ship Mikhail Lermontov, 
which regularly came into port at New York. More 
difficult to explain than his hostility to the United States 
was his apparent admiration for the KGB which, 
according to his file, he bizarrely described as a “good 
shepherd” and a “true Russian spiritual guardian and 
shepherd. 

Russian Orthodox priests in the West were also used by 
FCD Directorate S to collect material for use in devising 
the well-documented legends of KGB illegals. In the early 
1970s, for example, two KGB agents in the Moscow 
Patriarchate were sent to carry out detailed research on 
parish registers in Canada. Ivan Grigoryevich Borcha 
(codenamed FYODOR), who worked as a priest in prairie 
parishes of Ukrainian and Romanian communities, 
studied registers in Alberta and Saskatchewan. Viktor 
Sergeyevich Petlyuchenko (PATRIOT), who was 



assigned to Orthodox parishes in Edmonton, carried out 
further research in Alberta. 

The Russian Orthodox Church, both at home and 
abroad, took a prominent part in the Rodina 
(“Motherland”) Society founded as a front organization 
by the KGB in December 1975 to promote “cultural 
relations with compatriots abroad,” and thus provide new 
opportunities for agent recruitment among emigre 
communities. Its vice-president, P. I. Vasilyev, was a 
senior member of the FCD’s Nineteenth (Soviet emigre) 
Department and headed a secret Rodina intelligence 
section. Metropolitan Aleksi of Tallinn and Estonia 
(agent DROZDOV),^^ the future Patriarch Aleksi II, who 
was made a Rodina council member, told its opening 
conference, “We are all united by our love for our 
Socialist motherland.” Through its exarchates, dioceses 
and parishes in Europe, America, Asia and Africa, the 
Orthodox Church “continued to maintain spiritual ties 
with our compatriots” and was “doing its best to keep 
these contacts alive and active. Metropolitan Aleksi is 
unlikely to have been unaware that these contacts were 
exploited by the KGB. According to a KGB document of 
1988, “An order was drafted by the USSR KGB chairman 
to award an honorary citation to agent DROZDOV” for 
unspecified services to state security. 


THOUGH NEVER FULLY satisfied by the extent of its 



stranglehold over the Orthodox Church, the KGB was far 
more concerned by the “subversive” activities of those 
Christians over whom it had no direct control. The largest 
of the underground churches was the Greek Catholic (or 
Uniate) Church of Ukraine (nowadays the Ukrainian 
Catholic Church), whose liturgy and structure followed 
the “Eastern Rite” but which accepted the authority of 
Rome. Fearful at the end of the Second World War that 
the Uniate Church would provide a focus for Ukrainian 
nationalism, Stalin set out to terrorize it into submission 
to Moscow. In 1946 a mock synod in Lviv cathedral, 
staged by the MGB with the assistance of a small number 
of Uniate stooges and the blessing of the Orthodox 
hierarchy, announced the “reunion” of the Greek 
Catholics with the Russian Orthodox Church. Greek 
Catholic Archbishop (later Cardinal) Josyf Slipyj wrote 
later: 


Our priests were given the choice of either joining 
the “church of the Regime” and thereby renouncing 
Catholic unity, or enduring for at least ten years the 
harsh fate of deportation and all the penalties 
associated with it. The overwhelming majority of 
priests chose the way of the Soviet Union’s prisons 
and concentration camps. 


Almost overnight, the four million Uniate Christians 
became the world’s largest illegal church. All but two of 



its ten bishops, along with many thousands of priests and 
believers, died for their faith in the Siberian gulagJ^ 

In 1963 Slipyj was expelled to Rome, leaving Bishop 
(later Archbishop) Vasyl Velychkovsky as effective 
leader of the underground church. The KGB immediately 
deployed five agents^TIKHOV, SIDORENKO, 
ROMANENKO, SOVA and PODOLENIN (none 
identified in Mitrokhin’s notes) — in a series of attempts to 
discredit Velychkovsky among the persecuted Uniate 
faithful. TIKHOV, evidently a member of the 
underground church, periodically sent to Slipyj in the 
Vatican letters containing disinformation about 
Velychkovsky fabricated by the Centre. According to 
KGB files, Slipyj sent his own emissaries to the Ukraine 
to check the truth of the allegations against his successor, 
but agents who were planted on them confirmed 
TIKHOV’ s fabrications.^^ KGB reports, however, 
probably overstated the success of their active measures. 
There is no convincing evidence of a breach between 
Slipyj and Velychkovsky. 

In July 1967 a conference of senior officials of Soviet 
Bloc intelligence agencies met in Budapest to discuss 
“work against the Vatican; measures to discredit the 
Vatican and its backers; and measures to exacerbate 
differences within the Vatican and between the Vatican 
and capitalist countries. Two senior KGB officers, 
Agayants and Khamazyuk, addressed the conference on 



“The Hostile Activity of the Vatican and of the Catholic 
and Uniate Clergy on the Territory of the USSR and the 
Experience of the [KGB] Agencies in Countering this 
Activity.” A third, Kulikov, spoke on “Some aspects of 
agent operational work against Vatican institutions.” On 
the proposal of the KGB delegation, all but the Romanian 
representatives agreed on the need to intensify “work 
against the Vatican in close relation with the work against 
the Main Adversary.” Andropov, who regarded the 
Uniates as the spearhead of the Vatican’s ideological 
sabotage offensive in the Soviet Union, wrote to the 
Central Committee, emphasizing the importance of the 
conference’s conclusions.^^ 

Andropov’s obsession with ideological subversion by 
the Holy See was doubtless reinforced by the claim in a 
1968 intelligence report that the Vatican’s Secretariat of 
State had devised a masterplan to shatter the unity of the 
Soviet Union and had given the Deputy Secretary of 
State, Cardinal Giovanni Benelli, the task of 
implementing it.^^ A Centre assessment of 1969 repeated 
the claim that the Vatican was out “to shatter the Soviet 
Union from within with the help of ideological sabotage”: 

Church people were disseminating Church 
propaganda literature, praising the Western way of 
life, whipping up nationalist feelings among the 
population of Soviet Republics and sowing distrust 
among Soviet people towards Soviet and Party

A professional antireligioznik from the Ukraine, speaking 
at an official conference in 1969, paid unwitting tribute to 
the continued vitality of the persecuted Uniates: 

Nurturing hopes for the restoration of the Uniate 
Church, its apologists are working on the clergy who 
reunited with Orthodoxy, trying to persuade them to 
repudiate the “Muscovites” and to adopt openly or 
secretly a Uniate, pro- Vatican line. In some regions 
of the Ukraine, illegal schools were organized to 
train new Uniate priests. In a series of localities, the 
Uniates have willfully opened previously closed 
churches and have been conducting [unauthorized] 
religious services . . 

On April 4, 1969 Andropov approved further 

“measures to intensify the struggle against subversive 
activity by the Vatican and the Uniates on the territory of 
the USSR in 1969-70,” to be implemented jointly by the 
FCD, the Fifth (Dissidents and Ideological Subversion) 
Directorate and local KGBs. The FCD was instructed, 
somewhat ambitiously, to attempt the agent penetration of 
all major sections of the Vatican bureaucracy, the Jesuit 
order, the Russicum and other pontifical colleges training 
priests for Eastern churches, as well as to make 
operational contact with three Roman clerics — 



codenamed APOSTOL, RASS and SLUGA — who had 
been bom in the Soviet Union7^ Among the few 
successes in this ambitious program by the end of 1969 
which Mitrokhin found in Centre files was the penetration 
of pontifical colleges by KGB agents from the legally 
established Catholic Church in the Soviet Union, 
particularly the Baltic republics. PETROV and 
ROGULIN, both agents of the Fifth Directorate, had 
arrived in Rome in January 1968 to begin three years’ 
study at the Russicum; in 1969 they went on an 
intelligence-gathering mission to “Catholic centers” in 
France and Belgium.^^ During 1969, two KGB agents 
from Fithuania, ANT AN AS and VIDMANTAS, were 
studying at the Gregorian University. Two other 
Fithuanian agents, DAKTARAS (a bishop) and 
ZHIBUTE, took part in the working commission for the 
reform of the Canon Faw Codex, held at the Vatican from 
May 21 to June 11, 1969. DAKTARAS told his case 
officer that, at a papal audience on June 7, Paul VI had 
told him, “I remember you in my prayers and hope that 
God will help the clergy and believers [in Fithuania]. 

With the assistance of the Hungarian AVH, the KGB 
also succeeded in cultivating a member of the Vatican’s 
Congregation for the Eastern Church, Uniate Bishop 
Dudas, who was resident in Hungary. A Fifth Directorate 
female agent, POTOCHINA, who had probably infiltrated 
the underground church in Ukraine, traveled regularly to 



Hungary on the pretext of visiting a relative and — 
according to her file — succeeded in winning Dudas’s 
confidence. Dudas doubtless never suspected that she 
was a KGB agent, sent to obtain intelligence on the 
Vatican’s secret contacts with the Ukrainian Uniates. 

The operations against the Vatican approved by 
Andropov in April 1969 also included a series of active 
measures. The KGB was instructed to find ways of 
creating distrust between emigre clerics in Rome and 
Uniates and other Catholics in the Soviet Union. The 
leading KGB agents in the Russian Orthodox Church who 
were in contact with the Vatican — DROZDOV 
(Metropolitan Aleksi), ADAMANT (Metropolitan 
Nikodim), SVYATOSLAV and NESTEROV (both 
unidentified) — ^were instructed “to cause dissension 
between Vatican organizations such as the Congregation 
for the Eastern Church, the Secretariat for Christian Unity 
and the Commission for Justice and Peace.” In order to 
put pressure on the Vatican “to cease its subversive 
activity,” ADAMANT was also instructed to tell his 
contacts in the Roman Curia that the Soviet government 
was contemplating establishing autonomous Catholic 
churches in the Baltic republics and elsewhere in the 
Soviet Union which would be independent of Rome. The 
Lithuanian bishop DAKTARAS passed on the same 
message when he attended a bishop’s conference in Rome 
in October 1969.^^ There is no evidence that any of the 
active measures had a discernible effect on Vatican 



policy. 

As well as giving higher priority to operations against 
the Vatican, Andropov also stepped up the persecution of 
the Ukrainian Uniates. In 1969 the head of the 
underground church, Bishop Velychkovsky, was arrested 
and sentenced to three years’ imprisonment. The KGB 
reported that his arrest “greatly helped to achieve a 
psychological breakthrough in the mind of SERAFIM,” 
another leading figure in the Uniate underground, who 
was recruited as a KGB agent. According to Mitrokhin’s 
notes on his file: 

SERAFIM explained in detail by whom, when and in 
what circumstances he was tasked to direct monks 
illegally; he reported incidents of criminal 
organizational activity by Bishop Velychkovsky and 
his close contacts; he reported on the situation 
among underground orders of monks . . . and he 
drew up a list of Uniate priests operating illegally. 
SERAFIM’S answers were recorded covertly on 
tape. 

Though SERAFIM agreed to “cooperate secretly” with 
the KGB, he refused to sign the written undertaking 
required of most informers. His controller did not insist, 
on the grounds that it would represent too great “a 
psychological trial for a man of religion” and leave him in 
fear of “divine punishment in the next world.” Another 



agent, terrified of “being cast into Hell,” had once begged 
the controller, on bended knee, to return his signed 
undertaking.^^ 

In 1971 the KGB also succeeded in recruiting in Lviv 
one of the leading members of an underground order of 
Uniate monks, codenamed IRENEY, who served as one 
of the main points of contact with the Catholic Church in 
Poland. The Fifth Department regarded IRENEY as a 
tough nut to crack. If confronted directly with his “illegal 
activity,” he would probably be strong enough to 
withstand the usual uncompromising interrogation. If 
given too many details of his activities, he would be able 
to identify members of the underground church who had 
informed on him. The KGB decided to begin by mounting 
a major surveillance operation on IRENEY’ s sister and 
“conspiratorial” collaborator, MARIYA. After 
MARIYA’S sudden death, with IRENEY in deep 
depression, his case officer judged that the time was ripe 
for “a complex recruitment operation.” IRENEY was 
brought in for interrogation and given extensive details of 
his ministry in the underground church, carefully 
designed to give the misleading impression that MARIYA 
had been informing on him for many years. Mitrokhin’s 
notes give the following summary of the interrogator’s 
self-congratulatory report: 

The monk lost the power of speech; he was totally 

stunned by this astonishing thought. His wild eyes. 



trembling hands, and the perspiration which covered 
his face betrayed his strong spiritual turmoil . . . 
Judging that denials were useless, [IRENEY ] 
described the membership of the illegal leadership of 
the monastic order in Ukraine; he named Uniate 
authorities and monks who had come to Lvov [Lviv] 
through the tourist channel; and he spoke of his own 
journey to Poland in 1971 and of the meetings that 
he had held there. A month later, [IRENEY] was 
recruited . . . but refused to give a signed 
undertaking. 

IRENEY remained so convinced that his sister had been a 
KGB agent that, when passing information to his 
controller, he frequently added the comment, “No doubt 
my sister told you this.” According to his KGB file, he 
never ceased to marvel at the way in which sister had 
succeeded in keeping her KGB connection a secret from 
him.^^ 

In 1972, like Slipyj nine years earlier. Bishop 
Velychkovsky was deported to the Vatican. A year later 
the KGB managed to gain access to Slipyj. Cardinal Felici 
invited to the Vatican a leading Uniate cleric from 
Czechoslovakia, unaware that he was a KGB agent 
codenamed PROFESSOR. Originally recruited by the 
Czechoslovak StB, PROFESSOR had been used by the 
KGB in 1971 to go on a supposedly “pastoral” visitation 
of the Redemptorist Order in Ukraine in order to provide 



intelligence on the activities of the underground church 
and its links with Rome. In September 1973 he met Slipyj 
in the Vatican. Plans were made for PROFESSOR to meet 
the Uniate leadership in Lviv, but Mitrokhin’s notes do 
not record whether this meeting went ahead. 

In February 1975 a conference of Soviet Bloc 
intelligence services considered the coordination of 
operations against, and agent penetration in, the 
Vatican. The Polish SB, Czechoslovak StB and 
Hungarian AVH all reported that they had “significant 
agent positions in the Vatican.” Mitrokhin’s notes record 
no such claim by the KGB. As at the similar conference in 
1967, however, a hugely ambitious and unrealistic 
program for agent penetration was drawn up, which 
included plans to cultivate the Uniate leadership and no 
fewer than seven cardinals (Casaroli, Willebrands, Kinig, 
Samora, Benelli, Poggi and Pignedoli), as well as an 
elaborate series of active measures to influence and 
discredit the Catholic Church. 

Among the individual targets for character 
assassination was Velychkovsky’s successor as head of 
the underground Uniate Church, Bishop (later 
Metropolitan Archbishop) Volodymyr Stemyuk. Agent 
NATASHA spread disinformation about Stemyuk’ s 
alleged sexual immorality and the same stories were 
passed by other agents to the Vatican. As a result, 
according to KGB reports, “he lost the support of a 



significant part of the Uniates.”^^ In reality, despite a new 
and vicious round of religious persecution in the early 
1980s, the KGB lost its war against the Uniates. In 1987 
Stemyuk emerged from the underground at the age of 
eighty-one with the status of a national hero, openly 
acknowledged by Rome as head of the Catholic Church in 
Ukraine — to the dismay of both the KGB and most of the 
Orthodox hierarchy. Metropolitan Filaret of Kiev and 
Galich insisted as late as October 1989, “The Uniates will 
never be legalized in our country.” They were legalized 
by the end of the year.^^ 

AFTER THE UNIATES and other Catholics, the KGB 
was most concerned during its war against religious 
“ideological subversion” in the Soviet Union by the 
activities of the unregistered Protestant churches and 
sects, which — like the Uniates — were outside direct state 
control. In the late 1950s the KGB estimated the 
membership of what it termed “illegal sectarian 
formations” — chief among them the Reform Baptists, 
Pentecostalists, Jehovah’s Witnesses and Reformed 
Adventists — at about 100,000.^^ 

The fact that throughout the Brezhnev era the KGB 
continued, on Andropov’s instructions, to spend so much 
time and effort on groups who represented no conceivable 
threat to the Soviet system is further evidence of its 
obsession with even the most harmless forms of dissent. 



Andropov made the keynote of his address to an allunion 
KGB conference in 1975 the claim that anti-Soviet 
elements were conspiring against the state “under cover of 
religion.” The first essential in unmasking and defeating 
the conspiracies was agent penetration: 

This is difficult, since false perceptions of the 
attitude of the state towards religion which still 
prevail in their milieu have left a definite mark on 
the psychology of the believers. Among sectarians 
there is a prejudice that any assistance to the 
authorities, including the KGB, is a great sin — 
treason. There is no trust in the humanism of the 
Cheka. 

Andropov’s complaint that believers failed to trust the 
“humanism” of the KGB provides further evidence of his 
limited sense of the absurd. To illustrate the difficulties of 
agent penetration among the ungrateful sectarians, he 
gave the example of “one candidate for recruitment, who 
had almost freed himself from errors with regard to the 
Cheka, and carried out particular assignments from an 
operational officer:” 

. . . One day, however, he declared that meetings 
with his operational officer were sinful. He explained 
that the Lord God had appeared to him in a dream, 
had handcuffed him and asked: “Whose servant art 



thou?” Greatly shaken by this dream, the potential 
recruit interpreted it as a warning from God and 
stopped meeting the Chekist.^^ 

Mitrokhin cannot have been the only KGB officer who, as 
he listened to such speeches or read articles on operations 
against believers in the classified in-house journal KGB 
Sbornik, secretly admired their courage and their faith. No 
hint of that admiration, however, appeared in KGB 
reports. 

By the 1960s the KGB leadership had reluctantly 
concluded that no amount of persecution would wipe out 
the sectarians altogether. A conference in March 1959 of 
senior KGB officers leading “the struggle against 
Jehovists [Jehovah’s Witnesses]” concluded that the 
correct strategy was “to continue measures of repression 
with measures of disruption.”^^ The KGB set out to 
divide, demoralize and discredit the sectarians, as well as 
to arrest their most influential leaders on trumped-up 
charges. 

In 1966 Pastors Georgi Vins and Gennadi Kryuchkov, 
the leaders of the Reform Baptists, probably the largest 
sectarian group, were jailed for three years. After their 
release, both went underground to continue their ministry. 
In 1974 Vins was caught and rearrested. Despite a major 
international campaign on his behalf, he was sentenced to 
a further ten years’ imprisonment, but was released in a 
“spy exchange” in 1979 and expelled to the United States. 



Pastor Kryuchkov remained at liberty until 1989, when he 
dramatically reappeared in public at an emotional Reform 
Baptist congress. His success in continuing a secret 
ministry for almost twenty years without being caught by 
the KGB remains one of the most astonishing 
achievements in the history of the Soviet religious 
underground.^^ 

Remarkably, however, the KGB was even more 
concerned by Jehovah’s Witnesses, viewed with 
indifference or suspicion by most governments around the 
world, than by the Reform Baptists, whose heroic 
endurance of persecution attracted international 
sympathy. The head of the Second Chief Directorate, 
General Oleg Mikhailovich Gribanov, reported in 1962, 
“The most hostile of the sectarians are the Jehovists.”^^ 
Since their emergence in the United States in the 1870s, 
no other Christian sect has spent so much of its energies 
on prophesying the end of the world. Though many of its 
detailed prophecies have been discredited and the 
Apocalypse has been repeatedly postponed, the basic 
millennarian message of Jehovah’s Witnesses has never 
varied: “The end is near. Christ will reveal himself shortly 
to bring destruction upon the nations and all who oppose 
is messianic kingdom.”^^ 

In the course of the twentieth century Jehovah’s 
Witnesses have been persecuted by many authoritarian 
regimes. Thousands suffered martyrdom in the death 



camps of the Nazi Third Reich. No major intelligence 
agency, however, has been quite as concerned as the KGB 
by the “Jehovist conspiracy.” The Jehovist obsession of 
senior KGB officers was, perhaps, the supreme example 
of their lack of any sense of proportion when dealing with 
even the most insignificant forms of dissent. 

Until the Second World War there had been no 
Jehovah’s Witnesses in the Soviet Union. The 
incorporation of eastern Poland, Lithuania and Moldavia 
in 1939-40, however, turned thousands of Witnesses into 
unwilling Soviet citizens. Many were deported to 
Siberia, accused of being “an American sect.”^^ In 1968 
the KGB put the total number of Jehovah’s Witnesses at 
about 20,000.^^ The fact that the Witnesses had originated 
in the United States and still had their world headquarters 
in Brooklyn was regarded as deeply suspicious by the 
Centre’s many conspiracy theorists. The almost surreal 
outrage of KGB analysts, as they denounced the 
Witnesses for describing the Soviet state (like states in 
general) as the work of the Devil, would not be out of 
place in Bulgakov’s The Master and Margarita: 

The sect of the Jehovah’s Witnesses or Students of 
the Bible is a foreign invention. It is dangerous 
because it is actively engaged in drawing new 
members into the sect . . . The sectarians call 
Communists and the Komsomols “sons of the 



Devil.” 

They demonstrate that the Soviet state is founded 
by Satan. Therefore one must not implement Soviet 
laws, or take part in elections, and they urge people 
to refuse to serve in the Soviet army. Jehovists 
extend assistance of all kind to their co-religionists 
who are in the [labor] camps or in internal exile, 
supplying them with money, food and clothing. 

The Soviet press, meanwhile, accused the Witnesses’ 
Brooklyn headquarters of organizing an aggressive 
crusade against the countries of the Soviet Bloc.^^^ 

The Centre was disturbed by reports that, even in labor 
camps, “the Jehovah leaders and authorities did not reject 
their hostile beliefs and in camp conditions continued to 
carry out their Jehovah work.” A conference of KGB 
officers working on operations against Jehovah’s 
Witnesses met at Kishinev in November 1967 to discuss 
new measures “to prevent the sectarians’ hostile work” 
and “ideological subversion:” 

The agencies were to strengthen in every way their 
agent positions among Jehovah’s Witnesses within 
the country; they were to collect and build up 
information about young members of the sect and 
about the Jehovah authorities for operational 
purposes, recruitment, compromise and for open 
countermeasures . . . The conference recognized that 



it was essential to select and promote to leading 
positions in the sect, with the help of agents, people 
who were barely literate, who lacked initiative and 
were unlikely to stimulate the activity of subordinate 
units. 

The seriousness with which the conference discussed the 
Jehovist menace was, once again, almost surreal. The 
allegedly dangerous conspiracy which the Centre devoted 
so many resources to combating amounted to little more 
than the attempt by small groups to worship together in 
private, mostly in each others’ homes, and their refusal to 
perform military service. Yet the conspiracy was judged 
so dangerous that the conference agreed on the need for 
agent penetration of the Brooklyn headquarters and its 
west European branches. It was also feared that 
Brooklyn might correctly identify some Jehovah’s 
Witnesses who had gone long periods without arrest as 
KGB agents. The conference therefore agreed on the need 
to “create a reliable reserved of understudy agents” for 
use if the existing agents were unmasked. 

As well as grossly exaggerating the menace of the 
Jehovah’s Witnesses and other sectarians, the KGB 
Sbornik also contained self-congratulatory accounts of the 
active measures used to destabilize them. One such case 
study in the mid-1970s concerned the leader of the 
Jehovah’s Witnesses in Khmelnitskaya Oblast, 
codenamed PAVEL, whose “criminal activities consisted 



of drawing new members into the sect, conducting illegal 
gatherings, inducing young believers to refuse to serve in 
the army, holding and disseminating religious literature.” 
The KGB concocted “well-documented defamatory 
materials” which were used in a press campaign against 
him. Even PAVEL ’s children from his first marriage were 
persuaded to sign a newspaper article about him. Finally 
an evening meeting was arranged by the KGB in 
Shepetovka, attended by local Jehovah’s Witnesses, as 
well as representatives of the Party, provincial 
administration, collective farms and newspapers, at which 
PAVEL was subjected to a series of doubtless well- 
rehearsed denunciations of his alleged indolence, cruelty, 
egoism and dissolute behavior. The KGB report on the 
meeting noted with satisfaction that the evening ended in 
PAVEL ’s utter humiliation and the “unrestrained 
sobbing” of his second wife.^^^ 

Like the other sectarians, Jehovah’s Witnesses showed 
an astonishing capacity to survive persecution. During the 
Gorbachev era, the KGB’s campaign against them 
gradually disintegrated. In October 1989, doubtless to the 
outrage of many KGB officers, the head of the European 
department of the Brooklyn Centre, Willi Pohl, arrived in 
Moscow as the guest of the Council of Religious Affairs 
to visit Soviet Witness communities and discuss their 
future. 


DURING THE LATER 1980s the Moscow Patriarchate 



seemed to be trying neither to fall behind nor to overtake 
the speed at which the official programs of glasnost and 
perestroika were developing. In 1991, a year after 
succeeding Pimen as Patriarch, Aleksi II, finally 
dissociated himself and the Russian Orthodox Church 
from the “declaration of loyalty” to the Soviet system 
issued by Metropolitan Sergi in 1927. When an 
interviewer reminded him that, a quarter of a century 
earlier, the Council for Religious Affairs had classed him 
as one of those bishops most loyal to the state, the 
Patriarch asked for forgiveness and understanding of his 
attitude at the time. As the Soviet Union began to 
disintegrate in the final months of 1991, Aleksi II 
declared that “Russia has suffered a severe illness in the 
form of Communism. 

The Russian Orthodox Church, however, continued to 
be haunted by its past history of KGB penetration. After 
the failure of the August coup in 1991, the Russian 
government’s Committee on Freedom of Conscience, 
which included Father Gleb Yakunin, was given access to 
a section of the KGB archives which showed that some 
members of the Orthodox hierarchy had been KGB 
agents. After Yakunin published a selection of the 
documents, the archives were closed once more; he was 
accused of having betrayed state secrets to the United 
States and threatened with a private prosecution. 
Father Gleb remained defiant. He wrote to the Patriarch in 
January 1994: 



If the Church is not cleansed of the taint of the spy 
and informer, it cannot be reborn. Unfortunately, 
only one archbishop — Archbishop Khrizostom of 
Lithuania — has had the courage publicly to 
acknowledge that in the past he worked as an agent, 
and has revealed his codename: RESTAVRATOR. 
No other Church hierarch has followed his example, 
however. 

The most prominent agents of the past include 
DROZDOV — the only one of the churchmen to be 
officially honored with an award by the KGB of the 
USSR, in 1988, for oustanding intelligence services 
^ADAMANT, OSTROVSKY, MIKHAILOV, 
TOPAZ and ABB AT. It is obvious that none of these 
or the less exalted agents are preparing to repent. On 
the contrary, they deliver themselves of pastoral 
maxims on the allegedly neutral character of 
informing on the Church, and articles have appeared 
in the Church press justifying the role of the 
informer as essential for the survival of the Church 
in an anti-religious state. 

The codenames I discovered in the archives of the 
KGB belong to the top hierarchs of the Moscow 
Patriarchate. 

The letter to Aleksi II was unprecedented in the history of 

the Russian Orthodox Church — for, as the Patriarch must 



surely have been aware, DROZDOV, the most important 
of the KGB agents discovered by Father Gleb in the KGB 
archives, was in fact himself. 



TWENTY - NINE 


THE POLISH POPE AND THE RISE 

OF SOLIDARITY 


For forty years all challenges to the Communist one-party 
states established in eastern Europe in the wake of the 
Second World War were successfully contained. 
Opponents of the regimes usually felt too powerless to 
organize any visible opposition to them. On the rare 
occasions when the survival of the one-party state seemed 
in question — in Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 
1968 — it was swiftly and brutally shored up with an 
overwhelming show of force. The Polish challenge to the 
Soviet system, however, eventually succeeded where the 
Hungarian Uprising and the Prague Spring failed. Though 
contained for a decade, it was never mastered and 
eventually began the disintegration of the Soviet Bloc. 

The Polish crisis began in a wholly novel and 
unforeseen way — not, as in Hungary and Czechoslovakia, 
with the emergence of revisionist governments, but with 
the election of October 16, 1978 of Cardinal Karol 
Wojtyla, Archbishop of Krakdw, as Pope John Paul II. No 



Soviet leader was tempted any longer to repeat Stalin’s 
scornful question at the end of the Second World War, 
“How many divisions has the Pope?” The undermining of 
the empire built by Stalin after Yalta was begun not by 
the military might of the West but by the moral authority 
of the first Polish Pope, which rapidly eclipsed that of the 
PUWP (the Polish Communist Party). 

Boris Aristov, the Soviet ambassador in Warsaw, 
reported to the Politburo that the Polish authorities 
regarded the new Pope as “a virulent anti-Communist.”^ 
The Centre agreed. Since 1971 Wojty la had been the 
target of PROGRESS operations designed to monitor his 
allegedly subversive role in undermining the authority of 
the Polish one-party state.^ The day after Wojtyla’s 
election, the head of the KGB mission in Warsaw, Vadim 
Pavlov, sent Moscow an assessment of him by the SB, the 
KGB’s Polish equivalent: 

Wojtyla holds extreme anti-Communist views. 
Without openly opposing the Socialist system, he has 
criticized the way in which the state agencies of the 
Polish People’s Republic have functioned, making 
the following accusations: 

• that the basic human rights of Polish 
citizens are restricted; 

• that there is unacceptable exploitation of 
the workers, whom “the Catholic Church must 
protect against the workers’ government”; 



• that the activities of the Catholic Church 
are restricted and Catholics treated as second- 
class citizens; 

• that an extensive campaign is being 
conducted to convert society to atheism and 
impose an alien ideology on the people; 

• that the Catholic Church is denied its 
proper cultural role, thereby depriving Polish 
culture of its national treasures. 

In Wojtyla’s view, the concept of the one-party state 
“meant depriving the people of its sovereignty.” 
“Collectivization,” he believed, “led to the destruction of 
the individual and of his personality.” The fact that he 
dared to say what most Polish Catholics thought seemed 
to both the KGB and the SB evidence of his commitment 
to ideological subversion. 

The SB report forwarded to the Centre reveals that as 
early as 1973-4 the Polish Procurator-general had 
considered prosecuting Wojtyla for his sermons. Three of 
his homilies — in Warsaw on May 5, 1973, in the Krakow 
steelmaking suburb of Nowa Huta on May 12, 1973 and 
in Krakow on November 24, 1974 — were judged in 
breach of article 194 of the Criminal Code, which 
provided for terms of imprisonment of from one to ten 
years for seditious statements during religious services. 
According to an SB informant, Wojtyla had declared 
during one of his sermons, “The Church has the right to 



criticize all manifestations and aspects of the activity of 
the authorities if they are unacceptable to the people.”^ 
Wojtyla, however, was protected by his eminence. 
Though the UB (predecessor of the SB) had interned the 
Polish primate, Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski, for three 
years in the 1950s, by the 1970s the Gierek regime no 
longer dared to arrest a cardinal. The SB thus lapsed into a 
tone of largely impotent outrage as it denounced 
Wojtyla’ s “moral support to the initiatives of anti-socialist 
elements.” 

In June 1976 Gierek repeated the mistake which had 
led to Gomulka’s downfall six years earlier and ordered a 
sudden increase in food prices. After a wave of protest 
strikes and riots, the price rises were withdrawn. On 
September 30 Wojtyla set up a fund to assist the families 
of those in the Krakdw archdiocese who had been 
imprisoned for taking part in the protests or injured in 
clashes with the riot police.^ He also took an active 
interest in the formation after the strike wave of KOR, the 
Workers Defence Committee, which sought to create an 
alliance of workers and dissident intellectuals. According 
to SB surveillance reports, during the autumn of 1976 
Wojtyla had a series of meetings with KOR’s founders in 
the apartment of the writer Bohdan Cywihski, later a 
prominent Solidarity activist.^ The SB also reported that 
he met individually KOR militants from a great variety of 
backgrounds: among them the dissident Communist Jacek 



Kuron, the wartime resistance fighter Jan Jozef Lipski, the 
ex-Maoist Antoni Macierewicz and the writer Jerzy 
Andrzej ewski.^ 

Wojtyla rarely read newspapers, listened to the news on 
the radio or watched it on television. Every fortnight, 
however. Father Andrzej Bardecki, the Church’s liaison 
officer with the Catholic weekly Tygodnik Powszechny (to 
which Wojtyla was a regular contributor), came to his 
study in the archbishop’s palace at Krakow and gave him 
a news briefing.^ Bardecki had been a target of 
PROGRESS operations by KGB illegals ever since 
BOGUN, posing as a West German press photographer, 
had first made contact with him in 1971.^ In 1977 another 
illegal, Ivan Ivanovich Bunyk, codenamed FIFO SO V 
(“Philosopher”), who had been instructed by the Centre to 
develop sources inside the Polish Church, had a series of 
meetings with Bardecki. Bunyk had been bom in France 
but had emigrated as a teenager with his Ukrainian family 
to the Soviet Union in 1947. In 1970 he had returned to 
France as a KGB illegal, trained as a journalist and set 
himself up as a freelance writer and poet. On his first 
meeting with Bardecki in 1977, FIFOSOV probably 
presented him with one or more of the books he had 
published in France with the aid of KGB subsidies. 
Though the files noted by Mitrokhin do not include 
FIFOSOV ’s reports from Poland, there is little doubt that 
his main priority in cultivating Bardecki was to seek out 



information on Wojtyla.^ 

SB surveillance reports during 1977 showed Wojtyla 
aligning himself with a variety of protest movements. On 
March 23 he received the student organizers of a petition 
of protest to the authorities and gave them his support. 
Increasingly he invoked the example of St. Stanislaw, the 
martyred bishop of ancient Krakow whose silver 
sarcophagus formed part of the high altar in the cathedral, 
as a symbol of resistance to an unjust state: 

St. Stanislaw has become the patron saint of moral 
and social order in the country ... He dared to tell 
the King himself that he was bound to respect the 
law of God ... He was also the defender of the 
freedom that is the inalienable right of every man, so 
that the violation of that freedom by the state is at the 
same time a violation of the moral and social order. ^ ^ 

It is easy to imagine the rage in the Centre as Wojtyla 
continued with impunity to defend the rights of the 
individual against violation by the Polish state. 

Among the greatest triumphs of Wojtyla’ s years at 
Krakow was the consecration on May 15, 1977 of the 
great new church at Nowa Huta, constructed after many 
years of opposition from a regime which had sought to 
exclude a visible Catholic presence from what it intended 
as a model “Socialist city.”^^ In his sermon to a 
congregation of over 20,000, Wojtyla gave his blessing to 



those protesting against the death of a KOR activist, 
Stanislaw Pyjas, who was widely believed — despite 
official denials — to have been murdered by the SB.^^ That 
evening a long procession of mourners wound its way 
through the streets of Krakow to Wawel Castle, where a 
Committee of Student Solidarity was formed. Similar 
committees followed in other cities, all independent of the 
officially sponsored Socialist Union of Polish Students. 

As church bells rang out across Poland on October 16, 
1978 and the streets filled with excited crowds to 
celebrate Wojtyla’s election as pope, the PUWP Politburo 
reacted with private shock and alarm. Publicly, the 
Politburo reluctantly felt compelled to associate itself with 
the mood of popular rejoicing and sent a lengthy telegram 
of congratulations to the Vatican, expressing hypocritical 
joy that for the first time “a son of the Polish nation . . . 
sits on the papal throne.” What particularly disturbed the 
KGB, however, was the evidence that among many 
PUWP members, even some senior officials, the joy was 
genuine. As well as sending official reports on Polish 
popular rejoicing, KGB officers in Warsaw also 
unofficially relayed to their colleagues at the Centre some 
of the political jokes circulating immediately after John 
Paul IPs election. The white smoke from the Vatican 
chimney, traditionally used to signal the election of a 
pope, was said to have been followed on this occasion by 
red smoke; Wojtyla had burned his Party card. According 



to another satirical account, the new pope had secretly 
visited the Polish interior minister, who was responsible 
for the SB, and announced after the election, “Comrade 
minister! Your important instructions have been carried 
out!”i6 

Two days after the election, Aristov, the Soviet 
ambassador, reported to Moscow in more serious vein: 

The leadership of the Polish People’s Republic 
considers that the danger of Wojtyla’s move to the 
Vatican is that it will now clearly be more difficult to 
use the Vatican as a moderating influence on the 
Polish episcopate in its relations with the state. The 
Catholic Church will now make even greater efforts 
to consolidate its position and increase its role in the 
social and political life of the country. 

At the same time, our friends consider that 
Wojtyla’s departure from the country also has its 
positive side, since the reactionary part of the 
episcopate has been deprived of its leader — one who 
had an excellent chance of becoming Primate of the 
Polish Catholic Church. 

Aristov criticized the Polish Politburo for compromising 
its ability to resist the Church’s future demands by its past 
weakness in permitting the construction of new churches, 
the ordination of more priests and larger print-runs for 
Catholic publications.^^ 



At the time of Wojtyla’s election, Poland was probably 
the world’s most Catholic country. The KGB estimated 
that 90 percent of the population were Catholic. With 
569 ordinations in 1978, Poland had the highest ratio of 
priestly vocations to population anywhere on earth. In 
total, there were 19,193 Polish priests and 5,325 students 
in seminaries. Somewhat alarmist KGB assessments put 
the figures higher still.^^ A steady rise in religious 
practice continued over the next few years. According to a 
secret study circulated to the PUWP central committee, 
“This phenomenon emerged particularly acutely among 
the intelligentsia, especially among persons with higher 
education.” In 1978 25 percent of those with higher 
education were reported to engage in private prayer at 
home; by 1983 the figure had risen to over 50 percent. 
The central committee study plausibly attributed the 
increase to the “social-political crisis” and the influence 
of the Polish Pope.^^ Even many Polish Party officials felt 
in awe of Wojtyla’s intense, mystical spirituality. They 
reported to Moscow that he often spent six to eight hours 
a day in prayer. On entering his private chapel, aides 
would sometimes find him lying motionless on the marble 
floor, his arms outstretched in the shape of a cross. 

The KGB privately denounced some of John Paul IPs 
first acts in the Vatican as “anti-Soviet gestures.” Among 
them was his order on the day after his election that the 
red zuchetto — cardinal’s skullcap — which he had worn at 



the papal conclave should be taken to Lithuania by two 
priests from the Krakow archdiocese and placed on the 
altar of the church of the Virgin of Mercy in Vilnius. 
What most concerned the Centre during the early weeks 
of the new pontificate, however, was the Pope’s evident 
determination to give the Vatican a major voice in world 
affairs. Though John Paul IPs concerns ranged widely 
over the problems of peacekeeping and human rights 
around the globe, his first priority was the situation in 
Poland and eastern Europe.^^ The Centre was particularly 
suspicious of the Pope’s appointment of the 
Lithuanianbom Andris Backis as one of his chief advisers 
on the Vatican’s relations with the Soviet Bloc. Backis’s 
father had served as pre-war ambassador of independent 
Lithuania in Paris, and Backis himself was believed to 
follow in the same “bourgeois” tradition. His appointment 
was, in the Centre’s view, another “anti-Soviet gesture. 

On November 5 the Pope made his first official visit 
outside the Vatican to Assisi, the city of St. Francis, 
patron saint of Italy. A voice from the crowd urged him to 
remember eastern Europe: “Don’t forget the Church of 
Silence!” “It’s not a Church of Silence any more,” replied 
John Paul II, “because it speaks with my voice. 

Among the illegals sent on PROGRESS operations to 
Poland after Wojtyla’s election was Oleg Petrovich 
Buryen (codenamed DEREVLYOV), who posed as the 
representative of a firm of Canadian publishers. 



DEREVLYOV claimed to be collecting material about 
Polish missionaries in the Far East and used this as a 
pretext for contacting a number of prominent Church 
figures, most of whom recommended him to others. If 
arrested by the police or SB, he was told to stick firmly to 
his cover story and insist that he was a Canadian citizen. 
In case of real emergency, however, he was instructed to 
ask to see Colonel Jan Slovikowski of the SB, who 
appears to have acted as a point of contact for KGB 
agents who found themselves in difficulty with the Polish 
authorities. Among DEREVLYOV’ s most prized contacts 
was one of the Pope’s closest friends. Father Jozef 
Tischner, a fellow philosopher who had helped him found 
the Papal Theological Academy in Krakow.^^ Tischner 
was a frequent visitor to Rome and one of those chosen 
by John Paul II to revive his spirits when he felt trapped 
in the Vatican.^^ 

One of John Paul IPs chief ambitions during the first 
year of his pontificate was to return to Poland. Early in 
1979, horrified that the PUWP Politburo was prepared to 
contemplate a papal visit, Brezhnev rang Gierek to try to 
dissuade him. “How could I not receive a Polish pope,” 
Gierek replied, “when the majority of my countrymen are 
Catholics?” Absurdly, Brezhnev urged him to persuade 
the Pope to have a diplomatic illness: “Tell the Pope — he 
is a wise man — that he could announce publicly that he 
cannot come because he has been taken ill.” When Gierek 
failed to see the merit of this odd suggestion, Brezhnev 



told him angrily, “Gomulka was a better Communist [than 
you] because he wouldn’t receive [Pope] Paul VI in 
Poland, and nothing awful happened!” The conversation 
ended with Brezhnev saying, “Well, do what you want, so 
long as you and your Party don’t regret it later” — at which 
point Brezhnev put the phone down.^^ 

On June 2, 1979 more than a million Poles converged 
on the airport road, on Warsaw’s Victory Square and in 
the Old City, rebuilt from the rubble after the Second 
World War, to welcome John Paul II on his emotional 
return to his homeland. Over the next nine days at least 
ten million people came to see and hear him; most of the 
remaining twenty-five million witnessed his triumphal 
progress through Poland on television. At the end of his 
visit, as the Pope bade farewell to his home city of 
Krakow, where, he said, “every stone and brick is dear to 
me,” men and women wept uncontrollably in the streets. 
The contrast between the political bankruptcy of the 
Communist regime and the moral authority of the 
Catholic Church was plain for all to see. 

The papal visit, the Centre reported to the Politburo, 
had lived up to its worst expectations.^^ Many Polish 
Party members, faced with the Pope’s “ideological 
subversion” of the Communist regime, felt that the 
ideological battle had been lost. During the visit the KGB 
mission in Warsaw had even thought it possible that KOR 
militants and anti-Communist workers in Krakow might 
try to seize power from the Party. Emergency preparations 



were also made to evacuate the Soviet trade mission in 
Katowice, which was headed by a KGB officer, to 
Czechoslovakia.^^ The Centre believed that John Paul II 
had set out to challenge the foundations of the whole 
Soviet Bloc. One KGB report emphasized that he had 
repeatedly called himself not just the “Polish Pope” but, 
even more frequently, the “Slav Pope.”^^ In his homilies 
he had recalled one by one the baptism of the peoples of 
eastern Europe: Poles, Croats, Slovenes, Bulgarians, 
Moravians, Slovaks, Czechs, Serbs, Russians and 
Lithuanians: 

Pope John Paul II, a Slav, a son of the Polish nation, 
feels how deeply rooted he is in the soil of history . . 

. He comes here to speak before the whole Church, 
before Europe and the world, about those oft- 
forgotten nations and peoples. 

A Politburo document concluded that the Vatican had 
embarked on an “ideological struggle against Socialist 
countries.” Since the election of John Paul II, papal policy 
towards Catholic regions of the Soviet Union — especially 
in Ukraine, Lithuania, Latvia and Byelorussia — had 
become “more aggressive,” aiding and abetting “disloyal 
priests.” On November 13 the Central Committee 
secretariat approved a six-point “Decision to Work 
Against the Policies of the Vatican in Relation with 
Socialist States,” prepared by a subcommittee which 



included Andropov and the deputy chairman of the KGB, 
Viktor Chebrikov. The KGB was instructed to organize 
propaganda campaigns in the Soviet Bloc “to show that 
Vatican policies go against the life of the Catholic 
Church” and to embark on active measures in the West 
“to demonstrate that the leadership of the new Pope, John 
Paul II, is dangerous to the Catholic Church.”^^ 

One of the chief priorities of SB foreign operations was 
to build up an agent network among the Poles in Rome 
and the Vatican. On June 16, 1980 the KGB mission in 
Warsaw reported to the Centre: 

Our friends [the SB] have serious operational 
positions [i.e. agents] at their disposal in the Vatican, 
and these enable them to have direct access to the 
Pope and to the Roman congregation. Apart from 
experienced agents, towards whom John Paul II is 
personally well disposed and who can obtain an 
audience with him at any time, our friends have 
agent assets among the leaders of Catholic students 
who are in constant contact with Vatican circles and 
have possibilities in Radio Vatican and the Pope’s 
secretariat. 

The Centre responded by proposing a series of KGB/SB 
“joint long-term operations” with the following aims: 

• To influence the Pope towards active support 
for the idea of international detente [as defined by 



Moscow], peaceful co-existence and cooperation 
between states, and to exert a favorable influence on 
Vatican policy on particular international problems; 

• To intensify disagreements between the 
Vatican and the USA, Israel and other countries; 

• To intensify internal disagreements within the 
Vatican; 

• To study, devise and carry out operations to 
disrupt the Vatican’s plans to strengthen the 
Churches and religious teaching in Socialist 
countries; 

• To exploit KGB assets in the Russian 
Orthodox Church, the Georgian and the Armenian- 
Gregorian Churches; to devise and carry out active 
measures to counteract the expansion of contacts 
between these Churches and the Vatican; 

• To identify the channels through which the 
Polish Church increases its influence and invigorates 
the work of the Church in the Soviet Union. 

Because of the Polish Politburo’s anxiety to avoid 
confrontation with the Catholic Church, however, the 
Centre had low expectations of what joint KGB/SB 
operations were likely to achieve: 

In our view, so long as our friends [the SB] remain 
fearful of damaging the development of relations 
between the Polish People’s Republic and the 
Vatican and between state and Church, they will not 



display great initiative in implementing the measures 
which we propose. Officers in our Centre and in the 
[Warsaw KGB] mission will need to display some 
tact and flexibility in order to find ways of solving 
the task before them.^^ 

Moscow’s fears that the Polish Politburo lacked the 
nerve to confront the challenge to its authority were 
heightened by its apparent capitulation to working-class 
discontent. Sudden rises in food prices in the summer of 
1980 sparked off a strike wave which gave birth to the 
Solidarity trade union movement under the charismatic 
leadership of a hitherto unknown 37-year-old electrician 
from Gdansk, Lech Walesa. The interior ministry 
informed the KGB mission in Warsaw that it had 
established an operations center, headed by Stachura, the 
deputy minister, to direct police and SB operations 
against the strikers, monitor the situation and produce 
daily reports. To judge from a report forwarded to 
Moscow, the Center was remarkably pleased with its own 
performance: “The operational staff displayed a high 
degree of conscientiousness and discipline, and an 
understanding of their duties; combat-readiness was 
introduced; leave was canceled; and round-the-clock work 
was introduced.” While not claiming “complete success,” 
the operations center claimed to have limited the scale of 
the strike movement by “eliminating” their printing 
presses and breaking links between protesters in different 



parts of the country. In addition, “Attempts by anti- 
Socialist forces to establish contacts with the artistic, 
scientific and cultural intelligentsia, in order to enlist their 
support for the demands of the strikers, were cut short.”^^ 
The reality, however, was somewhat different. The 
strikers succeeded in creating inter-factory strike 
committees to coordinate the protest and dissident 
intellectuals played an important part in advising them. 
The final judgment of the KGB mission in Warsaw was in 
stark contrast to the efforts by the Interior Ministry to 
defend its performance. The SB, it reported, “did not 
recognize the extent of the danger in time or the hidden 
discontent of the working class.” And when the strike 
movement began, both the SB and the police were unable 
to control it: 

The blame lay chiefly with the leadership of the 
Interior Ministry, and in particular with Minister 
Kowalczyk and his deputy Stachura . . . When the 
strikes intensified in the coastal region, Kowalczyk 
simply lost his head ... In the opinion of the KGB 
mission, it is time to replace Kowalczyk and 
Stachura with other officers.^^ 

On August 24 Aristov sent Moscow the alarming news 
that the deputy prime minister, Mieczyslaw Jagielski, was 
negotiating with Walesa and the strike leaders. Next 
day, the Soviet Politburo set up a commission headed by 



Suslov, its chief ideologist, to monitor the Polish crisis 
and propose remedies. On August 27, at the Pope’s 
instigation, the Polish bishops approved a document that 
explicitly claimed “the right to independence both of 
organizations representing the workers and of 
organizations of self-government.” Confident of the 
Pope’s backing, Walesa was now convinced that the 
government had little choice but to give in.^^ 

The Polish government privately agreed. On August 27 
the leading members of the Polish Politburo met Aristov 
to try to persuade him that the partial disintegration of the 
PUWP and the hostility to it of much of the Polish people 
had created “a new situation:” 

We must take a step back in order not to fall into the 
abyss, and agree on the creation of self-governing 
trade unions. We have no other political means of 
normalizing the situation, and it is impossible to use 
force. By staging a [tactical] retreat, we can regroup 
Party forces and prepare for offensive action. 

The Poles went through the motions of seeking “the 
opinion of Comrade Brezhnev,” recognizing that trade 
unions free from Party control were “not simply a Polish 
issue but an issue which affects the interests of the entire 
Socialist community. In reality, however, all 
alternatives to the legalization of Solidarity had already 
been ruled out. The Gdansk Agreement of August 31, 



which accepted “the formation of free trade unions as a 
genuine representation of the working class,” made a 
series of unprecedented political concessions, ranging 
from the right to strike to an agreement to broadcast Mass 
every Sunday over the state radio. Walesa signed the 
agreement in front of the television cameras with an 
outsize, garishly colored pen, which he drew with a 
flourish from his top pocket. Produced as a souvenir of 
the papal visit, it had on it a portrait of John Paul 



THIRTY 


THE POLISH CRISIS AND THE 
CRUMBLING OF THE SOVIET BLOC 

In the view of both the KGB and the Soviet Politburo, the 
Gdansk Agreement represented the greatest potential 
threat to the “Socialist Commonwealth” (the official 
designation of the Soviet Bloc) since the Prague Spring of 
1968. On September 3, 1980 the Politburo agreed a series 
of “theses for discussion with representatives of the Polish 
leadership” — a euphemism for demands that the Poles 
recover the ground lost to Solidarity: 

The [Gdansk ] agreement, in essence, signifies the 
legalization of the anti- Socialist opposition . . . The 
problem now is how to prepare a counter-attack and 
reclaim the positions that have been lost among the 
working class and the people ... It is necessary to 
give overriding significance to the consolidation of 
the leading role of the Party in society. ^ 

The principal scapegoat for the success of Solidarity was 
Edward Gierek, the Polish first secretary, bitterly 



criticized by the Soviet ambassador, Aristov, among 
others, for the loss of Party control.^ The strikers at the 
Lenin shipyard had greeted Gierek’s television 
appearances with derisive catcalls. Ordinary Poles 
summed up their feelings in one of the political jokes with 
which they privately mocked their Communist leaders: 

QUESTION: What is the difference between Gierek 
and Gomulka [who had been forced to resign as first 
secretary in 1970]? ANSWER: None, only Gierek 
doesn’t realize it yet!^ 

On September 5 Gierek was succeeded by Stanislaw 
Kania, the tough, heavily built and heavy-drinking Party 
secretary responsible for national security. The KGB in 
Warsaw reported a satirical comment on the changeover 
doing the rounds in Poland — “Better Kania than Vanya!” 
(better, in other words, to put up with an unpopular Polish 
Communist than have to face a Soviet invasion).^ It also 
reported that on September 6 Admiral L. Janczyszyn, the 
commander-in-chief of the Polish navy, had warned two 
Soviet admirals that military intervention would end not 
in “normalization,” as in Prague in 1968, but in 
catastrophe. “If outside troops are brought into Poland,” 
he told them, “there would be a river of blood. You must 
understand that you’re dealing with Poles — not Czechs!”^ 
On September 18 Pavlov, the head of the KGB mission 
in Warsaw, complained to the Centre that the Kania 



regime was already repeating the mistakes of its 
predecessors — looking for compromise with the 
opposition rather than taking a firm stand against them. 
The Party rank and file remained demoralized.^ “The 
counter-revolution in Poland is in full flood!” Brezhnev 
dramatically announced to the Politburo on October 29: 

Walesa is traveling from one end of the country to 
another, to town after town, and they honor him with 
tributes everywhere. Polish leaders keep their 
mouths shut and so does the press. Not even 
television is standing up to these anti- Socialist 
elements . . . Perhaps it really is necessary to 
introduce martial law. 

Brezhnev’s assessment was, predictably, strongly 
supported by Andropov. It was also backed by Mikhail 
Gorbachev, who had joined the Politburo in the previous 
year. “We should speak openly and firmly with our Polish 
friends,” he declared. “Up to now they haven’t taken the 
necessary steps. They’re in a sort of defensive position, 
and they can’t hold it for long — they might end up being 
overthrown themselves.”^ 

The Politburo was concerned not merely by the 
situation in Poland itself but also by the contagious effect 
of Solidarity’s success in some parts of the Soviet Union. 
The PROGRESS operation reports submitted to 
Andropov in October included one from the illegal 



SOBOLEV, who has been sent on a mission to Rubtsovsk 
in the Altay Kray region of Russia, far from the Polish 
border. His report made depressing reading: 

The situation in the town of Rubtsovsk is unstable. 
The population has many grounds to be dissatisfied 
with the situation in the town, antisocial elements are 
visibly engaged in provocative action, and there 
could be uncontrolled disorders . . . Believers 
[practicing Christians] are also ready to speak up, 
and the population approves the strikes in Poland. 

. . . The basic cause of dissatisfaction is food 
supplies, especially the lack of meat in the shops, 
poor living conditions and disgraceful public 
services. The top people are supplied through special 
channels, and for this there are special stores of 
foodstuffs and consumer goods. Theft is rampant, 
and the biggest thieves are officials of the Party city 
committee and the Soviet executive committee. 

There is drunkenness everywhere, and many people 
suffer from alcoholism. 

The Polish events have a negative influence and 
effect on the local population, suggesting that it is 
possible to improve living and economic conditions 
on the Polish model. ^ 

Among the most successful illegals selected for 
PROGRESS operations in Poland itself was FILOSOV, 



still posing as a French writer and poet. According to his 
KGB file, he made “numerous contacts within 
Solidarity.” Perhaps his most important contact was 
Tadeusz Mazowiecki, editor-in-chief of the Solidarity 
weekly, Tygodnik Solidarndsc, to whom he was 
introduced in November by Father Andrzej Bardecki.^ 
Nine years later Mazowiecki was to become prime 
minister of the first Solidarity-led government. 

Early in November, Andropov summoned the new, 
hardline Polish interior minister. General Miroslaw 
Milewski, for talks in Moscow. Milewski reported that 
lists had been prepared of more than 1,200 of the “most 
counter-revolutionary individuals,” who would be 
arrested immediately if martial law were declared. 
Andropov then launched into an alarmist monologue 
designed to persuade Milewski that martial law could not 
be avoided: 

Even if you left Wyszynski [the Polish primate] and 
Walesa in peace, Wyszynski and Walesa would not 
leave you in peace until either they had achieved 
their aim, or they had been actively crushed by the 
Party and the responsible part of the workers. If you 
wait passively . . . the situation slips out of your 
control. I saw how this happened in Hungary [in 
1956]. There, the old leadership waited for 
everything to normalize itself, and when, at last, it 
was decided to act, it turned out that no one could be 



relied upon. There is every reason to fear that the 
same may happen in Poland also, if the most active 
and decisive measures are not now taken. 

This is a struggle for power. If Walesa and his 
fascist confederates came to power, they would start 
to put Communists in prison, to shoot them and 
subject them to every kind of persecution. In such an 
event. Party activists, Chekists [the SB] and military 
leaders would be most under threat. 

You say that some of your comrades cannot take 
on the responsibility of taking any aggressive 
measures against the counter-revolutionaries. But 
why are they not afraid of doing nothing, since this 
could lead to the victory of reaction? One must show 
the Communists, and in the first place the Party 
activists, the Chekists [the SB] and the military 
comrades that it is not just a question of defending 
socialist achievements in Poland, but a question of 
protecting their own lives, that of their families, who 
would be subjected to terror by the reaction, if, God 
forbid, this came to pass. 

Sometimes our Polish comrade say that they 
cannot rely on the Party. I cannot believe this. Out of 
three million Party members, one can find 100,000 
who would be ready to sacrifice themselves. 
Wyszynski and Walesa have roped in the free trade 
unions and are securing more and more new 
positions in various spheres in Poland. There are 



already the first signs that the counter-revolutionary 
infection is affecting the army. 

Comrade Brezhnev says that we must be ready for 
struggle both by peaceful means and by non-peacefiil 
means. 

When Andropov had finished his tirade, Milewski asked 
him, “You have convinced me, but how am I to convince 
our comrades back in Warsaw?” Andropov’s reply is not 
recorded. 

On December 5 an extraordinary meeting of Warsaw 
Pact leaders assembled in Moscow to discuss the Polish 
crisis. Kania heard one speaker after another castigate the 
weakness of his policies and demand an immediate 
crackdown on Solidarity and the Church. Otherwise, he 
was told, Warsaw Pact forces would intervene. Eighteen 
divisions were already on the Polish borders and Kania 
was shown plans for the occupation of Polish cities and 
towns. The meeting was followed by a private discussion 
between Kania and Brezhnev. Military intervention, 
Kania insisted, would be a disaster for the Soviet Union 
as well as for Poland. “OK, we don’t march into Poland 
now,” Brezhnev replied, “but if the situation gets any 
worse we will come.”^^ 

Brezhnev’s threat was probably a bluff. With Soviet 
forces already at war in Afghanistan and the probability 
that military intervention in Poland would result in a 
bloodbath. Western economic sanctions and a global 



public relations disaster, the Kremlin’s strategy was to 
pressure the Poles into using martial law to end 
Solidarity’s challenge to the Communist one-party state. 
Ultimately the most effective way of exercising pressure 
was to threaten invasion by the Red Army. Memories of 
Hungary in 1956, Czechoslovakia in 1968 and 
Afghanistan in 1979 meant that very few in either Poland 
or the West failed to take the threat seriously in 1980. 

It took over a year of almost continuous pressure, 
however, before the Polish Politburo, after a series of 
personnel changes, finally agreed to declare martial law. 
The KGB mission in Warsaw reported in December 1980 
that, although Milewski was ready to go ahead with the 
“repression of hostile people,” most of the Politburo was 
not: 


Our friends consider Kania an honest Communist 
loyal to the Soviet Union and CPSU, but none the 
less one cannot exclude the possibility of a 
substantial difference between his point of view and 
ours, especially on the question of taking decisive 
measures . . . Lately Comrade Kania has tended not 
to adopt immediately recommendations by Soviet 
representatives, displaying doubts and not sharing all 
of our assessments of the situation in the People’s 
Republic of Poland. 


The KGB was also deeply concerned at what it believed 



was the growing Western intelligence presence in Poland. 
According to data supplied by the SB, of the 1,300 
foreign journalists in Poland at the beginning of 1981 
about 150 were members or agents of intelligence 
agencies. NATO intelligence agencies, it was claimed, 
“were acquiring firm agent positions within Solidarity.”^^ 
For much of 1981 the PUWP continued to lose ground 
to Solidarity. On January 15 Walesa was received by John 
Paul II in the Vatican. “The son,” he announced 
reverently to the world’s television cameras, “has come to 
see the father.” Increasingly, the Pope and Walesa now 
appeared as the real leaders of the Polish nation. In his 
conversations with the KGB, Milewski seemed to despair 
of defeating the challenge from Solidarity without Soviet 
military intervention. As the news came in of Walesa’s 
meeting with the Pope, Milewski told Aristov, “I am 
beginning to think that order will come only when Poland 
has a reliable security guarantee in the form of allied 
troops . . Kania admitted to the Soviet ambassador 
that the PUWP had lost touch with the Polish people: 
“This is not a Solidarity slogan but a statement of fact, of 
the bitter truth.” The only forces on which he could rely 
were the army and the SB.^^ 

WITH MARTIAL LAW as the only solution favored by 
the Kremlin to deal with the Solidarity crisis, the role of 
the Polish army became of crucial importance. On 



February 9, probably as a result of Soviet pressure, the 
minister of defense, General Wojciech Jaruzelski became 
Polish prime minister. Slim, erect, habitually wearing 
dark glasses and an inscrutable expression, Jaruzelski was 
an enigmatic figure for most Poles. But he had a relatively 
favorable public image due both to the fact that he had 
refused to use troops against the workers in 1970 and to 
the reputation of the armed forces as the most trusted state 
institution. In KGB reports to Brezhnev, however, 
Jaruzelski had long been described as “a sincere friend of 
the Soviet Union.” On his instructions, the chief of 
military intelligence. General Czeslaw Kiszczak (later 
interior minister in charge of the SB), had for some time 
been meeting the KGB mission in Warsaw every two or 
three days to provide the latest intelligence reports on the 
crisis from military sources. As Prime Minister, 
Jaruzelski retained the defense portfolio. 

The period up to December 1981 was to be 
characterized by recurrent Soviet complaints of Polish 
inaction and Polish attempts to placate the Soviet 
leadership. During that period the Kremlin was assailed 
by recurrent doubts as to whether Jaruzelski really 
possessed the resolve required to enforce martial law. In 
the end it concluded that no better candidate was 
available. Soviet doubts about Kania, however, were to 
prove much more serious. 

On March 4 Kania and Jaruzelski were summoned to 
the Kremlin to be dressed down by Brezhnev and other 



members of the Politburo. When, the Soviet leaders 
demanded, would the Polish comrades impose martial 
law? And how was it that, alone among the Socialist 
countries, Poland found it so difficult to control the 
Church? The dressing-down had little effect. A member 
of the Polish Politburo, Mieczyslaw Moczar, informed the 
KGB that Kania had told him, shortly after his return to 
Warsaw, “In spite of the pressure from Moscow, I don’t 
want to use force against the opposition. I don’t want to 
go down in history as the butcher of the Polish people.” 
According to another of the KGB’s Polish informants, 
Kania said that neither the Party nor the government was 
ready for a confrontation with Solidarity — “and I’ll never 
ask the Russians for military assistance. 

“We have huge worries about the outcome of events in 
Poland,” Brezhnev told the Politburo on April 2. “Worst 
of all is that our friends listen and agree with our 
recommendations, but in practice they don’t do anything. 
And a counter-revolution is taking the offensive on all 
fronts!” Ustinov, the defense minister, declared that if 
Socialism was to survive in Poland, “bloodshed is 
unavoidable.” “Solidarity,” reported Andropov, “is now 
starting to grab one position after the other.” The only 
solution was renewed pressure on the Poles to declare 
martial law: 

We have to tell them that martial law means a 

curfew, limited movement in the city streets. 



strengthening state security [the SB] in Party 
institutions, factories, etc. The pressure from the 
leaders of Solidarity has left Jaruzelski in terribly 
bad shape, while lately Kania has begun to drink 
more and more. This is a very sad phenomenon. I 
want to point out that Polish events are having an 
influence on the western areas of our country too . . . 
Here, too, weTl have to take tough internal 
measures. 

Next day Kania and Jaruzelski were summoned to meet 
Andropov and Ustinov in the Soviet equivalent of a 
Pullman railway coach at the border city of Brest-Litovsk. 
After caviar and a sumptuous buffet, they were seated at a 
green-baize-covered table and subjected to six hours of 
recriminations, demands for the declaration of martial law 
and threats of Soviet military intervention. Kania and 
Jaruzelski responded by pleading for more time.^^ On 
April 7, four days after the meeting at Brest-Litovsk, 
Mieczyslaw Moczar had another conversation with Kania 
which he reported to the KGB. Kania clearly believed that 
the threat of military intervention was in deadly earnest. 
“There would be a tragedy on a huge scale if Soviet forces 
intervene,” he told Moczar. “It would take two 
generations of Poles to remedy the consequences.”^^ 

The Soviet Politburo believed that such a threat of 
military intervention was the main restraining influence 
on Polish “anti- Socialist forces.” On April 23 it approved 



a report on Poland which concluded: 


Solidarity has been transformed into an organized 
political force, which has the capacity to paralyze the 
activity of the Party and state organs and take de 
facto power into its own hands. If the opposition has 
not yet done this, that is primarily because of its fear 
that Soviet troops would be introduced and because 
of its hopes that it can achieve its aims without 
bloodshed and by means of a creeping counter- 
revolution. 

The Politburo agreed, “as a deterrent to counter- 
revolution,” to “exploit to the utmost the fears of internal 
reactionaries and international imperialism that the Soviet 
Union might send its troops into Poland.” It also decided 
to maintain “support for Comrades Kania and Jaruzelski, 
who, despite their well-known waffling, are in favor of 
defending Socialism.” They must, however, be put under 
“constant pressure to pursue more significant and decisive 
actions to overcome the crisis and preserve Poland as a 
Socialist country friendly to the Soviet Union. 

On May 13 John Paul II gave his usual Wednesday 
general audience in St. Peter’s Square. As he was waving 
to the crowds from his open-topped “Popemobile,” he 
was shot from a distance of twenty feet by a Turkish 
would-be assassin, Mehmet Ali Agca. The bullet passed a 
few millimeters from the Pope’s central aorta; had it hit 



his aorta, the Pope would have died instantly. John Paul II 
believed that his life had been saved by a miracle 
performed by the Virgin of Fatima in Portugal, whose 
feast day it was. On the first anniversary of the 
assassination attempt, he made a pilgrimage to Fatima to 
place Agca’s bullet on her altar. If the Pope had died, 
the KGB would doubtless have been overjoyed. But there 
is no evidence in any of the files examined by Mitrokhin 
that it was involved in the attempt on his life.^^ 

In the weeks after the assassination attempt, the 
strongest pressure on Kania and Jaruzelski to declare 
martial law came from Marshal Viktor Kulikov, the short- 
tempered commander-in-chief of Warsaw Pact forces. 
Kulikov accused Jaruzelski of cowardice. “You yourself. 
Comrade Jaruzelski,” he told him, “are afraid of taking 
decisive action.” Though insisting that the time was not 
ripe for martial law, Jaruzelski accepted Kulikov’s insults 
— according to a KGB report to the Politburo — with 
remarkable meekness and even offered to resign as prime 
minister.^^ Kulikov remained deeply suspicious of the 
motives of both Kania and Jaruzelski, reporting to the 
Politburo, “It looks as though the leadership of the PUWP 
and the government is conducting a dishonest political 
game and is facilitating the accession to power of those 
backing Solidarity.”^^ 

The Centre informed the Warsaw KGB mission that the 
time had come to find both a new first secretary and a 



new prime minister: 


Kania and Jamzelski are no longer capable of 
leading Party and government effectively. They 
cannot organize the defeat of the opposition, and 
have been compromised by cooperating for many 
years with Gierek. There is no doubt that they do not 
even have the fighting qualities which are essential 
for political leaders capable of taking decisive 
measures. 

The Centre’s preferred candidates on the Polish Politburo 
to succeed Kania and Jamzelski were the hardliners 
Tadeusz Grabski and Stefan Olszowski. Both, it reported, 
“are imbued with a firm Marxist-Leninist outlook, and are 
prepared to act decisively and consistently in defense of 
Socialist interests and of friendship with the Soviet 
Union. On May 30 Aristov and Pavlov sent a joint 
telegram to Brezhnev and the Politburo, accusing Kania 
and Jamzelski of consistent capitulation to “revisionist 
elements”: 

The present situation requires urgent consideration of 
the necessity of dismissing [Kania] from his post as 
first secretary of the central committee and replacing 
him with a comrade capable of ensuring the survival 
of the Party’s Marxist-Leninist nature and of the 
Socialist character of the Polish state . . . An analysis 



of the mood of Party activists shows that the most 
suitable candidate for post of first secretary of the 
PUWP central committee is Comrade T. Grabski.^^ 

Having discovered that the KGB was plotting against 
him, Kania lapsed into a tone of almost whimpering self- 
pity. When Pavlov phoned him on June 7 to ask if he 
proposed to ring Comrade Brezhnev to reply to another 
letter from Moscow demanding tough action against 
Solidarity, Kania replied, “There is probably now no point 
in my telephoning as everything has already been decided 
without me [being consulted].” Later that night Kania 
rang Pavlov back at home in order to appeal for 
sympathy: 

At this very moment your people [the KGB] are 
saying that it is necessary to speak up at the Plenum 
[of the PUWP central committee] against Kania and 
Jaruzelski ... You do not have, and you never have 
had, more trustworthy friends than me and Jaruzelski 
... I am amazed at the method you have chosen for 
dealing with me. I do not deserve this . . . There is no 
need to mobilize the members of the Central 
Committee against me. It is clear that I shall be on 
the side of the CPSU ... It is very bitter sensation 
for me to realize that I have lost your trust. I feel hurt 
that you have chosen such a roundabout way to 
mobilize opinion for an attack on me at the Plenum. I 



therefore find it difficult to speak to Comrade 
Brezhnev. What can I say to him?^^ 


When Kulikov asked Jaruzelski for his reaction to the 
latest philippic from Moscow, he replied, “They are 
hammering me into the ground. I’m a fool for accepting 
this post [of prime minister]. 

During June a group of nine Polish generals 
approached the KGB with a plan to remove Jaruzelski 
because of his unwillingness to order martial law and 
replace him with a new defense minister (presumably one 
of the plotters), who would arrest the rest of the 
government, take control of strategic points and seize up 
to 3,000 counter-revolutionaries who would be deported 
to elsewhere in the Soviet Bloc. An action group led by 
the defense minister, containing no members of either the 
previous government or the Politburo, would then appeal 
to the rest of the Soviet Bloc for “military assistance to 
protect Socialism in the Polish People’s Republic. 
Moscow’s response to the plan for a military coup is not 
recorded in the files noted by Mitrokhin. Given its desire 
to avoid “military assistance” and preserve a semblance of 
legality, however, it cannot have been attracted by it. 

Jaruzelski ’s main concern seems to have been less his 
own personal position than to prevent the disaster of 
Soviet military intervention. On June 22 he held a 
meeting with the minister of the interior. General 
Milewski, whom he knew was trusted by the Kremlin. 



How, asked Jamzelski, could he “regain the trust of our 
Soviet comrades?” Milewski replied that, though Soviet 
confidence in the Polish leadership had been severely 
damaged, it had not been entirely destroyed: “If there had 
been none at all, they would have stopped talking to us.” 
Jamzelski complained that, so far as he was concerned, 
they had indeed stopped talking. Previously, Kulikov had 
phoned him almost every day and had frequently come to 
see him. Recently he had broken all contact. Soviet 
representatives in Warsaw were instmcted to tell 
Jamzelski that their confidence in him had indeed been 
shaken and that it would disappear altogether unless he 
mended his ways.^^ 

Centre files record that in the weeks before the opening 
of the Ninth PUWP Congress on July 14, the Soviet 
embassy, the KGB mission and Soviet military 
representatives “worked among the delegates to identify 
Party members who followed the Marxist-Leninist line, to 
establish personal contact with them, and through them to 
influence the course of the Congress. The Suslov 
Commission, set up by the Politburo a year earlier to 
monitor the Polish crisis, gave instmctions that the threat 
of military intervention by the other members of the 
Warsaw Pact must be “a constant factor in the minds of 
all Polish political forces. On the eve of the congress, 
the Centre instmcted Pavlov, the head of the KGB 
mission in Warsaw, to have “a straightforward 



conversation with S. Kania and Jamzelski on their weak 
Party and government work, and remind them of their 
earlier statements of readiness to cede their Party and 
government jobs if necessary in the interest of saving the 
Socialist system in Poland and the unity of Socialist 
cooperation in Europe.” The choice of Kama’s successor, 
in the Centre’s view, lay among three leading hardliners: 
Tadeusz Grabski, Stefan Olszowski and Andrzej 
Zabinski. All other representatives of “healthy forces” in 
the PUWP lacked the necessary authority to become first 
secretary. The KGB also drew up a list of those suitable 
for election to the Politburo and a hit list of moderates to 
be removed from the government and Party posts. Top of 
the hit list was the deputy prime minister, Mieczyslaw 
Rakowski, who had threatened to inform the leaders of 
the Italian and French Communist Parties about Soviet 
interference in the internal affairs of the PUWP. The 
Centre concluded that, in view of Jamzelski ’s continuing 
“authority in the country and especially in the army,” it 
would be unwise simply to dismiss him. Rather, it was 
hoped to kick him upstairs to the less powerful post of 
president and harness his personal prestige in support of a 
hardline government. 

So far as Moscow was concerned, however, the Ninth 
PUWP Congress failed to go according to plan. Faced 
with a blatant Soviet attempt to unseat Kania, the 
congress rallied round him. But, taking seriously the 
threat of Soviet invasion, the congress also retained 



among the leadership some of the chief supporters of the 
Soviet campaign of intimidation. And though it gave loud 
applause to Rakowski’s speech, it dared not antagonize 
the Kremlin by electing him to the Politburo. The main 
consequence of the contradictory outcome of the congress 
was a near paralysis of government. Women and children 
marched through Polish cities banging empty pans to 
protest against food shortages. Encouraged by Solidarity, 
industrial workers elected factory councils which claimed 
the right to choose their managers. 

The worsening crisis of central government seems to 
have convinced Jaruzelski that martial law would soon 
become inevitable. Detailed plans were agreed with 
Kulikov early in August. At a meeting with Jaruzelski and 
senior Polish generals on August 12, Kulikov demanded 
“firmness and still more firmness. On August 21 the 
new hardline interior minister. General Czeslaw Kiszczak, 
formerly head of military intelligence, visited Moscow to 
report personally to Andropov on secret preparations by 
the SB and police for the introduction of martial law. 
Hitherto, he acknowledged, “The Polish leadership has 
handled Solidarity as if it were an egg which it was afraid 
to break. We must put a stop to this.”^^ 

Kiszczak and the SB no longer saw Walesa as the main 
problem. During the previous six months Walesa’s 
leadership had become somewhat lackluster as he 
struggled to recover a clear sense of direction. Solidarity 



ultimately had to choose between two strategic options: 
either it had to become a truly revolutionary body capable 
of overthrowing the Communist one-party state, or it had 
to accommodate itself to the system and be content with 
winning a few concessions. Walesa found himself unable 
to opt clearly for either option. He had backed away from 
a general strike in March when most other leading figures 
in Solidarity believed the time had come for a showdown. 
Zbigniew Bujak, chairman of Solidarity in the Warsaw 
region, concluded that Walesa had made a fatal mistake: 

General strikes are like swords — once you take them 
out of the scabbard and fail to use them, they are no 
more use than useless hunks of iron. Walesa in effect 
demobilized the union ... It deprived us of our basic 
weapon and thus became the source of our 
subsequent defeat. The authorities counted on this 
when they prepared the martial law operation of 
December 13.^^ 

Kiszczak told Andropov that, though Walesa might use 
aggressive language to appeal to Solidarity “extremists,” 
his thinking was relatively moderate. The main danger 
now came from Bujak, who was both “anti- Socialist and 
anti- Soviet:” “He is cleverer than Walesa and is closely 
linked with [the KOR leaders] Kuron and Michnik. The 
task of the [SB] agencies is to discredit him.” 



“AT THE PRESENT time,” Kiszczak told Andropov, 
“the Roman Catholic Church does not represent a threat 
to the PUWP.” Milewski had devoted “immense efforts” 
to the agent penetration of the Church, and the SB was 
now well-informed about its mood and intentions: “Out of 
seventy bishops, good contacts are maintained with fifty. 
This makes it possible to bring influence to bear on the 
Catholic Church and to prevent undesirable moves.”^^ 
The recent death of the 80-year-old Primate, Cardinal 
Wyszynski, a friend of Solidarity and for over a 
generation a courageous defender of religious freedom, 
had come as an immense relief to the SB (and doubtless 
to the KGB): 

The new Primate, [Cardinal Jozef] Glemp, is not as 
anti-Soviet as his predecessor. Wyszynski enjoyed 
immense authority; his word was law. He was the 
object of a personality cult and his cult exceeded 
anything imaginable. Glemp is a different kind of 
man and there are undoubtedly possibilities of 
exerting influence on him. 

Two problems, however, remained in Church-state 
relations. The first was the Pope, who — according to 
Kiszczak — was cleverly exploiting the situation in Poland 
to advance his anti-Communist policies in eastern Europe. 
The second problem was the moral authority of the Polish 
Church. The people looked on the Church, not the Party, 



as the “standard-bearer of morality.” “In the immediate 
future,” Kiszczak admitted, “the Party will not be able to 
change the attitude towards the Catholic Church.” 

Andropov seems to have hectored Kiszczak rather less 
than most other Polish leaders he had met over the 
previous few years. But he ended their meeting in somber 
mood: 

The class enemy has repeatedly tried to challenge the 
people’s power in the Socialist countries . . . But the 
Polish crisis is the most long drawn out, and perhaps 
the most dangerous. The adversary’s creeping 
counter-revolution has long been preparing for the 
struggle with Socialism.^^ 

Solidarity’s first national congress (held in two sessions 
from September 5 to 10 and from September 26 to 
October 7) provided further evidence of “creeping 
counter-revolution.” Its appeal on September 8 “to the 
working people of eastern Europe . . . who have entered 
the difficult road to struggle for a free trade union 
movemenf’ was denounced by the SB as “a brazen 
attempt to interfere in the internal affairs of Socialist 
countries. 

Pavlov now seemed satisfied that Jaruzelski was 
prepared for “decisive measures” to end “the threat from 
Solidarity.” On September 29 he reported to the Centre 
that he had “advised” Jaruzelski on the line to follow at 



the plenary meeting of the Central Committee on October 
18.^^ The first priority was to get rid of Kania, who, 
Pavlov reported, continued to pursue “a policy of 
conciliation” towards Solidarity. Having failed to secure 
Kama’s dismissal at the July Party congress, Moscow was 
determined to succeed at the October Central Committee 
plenum. The Centre must have been particularly outraged 
by Pavlov’s account of a secret briefing on Kama’s policy 
given by his supporter. Deputy Prime Minister Kazimierz 
Barcikowski, on October 2, 1981. According to 
Barcikowski, Kania was “disenchanted with the Soviet 
model of Socialism”: 

The Soviet system of Socialism had failed the test. 
The fact that the USSR was systematically buying 
grain in the West was an indication of serious errors 
in the management of agriculture . . . The power of 
the Soviet regime was maintained only through the 
army and other agencies of coercion. However, in 
the last two or three years, the situation had begun to 
change to the Soviet Union’s disadvantage. China 
was significantly strengthening its military power; its 
military and economic contacts with the USA were a 
serious threat to the USSR, and pinned down a large 
number of troops on the far eastern borders. In the 
last few months, the situation in Afghanistan had 
sharply deteriorated. It was now clear that it would 
be impossible to win this conflict politically without 



the use of mass repressive measures similar to those 
used by the Americans in Vietnam. If at the present 
time the USSR still had some strategic advantage 
over the USA, within three or four years it would 
lose it, as the Soviet economy would no longer be 
able to meet the additional expense of developing 
and producing new types of armaments. 

The imposition of the Soviet model of socialism had, 
Kania believed, “bureaucratized the PUWP” and distorted 
Leninist principles: 

He regarded it as his main task to do everything to 
protect the positive processes taking place in Poland, 
including the Solidarity movement, in order to create 
a basis for genuine Socialism which, with certain 
variations, could also find a place in other Socialist 
countries. 

Even Dubcek during the Prague Spring had never made 
such a devastating indictment of the Soviet system. 

Pavlov’s detailed reports on Kania indicate either that 
his home had been bugged or that there was an informer 
in his immediate family. He informed the Centre that on 
October 5, “Kania came home in a very agitated state and 
told a narrow circle of his family that the Russian 
comrades are again plotting to remove him from the post 
of First Secretary.” Kania claimed not to understand why 



his Soviet “friends” did not tell him frankly that he must 
resign. If they did so, he would go “without causing a 
fuss.” According to the KGB, Kama’s wife was deeply 
disturbed by his state of mind and anxious for him to 
resign so that he could recover his health and cease to be 
“a persecuted politician.” But Pavlov did not believe that 
Kania really intended to go quietly. He reported on 
October 7 that Kania had instructed Kiszczak to take 
action against a number of Party members who, he 
believed (no doubt correctly), were plotting against him.^^ 
Kiszczak, however, sided with Jaruzelski and the plotters. 

Kania’ s fate was sealed at a stormy confrontation with 
Jaruzelski, Kiszczak, Milewski (now secretary of the 
PUWP central committee) and two other Polish generals. 
Jaruzelski told him that, unless he agreed to preparations 
for martial law, they would go ahead behind his back — 
and “decisive” (but unspecified) action would be taken 
against him personally.^^ On the morning of October 18, 
just before the opening of the plenary meeting of the 
central committee, Aristov informed Kania that it was the 
“unanimous view” in Moscow that he should be replaced 
as first secretary by Jaruzelski.^^ The central committee 
duly did Moscow’s bidding, and Kania gave way without 
a struggle. According to KGB reports, Kania said after his 
dismissal that he was still haunted by memories of the 
shooting of strikers in 1970. If he had remained first 
secretary, he would never have been able to give the order 



to open fire again.^^ 

Next day, October 19, Brezhnev telephoned Jamzelski 
to congratulate him on his appointment as first secretary, 
while keeping his existing posts as prime minister and 
defense minister. “Hello, Wojciech,” Brezhnev began. 
“Hello, my dear, deeply esteemed Leonid Ilyich!” 
Jamzelski replied. He maintained the same sycophantic 
tone throughout the conversation: 

Thank you very much, dear Leonid Ilyich, for the 
greeting and above all for the confidence you have in 
me. I want to tell you frankly that I had some inner 
misgivings about accepting this post and agreed to 
do so only because I knew that you support me and 
that you were in favor of this decision. If this had not 
been so, I would never have agreed to it. 

Jamzelski added that, later in the day, he would be 
meeting Aristov to discuss the situation in detail and 
would “be asking for your suggestions on some questions 
which he, no doubt, will convey to you.” Lying 
effortlessly, Brezhnev told Jamzelski that the CPSU 
Politburo had realized long ago that he was the right man 
for the job. Predictably, he made no mention of the fact 
that in the course of the summer the KGB had 
recommended sacking Jamzelski as well as Kania. In the 
end, however, the Politburo had reluctantly concluded 
that only Jamzelski possessed the authority to declare 



martial law.^^ 

Soviet doubts about Jamzelski, however, continued. On 
November 4 Jamzelski began talks with Walesa and 
Archbishop Glemp at which he proposed their 
participation in a Front of National Accord which, while it 
would have no decision-making powers, would keep open 
dialogue between the state. Church and unions. Though 
Pavlov and Aristov were in favor of tactics designed to 
damp down any suspicion by Walesa and Glemp that 
martial law was imminent, they feared that Jamzelski 
would end by making real concessions. On November 13 
they sent a joint telegram to the Politburo condemning 
Jamzelski ’s indecisiveness and his attempt to conciliate 
Walesa, and urging that he be pressed yet again to declare 
martial law without further delay. On november 21 the 
Politburo approved the text of a personal message from 
Brezhnev to Jamzelski, berating him for his inaction: 

The anti- Socialist forces are not only gaining sway in 
many large industrial enterprises, but are also 
continuing to spread their influence among ever 
wider segments of the population. Worse still, the 
leaders of Solidarity and the counter-revolutionaries 
are still appearing before various audiences and 
making openly inflammatory speeches aimed at 
stirring up nationalist passions and directed against 
the PUWP and against Socialism. The direct 
consequence of this is the dangerous growth of anti- 



Sovietism in Poland. 

. . . The leaders of the anti- Socialist forces ... are 
placing great store by the fact that a new group of 
recruits will be entering the army who have been 
worked on by Solidarity. Doesn’t this suggest to you 
that a failure to take harsh measures against the 
counter-revolutionaries right away will cost you 
valuable time?^^ 

Jaruzelski seems finally to have given way to Soviet 
pressure at the beginning of December. He told a meeting 
of the PUWP Politburo on December 5 that, after thirty- 
six years of the “people’s power” in Poland, there sadly 
seemed no alternative to using “police methods” against 
the working class. The Politburo unanimously accepted 
the need to declare martial law.^^ The main details of its 
implementation were worked out under the supervision of 
Kiszczak,^^ who briefed Pavlov on December 7. One 
hundred and fifty- seven SB and other interior ministry 
personnel had been sent around the provinces in groups of 
up to five to ensure that preparations had been made to 
isolate and arrest Solidarity leaders and other 
“extremists.” Pavlov reported to the Centre that the SB 
had agents “at all levels of Solidarity,” and intended that, 
where possible, these agents should step into the shoes of 
the arrested activists. Their main task after the declaration 
of martial law would be to prevent workers from going on 



strike or taking to the streets. Suspect members of the 
government and Party leadership were placed under close 
SB surveillance. Kania’s former supporter, Barcikowski, 
told his friends that the SB followed him wherever he 
went and recorded all his telephone calls. 

On the night of December 8-9 Jaruzelski briefed 
Marshal Kulikov on the timetable for martial law. 
Approximately 80,000 personnel had been selected to 
arrest 6,000 Solidarity activists on the night of either 
December 11-12 or 12-13. Troops would begin moving 
from their barracks at 6 a.m. on the morning after the 
arrests. Though the plans appeared resolute, however, 
Jaruzelski did not. “During our discussions,” Kulikov 
reported, “W. Jaruzelski ’s indecisiveness and wavering 
and his apprehension about the successful implementation 
of the plan to impose martial law were palpable.” The 
PUWP, Jaruzelski complained, had little authority left. 
Six to seven hundred thousand of its members were 
associated with Solidarity, and it was compromised by 
numerous instances of theft, bribery and other abuses of 
the people’s trust. For martial law to succeed, it might be 
necessary for him to appeal for assistance from Warsaw 
Pact forces — though he asked for East German troops not 
to be used. “I can assure you that you have no need for 
concern on that score,” Kulikov told him. “The question 
of assisting you in the event that your own resources 
become exhausted is being addressed at General Staff 



level. 

On December 9 Milewski brought Pavlov further 
evidence of Jaruzelski’s anxious state of mind. Jaruzelski 
had still not set a date for the introduction of martial law. 
If the Church opposed martial law, Jaruzelski had told 
him, Glemp would turn into “a second Khomeini. Next 
day the CPSU Politburo met in emergency session to 
discuss the Polish crisis. It began by hearing a report from 
Nikolai Baibakov of Gosplan, just returned from a visit to 
Warsaw to discuss Poland’s appeal for economic 
assistance. Jaruzelski, Baibakov reported, had become an 
“extremely neurotic” wreck, terrified that Glemp would 
declare a holy war. Though all the Politburo members 
who spoke after Baibakov made scathing criticisms of 
Jaruzelski, none suggested trying to replace him. It was 
plainly too late for that. There was general agreement, 
too, that Soviet forces must not intervene. Andropov 
declared bluntly: 

If Comrade Kulikov actually did speak about the 
introduction of troops, then I believe he did this 
incorrectly. We can’t risk such a step. We don’t 
intend to introduce troops into Poland. That is the 
proper position, and we must adhere to it until the 
end. I don’t know how things will turn out in Poland, 
but even if Poland falls under the control of 
Solidarity, that’s the way it will be.^^ 



Jamzelski complained to Milewski and others that, by 
refusing to allow Warsaw Pact military intervention if 
Polish security forces proved unable to cope, the Soviet 
Politburo had let him down: 

They pressed us to take firm and decisive action, and 
the Soviet leaders promised to provide all the 
assistance and support needed. But now, when we 
have made a firm decision to take action and we 
would like to discuss it with the Soviet leaders, we 
cannot get a concrete answer from the Soviet 
comrades. 

Jamzelski was gloomy about the prospects for martial law 
without Soviet military support. “We’re about to go on 
the offensive,” he told Milewski, “but I’m afraid that later 
on we’ll be branded as conspirators and hanged.” 
Milewski rang Andropov to report what Jamzelski had 
said.^^ 

Until the very last moment Moscow continued to fear 
that Jamzelski’ s nerve would crack. On December 11 
Aristov, Kulikov and Pavlov jointly reported to the 
Politburo that all the preparations for “operation X” (the 
enforcement of martial law) had been completed. But: 

In view of W. Jamzelski ’s inclination toward 
vacillation and doubt, we can’t exclude the 
possibility that, under pressure from the episcopate 



and other forces, he may refuse to take the final 
decision and will pursue the line of making 
concessions and agreements. In the light of the 
current situation, such a step could prove fatal for the 
PUWP and for the future of Socialism in Poland. 

On Saturday December 12 Jaruzelski telephoned 
Brezhnev and Suslov, asked for and received their 
approval for operation X to begin that evening. The 
KGB mission in Warsaw, however, was still not 
convinced that Jaruzelski would go ahead. He continued 
to agonize over whether the loss of life which might be 
necessary to prevent Solidarity turning Poland into “a 
bourgeois state” could possibly be justified. And if 
martial law failed, he was convinced that all those 
responsible for declaring it would be “physically 
eliminated.” “If we fail,” said Jaruzelski, “there will be 
nothing left for me to do but to put a bullet in my head.”^^ 
Pavlov also reported that if Jaruzelski’ s nerve failed, 
Olszowski was prepared to stage a coup — ^provided he 
had the backing of Moscow. Olszowski ’s plan of action 
included the immediate arrest of Solidarity leaders; the 
prohibition of strikes and protests; the confiscation of 
food supplies in the countryside; close “economic 
cooperation” with the Soviet Union; the enforcement of 
martial law throughout the country; and the sealing of 
Polish borders.^^ 



To Pavlov’s relief, Kiszczak, who was in charge of 
implementing operation X, appeared much more resolute 
than Jaruzelski. In the course of Saturday December 12 he 
provided the KGB with the detailed timetable of the 
operation. At 11:30 p.m., telephone communications 
throughout the country would be shut down; all embassies 
would lose their landline connections; communications 
abroad would cease; and the borders would be closed. 
Foreign reporters without permanent accreditation would 
be expelled. The arrests would begin at midnight. Four 
thousand two hundred would be detained overnight and 
another 4,500 placed in “protective custody” on Sunday 
December 13. Walesa would be asked to enter talks with 
the government and arrested if he refused. In a broadcast 
at 6 a.m. Jaruzelski would declare martial law and 
announce the creation of a “Military Council for National 
Salvation.” In order to keep people at home and off the 
streets on Sunday, church services would — ^unusually — be 
televised. If necessary, Monday December 14 would be 
declared a public holiday. The security forces had orders 
to open fire if they encountered serious resistance. But, 
Kiszczak warned, there was no guarantee of success: 

If the operation that we have undertaken fails, if we 
have to pay with our lives, then the Soviet Union 
will have to be ready to face a hostile state on its 
western border, whose leaders will promote 
nationalism and anti-Sovietism. From the outset they 



will receive energetic assistance from the imperialist 
states to an extent sufficient for them to sever all ties 
with Socialist countries. Poland’s Socialist 
development would be put into reverse for a long 
period.^^ 

In the event, the enforcement of martial law went more 
smoothly than Jaruzelski had dared to hope. Kryuchkov, 
who had arrived from Moscow to observe operation X at 
first hand, must also have been pleasantly surprised. 
Solidarity was caught off-guard, with most of its leading 
activists asleep in bed when the security forces arrived to 
arrest them. Zbigniew Bujak, the most senior Solidarity 
leader to escape arrest and go underground, said later, 
“The authorities were clearly planning a sizeable 
operation against the union. But we never thought it 
would be as serious as this.” There had been so much talk 
about the growing powerlessness of the Polish 
government that Solidarity had begun to believe its own 
rhetoric. Poles awoke on Sunday morning to find an army 
checkpoint at every crossroads and declarations of martial 
law posted to every street comer. Jamzelski’s 6 a.m. 
broadcast was repeated throughout the day, interspersed 
with Chopin polonaises and patriotic music. Television 
viewers saw Jamzelski, dressed in army uniform, sitting 
at a desk in front of a large Polish flag. “Citizens and lady 
citizens of the Polish People’s Republic!” he began. “I 
speak to you as a soldier and head of government! Our 



motherland is on the verge of an abyss Many 
interpreted his speech as a warning that only martial law 
could save Poland from a Soviet invasion. 

In the early hours of the morning Walesa had been 
taken by military escort, accompanied by the minister of 
labor, Stanislaw Ciosek, to a villa on the outskirts of 
Warsaw. Walesa later recalled that he was addressed as 
“Mr. Chairman,” there were apologies for the 
inconvenience to which he was being put and the razor 
was removed from the villa’s marble bathroom in case he 
was tempted to commit suicide. Later in the day Ciosek 
reported to the PUWP Politburo that Walesa was in a state 
of shock, had said that his role as chairman of Solidarity 
was at an end and that the union would have to be 
reorganized. He was also alleged to be willing to 
cooperate with the government. Kiszczak passed on the 
good news to the KGB mission. Milewski exultantly 
told Pavlov and Kryuchkov, “Walesa cannot hide his 
terror! In reality, though stunned by the suddenness of 
the declaration of martial law, Walesa is unlikely to have 
panicked. He had been arrested over a dozen times before 
and his wife Danuta was accustomed to the routine of 
packing a holdall for him to take to prison. 

While Walesa was being installed in the government 
villa, Glemp was being visited by Kazimierz 
Barcikowski, secretary of the Polish Central Committee 
and president of the Joint Commission for the State and 



the Episcopate, and Jerzy Kuberski, Minister of Religious 
Affairs, to be informed of the impending declaration of 
martial law. Since no telephones were operating, they had 
arrived unannounced at 3 a.m. at the archbishop’s palace, 
where a patrolman rang the doorbell repeatedly until at 
last a light went on inside, Glemp was woken and a nun 
came to let them in. “The whole thing,” said Barcikowski, 
“was a bit theatrical. Contrary to Jaruzelski’s alarmist 
forecasts, Glemp showed no inclination to declare a holy 
war and no desire to become “a Polish Khomeini.” 
Milewski informed Kryuchkov and Pavlov that Glemp 
had reacted calmly, with “a certain degree of 
understanding.” Though the declaration of martial law did 
not surprise him, he had not expected it to occur until 
after the Christmas holiday s.^^ 

The immediate concern of the authorities had been the 
homily that Glemp was due to give on Sunday afternoon 
at the Jesuit church of Mary Mother of God in Warsaw’s 
Old City.^^ They need not have worried. The keynote of 
Glemp ’s sermon was caution. “Opposition to the 
decisions of the authorities under martial law,” he warned, 
“could cause violent reprisals, including bloodshed, 
because the authorities have the armed forces at their 
disposal . . . There is nothing of greater value than human 
life.” “The Primate’s words,” writes historian Timothy 
Garton Ash, “were bitterly resented by many Christian 
Poles who were, at that moment, preparing to risk their 



own lives for what they considered greater values.” 
Jamzelski, by contrast, felt an enormous sense of relief 
Glemp’s homily was broadcast repeatedly on television, 
printed in the Party newspaper and put up on the walls of 
army barracks. 

On the first day of martial law, Brezhnev rang 
Jamzelski to congratulate him on the beginning of 
operation Kryuchkov, Pavlov and Kulikov jointly 
telegraphed from Warsaw that the first stages of the 
operation had been successfully completed. “But the most 
dangerous days,” they believed, “will be Monday, 
Tuesday, and Wednesday of the coming week [December 
14-16] when Solidarity activists who are still at large will 
try to spread disorder among workers and students. 
“During the next two weeks,” Jamzelski told Kryuchkov, 
“a great deal will depend on the market situation.” The 
best antidote to Solidarity would be well-stocked shelves 
in Polish shops for Christmas. He appealed to Moscow to 
send shoes, children’s toys and other consumer goods as 
quickly as possible: “Any material aid now will cost 
much less than the expenditure required by the Polish 
situation if the unthinkable began to happen here.”^^ 

The worst violence after the declaration of martial law 
took place at a coal mine near Katowice, where more than 
2,000 miners began a sit-in. On Tuesday December 15 
helicopters dropped tear gas into the mines, while ZOMO 
paramilitary police from the ministry of the interior. 



supported by forty tanks, began firing rubber bullets at the 
miners. The security forces then attacked the doctors and 
ambulance drivers who came to tend the wounded. 
Seven miners were killed and thirty-nine injured; forty- 
one ZOMO policemen were also injured, though none 
were killed. Overall, however, casualties were much 
lower than the SB and KGB had expected. The mere 
threat of Soviet intervention had proved as effective in 
crushing opposition as the actual Soviet intervention in 
Czechoslovakia thirteen years earlier. By the year’s end 
organized opposition to martial law had virtually 
disappeared. Graffiti on the walls of Polish cities 
proclaimed optimistically, “Winter Is Yours. Spring Will 
be Ours!” But Spring did not truly return until 1989 with 
the formation of a Solidarity-led government and the 
disintegration of the Communist one-party state. 

Jaruzelski gave the main credit for the success of 
operation X to the SB, ZOMO and other interior ministry 
personnel. At a meeting in the ministry on December 31 
he praised the SB’s dedication to Socialism and the high 
moral and political qualities of its operational officers. 
“You were the defenders of Socialism in Poland,” 
Jaruzelski told them. “The Polish army contributed to the 
success, but the main work was done by the Interior 
Ministry.” The SB’s principal role now was deep 
penetration of the opposition movement to provide the 
intelligence necessary “to neutralize the adversary by the 
swiftest possible means.” In answer to a question about 



the “mildness” of the sentences passed on the strike 
organizers at Katowice and elsewhere, Jamzelski said 
that, though he was personally in favor of more severe 
punishment, public opinion had to be taken into account: 
“If we were to impose excessively severe sentences, say 
ten to twelve years’ imprisonment, people would say that 
we were taking our revenge on Solidarity. So we have to 
be content with moderate sentences.” As usual, an 
account of the meeting was forwarded to the Centre by 
the KGB mission in Warsaw. 

According to self-congratulatory SB statistics supplied 
to the KGB, during the year after the declaration of 
martial law, 701 underground opposition groups were 
identified, 430 of them associated with the now-illegal 
Solidarity; 10,131 individuals were interned; over 400 
demonstrations dispersed; 370 illegal printing presses and 
1,200 items of printing equipment confiscated; the 
distribution of over 1.2 million leaflets prevented; and 12 
underground Solidarity radio stations closed down. A 
total of 250,000 members of the security forces were 
allegedly deployed on these operations, among them 
90,000 members of police reserve units, over 30,000 
soldiers and 10,000 members of the volunteer police 
reserve. The figures for the deployment of security 
forces, however, are suspiciously high and may well have 
been substantially inflated in order to impress Moscow. 
Jamzelski commended all those who had taken part in the 
enforcement of martial law as intrepid defenders of Polish 



Socialism. 

The SB’s biggest problem was Walesa, whose 
worldwide celebrity made it impossible either to subject 
him to a show trial or to treat him with the casual brutality 
meted out to less well-known Solidarity activists. (Even 
Walesa’s wife Danuta and their small daughters were 
subjected to humiliating strip searches.) As the initial 
shock of internment wore off, however, Walesa’s old 
combative spirit returned and he refused to negotiate with 
the authorities. The SB’s first tactic was to try to persuade 
Walesa to follow the more accommodating policy of 
Cardinal Glemp by giving the Primate’s spokesman. 
Father Alojsy Orszulik, regular access to him.^^ Orszulik 
was initially accompanied by an interior ministry official 
later identified as Colonel Adam Pietruszka, deputy head 
of the SB church department, who three years later was to 
be implicated in the murder of the Solidarity priest Father 
Jerzy Popieluszko. Walesa did not take to Orszulik. When 
urged to give up his resistance to negotiating with the 
Military Council for National Salvation, Walesa shouted, 
‘They’ll come to me on their knees!” Polish Catholics did 
not normally shout at their priests and Orszulik seems to 
have been shocked. According to Walesa, he 
“disapproved of my lack of Christian humility, and it too 
us some time to get used to each other. 

Walesa’s clashes with Orszulik had the advantage, so 
far as the SB was concerned, of alienating Glemp. In 
January 1982 Kiszczak reported to the KGB, with evident 



satisfaction and possibly some exaggeration, that Glemp 
was “completely disenchanted with Walesa,” and believed 
that the leaders of Solidarity “have learned nothing from 
events and refuse to budge from their previous 
positions. The SB also informed the KGB that 
Orszulik’s visits eventually had a “favorable effect” on 
Walesa. As Walesa later acknowledged, he dropped one 
by one all his conditions for negotiating with the 
authorities, “finally aligning himself with the church’s 
position.”^^ 

The SB also tried less subtle methods of influencing 
and discrediting Walesa. While working as a shipyard 
electrician in the early 1970s, Walesa had been in contact 
with the SB. Among the SB files discovered in the early 
1990s after the collapse of the Communist regime was 
one codenamed BOLEK, whose full contents have yet to 
be revealed and whose authenticity remains to be 
established, but which is known to contain alleged details 
of Walesa’s role as an SB informer. According to some 
reports, after seeing a copy of the file in 1992, Walesa, by 
then President of the Polish Republic, began to draft a 
public statement in which he acknowledged that he had 
put his signature to “three or four” SB interrogation 
protocols, but asked for understanding of the difficult 
position of those pressured by the SB to act as informers 
in the 1970s. In the end, it is claimed, Walesa had second 
thoughts and scrapped the statement. 



The KGB files noted by Mitrokhin do not disclose the 
exact extent of Walesa’s cooperation with the SB in the 
1970s. But they do reveal that the SB sought to intimidate 
Walesa after his internment by “reminding him that they 
had paid him money and received information from him.” 
If Walesa did indeed act at one stage of his career as a 
paid informant of the SB, it is easy to imagine the 
pressure exerted on him to do so, as on the millions of 
other informers to Soviet Bloc security services. Kiszczak 
told the KGB that Walesa had been confronted by one of 
his alleged former SB case officers and a conversation 
between them tape-recorded.^^ 

Since the SB did not wish to advertise its vast network 
of willing and unwilling informers, it made only limited 
use of Walesa’s past contact with it in active measures 
intended to discredit him. Instead, it resorted to a series of 
fabrications designed to portray Walesa as a greedy, foul- 
mouthed embezzler. To add authentic detail to its 
forgeries, it stole a tape-recording made by his brother 
Stanislaw during Walesa’s birthday celebrations on 
September 29.^^ On November 11, the anniversary of 
Polish independence, Walesa was freed from internment. 
Moscow was outraged that the news was broadcast in 
Poland at the same time as the announcement of 
Brezhnev’s death the previous day.^^ Kiszczak sought to 
reassure Pavlov that, despite Walesa’s release, active 
measures were still in hand to compromise Wal^sa.^^ 



Jamzelski told Aristov that the material being assembled 
to discredit Walesa included pornographic photographs 
(presumably of Walesa with a mistress) and would expose 
him as “a scheming, grubby individual with gigantic 
ambitions.” Walesa, Jamzelski claimed, had already lost 
half the popular authority he had possessed before his 
internment. Though he remained a potential threat, he no 
longer had his Solidarity base and would be unable to 
rebuild his previous alliance with the church.^^ 

Moscow was far from reassured. Since the 
unexpectedly successful introduction of martial law, 
many of its previous doubts about Jamzelski had 
resurfaced. A KGB agent in Jamzelski’ s entourage 
described him as “the offspring of rich Polish 
landowners” with little sympathy for working people: 
“His tendency is pro- Western and he surrounds himself 
with generals who are descendants of Polish landowners 
and are anti-Soviet in inclination.” The agent (presumably 
something of an anti-Semite) also reported that Jamzelski 
was in contact with “a representative of Polish Zionism”: 
“One should examine whether he himself is not a 
Zionist.” By contrast, Jamzelski “virtually ignored” the 
advice of the Soviet ambassador.^^ 

The reports of both the KGB mission and the Soviet 
embassy during 1982 repeatedly condemned Jamzelski ’s 
tolerance of men with revisionist tendencies in the Polish 
leadership, chief among them Mieczyslaw Rakowski, 
whose allegedly defeatist attitude to anti- Socialist forces 



aroused deep suspicion in Moscow. Rakowski was 
reported to have told the Council of Ministers in June, 
“The PUWP is sick. Martial law made it possible to 
overcome the peak of the opposition, but there is no 
noticeable change for the better in the attitude of broad 
layers of the population.” The strength of the Catholic 
Church meant that a policy of confrontation would be 
mere “adventurism.”^^ A report by Rakowski on June 22 
concluded that there were “100,000 hostile teachers” in 
Polish schools, but that it was impossible to sack them 
all.^^ Jaruzelski was alleged to have told Milewski, “I 
know that Rakowski is a swine, but I still need him.” In a 
telegram to Brezhnev on June 29, however, Aristov 
argued that keeping Rakowski and other like-minded 
individuals in the Polish leadership was “not simply a 
tactical move, but a strategic line for Jaruzelski, who 
shares their position on a number of problems”: “It is 
therefore very important at the present stage to continue to 
exert influence on Comrade W. Jaruzelski. 

Pavlov and Aristov continued to press for more arrests 
and trials of counter-revolutionaries. At a meeting with 
Kiszczak on July 7, Pavlov denounced the policy of the 
interior ministry and the SB as “weak and indecisive.” 
Kiszczak replied that there were 40,000 Solidarity 
activists, and it was impossible to prosecute them all.^^ 
Four days later Aristov brought Jaruzelski a personal 
message from Brezhnev and repeated the Soviet demand 



for more prosecutions. Jaruzelski argued that to try 
Walesa would be impossible because of the international 
as well as Polish outcry it would produce, and that a trial 
of leading opposition figures which excluded Walesa 
would lack credibility. The Polish decision in 
December to suspend (though not yet formally end) 
martial law caused predictable dismay in Moscow. When 
pressed by Aristov to keep it in force, however, Jaruzelski 
delivered something of a lecture, which was duly reported 
to Moscow: 

We cannot continue martial law as if we were living 
in a bunker; we want to pursue a dialogue with the 
people . . . Glemp’s latest statements are such that 
they could even be printed in Trybuna Ludu [the 
Party newspaper]. He appeals for calm, restraint and 
realism ... We are, of course, playing a game with 
the Catholic Church; our aim is to neutralize its 
harmful influence on the population. The aims of the 
Church and my aims are still different. However, at 
this stage we must exploit our common interest in 
stabilizing the situation in order to strengthen 
Socialism and the positions of the Party. 

Jaruzelski ’s attitude to Moscow had become visibly 
less deferential since operation X a year earlier. The KGB 
mission reported that he had declared on one occasion, 
“The Soviet comrades are mistaken if they think that the 



Polish section of the CPSU Central Committee will make 
Polish policy as in the days of Gierek. This will not 
happen. [Those] days are over.”^^^ Jamzelski was, 
initially, favorably impressed by the signs of a new, less 
hectoring style in the Soviet leadership after Brezhnev’s 
death. He told Kiszczak after a meeting in Moscow with 
Andropov, Brezhnev’s successor, in December 1982: 

This was a genuine conversation on an equal footing 
between the leaders of the two Parties and countries, 
not a monologue as was the case earlier with 
Brezhnev. In a conversation lasting three hours, 
Andropov said that all Socialist countries must take 
account of the specific conditions of Poland. The 
Polish problems were not the concern of one country 
alone; it was a world problem. 

Andropov did, however, express concern about the 
continued presence of Rakowski and his fellow moderate, 
Barcikowski, in the Polish leadership. Jamzelski asked 
Andropov to tmst his judgment on how long to keep them 
in office. The fact that Andropov appeared so well 
informed about the Polish situation, Jamzelski believed, 
was due chiefly to reports from the KGB mission in 
Warsaw. 

The KGB mission remained deeply suspicious of 
revisionist tendencies in the Polish leadership. It 
telegraphed the Centre at the end of 1982: 



Rakowski continues to influence Jamzelski. They 
meet constantly to exchange views, not only at work, 
but also at home, and Rakowski was the first person 
Jamzelski met immediately after his return from 
Moscow. 

KGB distmst of Jamzelski continued to grow during 
1983. The Warsaw mission reported that he had given a 
dangerously defeatist address to the PUWP central 
committee on January 12: 

Gierek’s slogans about the moral and ideological 
unity of the Poles, the development of Socialism — 
all this is a fantasy and dreamworld. We have a 
multiparty system. There is an uneven rate of 
development of capitalism, but there is also such a 
thing as the uneven rate of development of Socialism 
... In [the current] situation tactics must prevail over 
strategy. 

Even Lenin, at various moments of his career, had 
engaged in tactical retreats. Poland, Jamzelski claimed, 
must do the same.^^^ Pavlov believed that Jamzelski 
intended to retreat much too far. The danger that he would 
do so was greatly increased by the Polish regime’s 
capitulation to Church pressure for a second visit by John 
Paul II in June. According to Pavlov: 



The episcopate, and right-wing forces within the 
PUWP and the country at large, seek to influence 
Jaruzelski and intimidate him with the might of the 
Church. There are many signs that the right wing and 
the Church are succeeding in this.^^^ 

Among other worrying signs of Jaruzelski ’s 
susceptibility to right-wing pressure was his willingness 
to allow family farms and the private ownership of land to 
be enshrined in the Polish constitution. The Soviet 
embassy condemned a report presented to the PUWP 
Politburo on February 1 on “The Causes and 
Consequences of Social Crises in the History of the Polish 
People’s Republic” as the product of “bourgeois 
methodology”: 

[The report] reduces the essence of the class struggle 
in the Polish People’s Republic to conflicts between 
the authorities and society, thereby deliberately 
excluding the possibility of analyzing the actions of 
anti- Socialist forces, and their connections with the 
West’s ideological sabotage centers. There is not a 
word about the USSR’s help in restoring and 
developing Poland’s economy. 

After extensive lobbying by the Soviet embassy, which 
had received an advance copy, the report was rejected and 
it was agreed that a revised version should be prepared. 



emphasizing Poland’s supposed achievements in Socialist 
construction under the leadership of the PUWP.^^^ 
Aristov continued, however, to complain that “ideological 
work remains a most neglected sector of the PUWP’s 
activity,” and that the PUWP leadership was failing to 
master “the revisionist right-wing opportunist bias in the 
Party.” The press was deeply tainted by revisionism and 
Eurocommunism, while Polish translations of Soviet 
textbooks were openly disparaged: 

Currency has been given to the idea that the Soviet 
model is unsuitable for Poland; the PUWP is 
incapable of solving contradictions in the interests of 
the whole of society, and a “third path” needs to be 
worked out. There is increasing criticism of real 
Socialism. 

As the time for John Paul IPs return to Poland 
approached, the official mood in both Warsaw and 
Moscow became increasingly nervous. On April 5, 1983 
Pavlov forwarded to Viktor Chebrikov, the KGB 
chairman, a request from Kiszczak for “material and 
technical assistance in connection with the Pope’s visit”: 
150 rifles of the kind used for firing rubber bullets, 20 
armed personnel carriers, 300 cars for transporting plain 
clothes personnel and surveillance equipment, 200 army 
tents and various medical supplies.^ According to 
Pavlov, Kiszczak was close to panic, declaring that he 



could no longer “rely on anyone.” SB sources in the 
Vatican reported that, though statements drafted for John 
Paul II were usually moderate, he tended to depart from 
prepared texts, improvise and get carried away. Kiszczak 
feared that he would do the same in Poland. 

The SB’s only ground for optimism was the decline in 
the Pope’s health since the assassination attempt in the 
previous year. “At the present time,” said Kiszczak, “we 
can only dream of the possibility that God will recall him 
to his bosom as soon as possible.” Kiszczak seized 
eagerly on any evidence which suggested that the Pope’s 
days were numbered. According to one improbable SB 
report, which he passed on to the KGB, John Paul II was 
suffering from leukemia but used cosmetics to conceal his 
condition. ^ ^ ^ Two years earlier the KGB had received an 
equally inaccurate report from the Hungarian AVH which 
claimed that the Pope was suffering from cancer of the 
spinal column. About a fortnight after Kiszczak’ s 
appeal for help from the KGB, Aristov reported further 
evidence that the Polish authorities were wilting under 
papal pressure. Having at first refused to allow large 
open-air masses at Krakow and Katowice, they had given 
way and agreed to both — thus running the unacceptable 
risk “of inflaming religious fanaticism among the working 
class. 

On the eve of the Pope’s arrival on June 16, 1983, the 
underground Warsaw weekly Tygodnik Mazowsze 



expressed the hope that his visit would “enable people to 
break through the barrier of despair, just as his 1979 visit 
broke through the barrier of fear.” In his first words after 
his emotional homecoming at Warsaw airport, John Paul 
II reached out to those imprisoned and persecuted by the 
regime: 

I ask those who suffer to be particularly close to me. 

I ask this in the words of Christ: “I was sick, and you 
visited me. I was in prison and you came to me.” I 
myself cannot visit all those in prison [gasps from 
the crowd], all those who are suffering. But I ask 
them to be close to me in spirit to help me, just as 
they always do.^^^ 

At every stage during the next nine days, as during John 
Paul IPs first visit four years earlier, the gulf between his 
immense moral authority and the discredited one-party 
state was plain for all to see. Even Jaruzelski sensed it 
during his first meeting with the Pope in the ornate 
surroundings of Belweder presidential palace. Though a 
nonbeliever, Jaruzelski later admitted that, “My legs were 
trembling and my knees were knocking together . . . The 
Pope, this figure in white, it all affected me emotionally. 
Beyond all reason . . 

For millions of Poles, the visit was equally 
unforgettable. Many walked across Poland to see John 
Paul II, often sleeping by the roadside during their 



journeys. Wherever the Pope stopped, there were rarely 
less than half a million people waiting for him.^^^ “We 
have to deal with the most famous Pole in the world,” 
grumbled Kiszczak, “and, unfortunately, we have to do it 
here in Poland!”^ Though the Pope could not meet the 
leaders of the illegal Solidarity underground during his 
visit, he had sent an emissary. Father Adam Boniecki, to 
see them before he arrived and convey his gratitude and 
admiration to them.^^^ At first the authorities refused to 
allow Walesa to meet the Pope; then, on the final day of 
his visit, they gave way and Walesa was flown to a 
meeting in the Tatra mountains. An underground cartoon 
of the time showed SB agents disguised as sheep and 
goats clutching boom microphones as they tried to listen 
in to the conversation. 

The formal ending of martial law a month after the 
Pope’s visit did little to mend the regime’s tattered 
reputation. Nor did Rakowski’s visit to address Gdansk 
shipyard workers on the third anniversary of the August 
1980 accords. Having arrived to proclaim Solidarity dead 
and Walesa a has-been, he found himself upstaged by 
Solidarity hecklers. Walesa, in an admittedly stumbling 
statement, had the workers on his side when he accused 
Rakowski and his colleagues of using the 1980 strikes to 
lever Gierek out of power and advance their own careers. 
It was probably this debacle at Gdansk which finally 
persuaded the regime to broadcast the libelous video of 



Walesa concocted by the SB at the end of the previous 
year. Film footage taken by a hidden SB camera of 
Walesa eating a birthday meal with his brother Stanislaw 
was used as the basis of a bogus “documentary” entitled 
Money, which purported to expose Walesa’s greed and 
corruption. The dialogue was constructed by splicing 
together some of Walesa’s public statements, misleading 
extracts from the stolen tape-recording of his birthday 
celebrations and words spoken by a Warsaw actor 
imitating Walesa’s voice. 

The Polish files seen by Mitrokhin end just too early to 
clarify who exactly was involved in the decision to go 
ahead with an active measure begun over a year earlier. 
Kiszczak later tried to put the blame on his SB 
subordinate, Adam Pietruszka, but he must certainly have 
been among those who authorized the use of the video. 
The film dialogue included a fabricated exchange about 
Walesa’s supposed fortune in the West: 

LECH WALESA: You know all in all it is over a 
million dollars . . . Somebody has to draw it all and 
put it somewhere. It can’t be brought into the 
country, though. 

STANISLAW WALESA: No, no, no! 

LECH WALESA: So I thought about it and they 
came here and this priest had an idea that they would 
open an account in that bank, the papal one. They 
give 1 5 percent there . . . Somebody has to arrange it 



all, open accounts in the Vatican. I can’t touch it 
though or I’d get smashed in the mug. So you could . 


Part of the purpose of the SB active measure was to 
sabotage Walesa’s prospect of winning the Nobel Peace 
Prize. The actor impersonating Walesa explains that the 
prize is worth a lot of money, then complains, ‘T’d get it if 
it weren’t for the Church! But the Church is starting to 
interfere.” “Yeah,” says his brother, “because they’ve put 
up the Pope again.”^^^ 

On October 5, however, came the news that Walesa 
had indeed been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. To 
counter the SB’s attempt to portray him as a corrupt 
fortunehunter, Walesa announced that he was giving his 
prize money to a Church scheme to help private farmers 
modernize and mechanize the countryside. Though 
now terminally ill, Andropov could barely contain his 
fiiry. From his sickbed he despatched a furious letter to 
Jaruzelski: 

The Church is reawakening the cult of Walesa, 
giving him inspiration and encouraging him in his 
actions. This means that the Church is creating a new 
kind of confrontation with the Party. In this situation, 
the most important thing is not to make concessions . 



Jamzelski appeared unmoved. A month later he wrote a 
remarkable letter to John Paul II saying that he still often 
thought of their conversations during his visit to Poland 
because, “regardless of understandable differences in 
assessment, they were full of heartfelt concern for the fate 
of our motherland and the well-being of man.”^^^ 

In April 1984, two months after Andropov’s death, 
Jamzelski was summoned to explain himself at another 
secret meeting in a railway coach at the border city of 
Brest-Litovsk, this time with foreign minister Gromyko 
and defense minister Ustinov. Gromyko gave a grim 
account of the meeting to the Politburo on April 26: 

Concerning the attitude of the Polish Church, 
[Jamzelski] described the Church as an ally, without 
whom progress is impossible. He did not say a word 
about a determined stmggle against the intrigues of 
the Church. 

Andropov’s successor, Konstantin Chernenko, declared 
that the Church was leading a counter-revolutionary 
offensive in Poland, “inspiring and uniting the enemies of 
Communism and those dissatisfied by the present 
system.” The comments of Mikhail Gorbachev, who was 
to succeed Chernenko eleven months later, were curiously 
prophetic. “It seems to me,” he said, “that we don’t yet 
understand the tme intentions of Jamzelski. Perhaps he 
wishes to have a pluralistic system of government in 



Poland.”^^^ 

As in Czechoslovakia during and after the Prague 
Spring, every stage of the Polish crisis was monitored by 
illegals on PROGRESS operations. In Poland, as in 
Czechoslovakia, there are indications that at least a few of 
the illegals became sympathetic to the reformers. The 
evidence is clearest in the case of Valentin Viktorovich 
Barannik (codenamed ORLOV) and his wife, Svetlana 
Mikhaylovna (codenamed ORLOVA), who, from 1978 
onwards, were sent on a series of assignments in Poland 
using false West German passports. In the summer of 
1982, ORLOV despatched to the center a devastating 
critique of the nature of the Polish one-party state: 

The absence of a legal opposition leads to the fact 
that only Yes men are successful. Views which are 
contrary to those of the leadership are not discussed, 
but suppressed and eliminated. 

The whole of the ruling stratum is engaged in a 
hidden struggle, individually and in groups, for an 
even higher post, a prestigious appointment and 
other advantages. Thus, the Party bureaucracy is not 
in a position to lead the country while taking a 
comprehensive account of all its problems and needs. 

Without creativity and free enterprise, a society is 
not viable, and it becomes the victim of 
bureaucracy. 



The files noted by Mitrokhin do not record the Centre’s 
doubtless outraged response. There is little doubt, 
however, that there were other illegals who agreed 
privately with what ORLOV dared to say openly. 

AS EARLY AS 1980 the Soviet Politburo had been 
forced into the reluctant recognition that the only effective 
defense against a Polish counter-revolution was the fear 
of Soviet military intervention. That fear, however, was a 
dwindling asset based on memories of Budapest in 1956, 
Prague in 1968 and Kabul in 1979. Once the Politburo 
secretly turned against the idea of invading Warsaw in 
1980, its policy was based on a bluff which could not be 
sustained indefinitely. 

Gorbachev’s rise to power in 1985 hastened the 
moment when the bluff would be called. In some of his 
first meetings as general secretary with east European 
leaders, he warned that they could no longer expect the 
Red Army to come to their rescue if they fell out with 
their fellow citizens. Gorbachev conveyed the same 
message more formally at a meeting of Comecon leaders 
in Moscow in November 1986.^^^ Though the east 
European regimes were, predictably, unwilling to share 
the secret with their subjects, it was only a matter of time 
before they discovered it. It did not occur to Gorbachev, 
however, that he might be opening the way to the end of 
the Communist era in eastern Europe. He expected the 
hardliners, when they could hold out no longer, to be 



succeeded by a generation of little Gorbachevs anxious to 
emulate the reforms being introduced in Moscow. Few 
peacetime miscalculations have had such momentous 
consequences. Once a new crisis arose within the Soviet 
Bloc and it became clear that the Red Army would stay in 
its barracks, the “Socialist Commonwealth” was doomed. 

The end game began in Poland. By the beginning of 
1989, with the economy in dire straits and the return of 
labor unrest, the Polish Politburo was discussing new 
austerity measures which threatened to produce an 
explosion of discontent reminiscent of that in 1980. 
Jaruzelski refused to consider a return to martial law, 
convinced that it would lead to much greater loss of life 
than in 1981. The only option, he believed, was to hold 
discussions with the still-illegal Solidarity in return for its 
help in preserving the peace. Though Jaruzelski had the 
support of Czeslaw Kiszczak, interior minister in charge 
of the SB and one of the leading hardliners of 1981, he 
was able to push his proposal through the Politburo only 
by threatening to resign. Two months of tortuous 
negotiations led to Solidarity’s relegalization and to 
general elections in June under rules which, though 
calculated to produce a large Communist majority, would 
give Solidarity a place in parliament. To the stupefaction 
of both itself and its opponents, however. Solidarity won 
a sweeping victory. A few months earlier the government 
spokesman, Jerzy Urban, had dismissed Solidarity as a 
“non-existent organization” and Walesa as a “private 



citizen” of no political significance. After the Communist 
defeat he told the outgoing government, “This is not just a 
lost election, gentlemen. It’s the end of an age.”^^^ 

The end came more quickly than anyone thought 
possible. Any remaining doubts about Moscow’s 
willingness to tolerate the removal of the Communist old 
guard disappeared during Gorbachev’s visit to East Berlin 
in September to attend the fortieth birthday celebrations 
of the now-doomed “German Democratic Republic.” He 
told Honecker in a phrase quickly made public by the 
Soviet delegation, “In politics life punishes severely those 
who fall behind.” Honecker himself fell from power six 
weeks later. Even when it became clear that the whole 
Communist order, and not merely the old guard, was at 
risk in eastern Europe, Gorbachev did not draw back. He 
sent his close adviser Aleksandr Yakovlev to the capitals 
of the disintegrating Socialist Commonwealth “to make 
the point over and over again: We are not going to 
interfere.” Yakovlev said later: 

Please, we told them, make your own calculations, 
but make sure you understand that our troops will 
not be used, even though they are there. They will 
remain in their barracks and will not go anywhere, 
under any circumstances. 

After delirious East German crowds surged through the 
Berlin Wall on November 9 it took only the last seven 



weeks of the year for the remaining one-party states to 
topple like a house of cards. 

The Centre accepted the collapse of the Soviet Bloc 
with far less equanimity than Gorbachev. Though the 
KGB devised active measures in a desperate attempt to 
stave off the downfall of the Communist regimes, it was 
refused permission to implement them. According to the 
head of the FCD, Leonid Shebarshin, the leaders of 
eastern Europe were told to fend for themselves. “But,” he 
complains, “they were educated only to be friends of the 
Soviet Union; they were never prepared to stand on their 
own feet. They were just thrown to the wolves. 



CONCLUSION: FROM THE ONE- 

PARTY STATE 

TO THE PUTIN PRESIDENCY 


The Role of Russian Intelligence 


Most academic historians have been slow to recognize the 
role of intelligence communities in the international 
relations and political history of the twentieth century. 
One striking example concerns the history of signals 
intelligence (SIGINT). From 1945 onwards, almost all 
histories of the Second World War mentioned the 
American success in breaking the main Japanese 
diplomatic cipher over a year before the attack on Pearl 
Harbor. British success in breaking German ciphers 
during the First World War was also common knowledge; 
indeed one well-publicized German decrypt produced by 
British codebreakers — the Zimmermann telegram — had 
hastened the US declaration of war on Germany in 1917. 
But, until the revelation of the ULTRA secret in 1973, it 



occurred to almost no historian (save for former 
intelligence officers who were forbidden to mention it) 
that there might have been major SIGINT successes 
against Germany as well as Japan. Even after the 
disclosure of ULTRA’S important role in British and 
American wartime operations in the west, it took another 
fifteen years before any historian raised the rather obvious 
question of whether there was a Russian ULTRA on the 
eastern front. ^ 

At the end of the twentieth century, many of the 
historians who now acknowledge the significance of 
SIGINT in the Second World War still ignore it 
completely in their studies of the Cold War. This sudden 
disappearance of SIGINT from the historical landscape 
immediately after VJ Day has produced a series of 
eccentric anomalies even in some of the leading studies of 
policymakers and international relations. Thus, for 
example. Sir Martin Gilbert’s massive and mostly 
authoritative multi-volume official biography of Churchill 
acknowledges his passion for SIGINT as war leader but 
includes not a single reference to his continuing interest in 
it as peacetime prime minister from 1951 to 1955. 

There is even less about SIGINT in biographies of 
Stalin. While there are some excellent histories of the 
Soviet Union, it is difficult to think of any which devotes 
as much as a sentence to the enormous volume of SIGINT 
generated by the KGB and GRU. In many studies of 
Soviet foreign policy, the KGB is barely mentioned. The 



bibliography of the most recent academic history of 
Russian foreign relations from 1917 to 1991 (published in 
1998), praised by a British authority on the subject as 
“easily the best general history of Soviet foreign policy,” 
contains — apart from a biography of Beria — not a single 
work on Soviet intelligence among more than 120 titles.^ 
Though such aberrations by leading historians are due 
partly to the over-classification of intelligence archives 
(worst in the case of SIGINT), they derive at root from 
what psychologists call “cognitive dissonance” — the 
difficulty ah of us have in grasping new concepts which 
disturb our existing view of the world. ^ For many 
twentieth-century historians, political scientists and 
international relations specialists, secret intelligence has 
been just such a concept. It is, of course, naive to assume, 
as some “spy writers” have done, that the most secret 
sources necessarily provide the most important 
information. But it is also naive to suppose that research 
on twentieth-century international relations and 
authoritarian regimes (to take only two examples) can 
afford to neglect the role of intelligence agencies. As a 
new century dawns the traditional academic disregard for 
intelligence is in serious, if not yet terminal, decline. A 
new generation of scholars has begun to emerge, less 
disoriented than most of their predecessors by the role of 
intelligence and its use (or abuse) by policymakers.^ A 
vast research agenda awaits them. 



Research on the Soviet era has already undermined the 
common assumption of a basic symmetry between the 
role of intelligence in East and West. The Cheka and its 
successors were central to the functioning of the Soviet 
system in ways that intelligence communities never were 
to the government of Western states. The great 
nineteenth-century dissident Aleksandr Herzen, perhaps 
the first real Russian socialist, said that what he feared for 
the twentieth century was “Genghis Khan with a 
telegraph” — a traditional despot with at his command all 
the power of the modem state. With Stalin’s Russia, 
Herzen’s nightmare became reality. But the power of the 
Stalinist state was, as George Orwell realized, in large 
part a secret power. The constmction and survival of the 
world’s first one-party state in Russia and its “near 
abroad” depended on the creation after the October 
Revolution of an unprecedented system of surveillance 
able to monitor and suppress all forms of dissent. In 
Nineteen Eighty-Four Orwell depicts a state built on 
almost total surveillance: 

There was ... no way of knowing whether you were 
being watched at any given moment. How often, or 
on what system, the Thought Police plugged in on 
any individual wire was guesswork. It was even 
conceivable that they watched everybody all the 
time. But at any rate they could plug in your wire 
whenever they wanted to.^ 



Millions in Stalin’s Russia felt almost as closely watched 
as Winston Smith in Nineteen Eighty-Four. “Because of 
the ubiquity of NKVD informers,” writes historian 
Geoffrey Hosking, many people had no one whom 
they trusted completely.”^ 

The foundations of Stalin’s surveillance state were laid 
by Lenin, the Cheka’s most ardent supporter within the 
Bolshevik leadership, who dismissed protests at its 
brutality as wimpish “wailing.” With Lenin’s personal 
encouragement, the Cheka gradually permeated every 
aspect of life under the Soviet regime.^ When, for 
example, Lenin sought to stamp out celebration of the 
Russian Christmas, it was to the Cheka that he turned. 
“All Chekists,” he instructed on December 25, 1919, 
“have to be on the alert to shoot anyone who doesn’t turn 
up to work because of ‘Nikola’ [St. Nicholas’s Day].”^ 
Stalin used the Cheka’s successors, the OGPU and the 
NKVD, to carry through the greatest peacetime 
persecution in European history, whose victims included a 
majority of the Party leadership, of the high command and 
even of the commissars of state security responsible for 
implementing the Great Terror. Among Western 
observers of the Terror, unable to comprehend that such 
persecution was possible in an apparently civilized 
society, there were some textbook cases of cognitive 
dissonance. The American ambassador, Joseph Davies, 
informed Washington that the show trials had provided 



“proof beyond reasonable doubt to justify the verdict of 
guilty of treason.” The historian Sir Bernard Pares, widely 
regarded as the leading British expert of his generation on 
all things Russian, wrote as late as 1962, “Nearly all 
[those condemned at the trials] admitted having conspired 
against the life of Stalin and others, and on this point it is 
not necessary to doubt them.”^ 

After the Second World War the NKVD and its 
successor, the MGB, played a central role in the creation 
of the new Soviet empire in eastern and central Europe. 
Their role, according to a sanctimonious Soviet official 
history, was to “help the people of liberated countries in 
establishing and strengthening a free domestic form of 
govemmenf’^^ — in other words, to construct a series of 
obedient one-party states along the Soviet Union’s 
western borders. Throughout the Soviet Bloc, security and 
intelligence services, newly created in the image of the 
MGB, played a crucial part in the establishment of 
Stalinist regimes. Informers in the German Democratic 
Republic were seven times more numerous even than in 
Nazi Germany. As in East Germany, many of the leaders 
of the new one-party states were not merely loyal 
Stalinists but also former Soviet agents. 

Though post- Stalinist enemies of the people were 
downgraded by the KGB to the category of dissidents and 
subjected to less homicidal methods of repression, the 
campaign against them remained uncompromising. In 
order to understand the workings of the Soviet state, much 



more detailed research is needed on the KGB’s methods 
of social control. Mitrokhin’s notes on documents from 
internal KGB directorates which found their way into 
FCD files illustrate the enormous wealth of highly 
classified material on the functioning of the Soviet system 
which still remains hidden in the archives of today’s 
Russian security service, the FSB. 

Among the KGB’s innovations during the Cold War 
was the punitive use of psychiatry against ideological 
subversion. The KGB recruited a series of psychiatrists at 
the Serbsky Institute for Forensic Psychiatry and other 
institutes who were instructed to diagnose political 
dissidents as cases of “paranoiac schizophrenia,” thus 
condemning them to indefinite incarceration in mental 
hospitals where they could be drugged and tranquilized. 
One “plan of agent operational measures” implemented 
late in 1975 involved the use of four agents 
(KRAYEVSKY, PETROV, PROFESSOR and VAYKIN) 
and six co-optees (BEA, LDR, MGV, MZN, NRA and 
SAB) in the psychiatric profession. There were, almost 
certainly, many more. Remarkably, most incarcerated 
dissidents retained their sanity, even after treatment by 
KGB psychiatrists. An examination of twenty-seven of 
them in 1977-8 by Aleksandr Aleksandrovich 
Voloshanovich, a doctor at the Dolgoprudnaya psychiatric 
hospital, concluded that none was suffering from any 
psychological disorder. In 1983 Soviet psychiatrists 
resigned from the World Psychiatric Association, just in 



time to avoid expulsion for systematic abuse of their 
patients. 

The KGB’s most widely used methods of social control 
were the simpler, though immensely labor-intensive, 
techniques of ubiquitous surveillance and intimidation. 
Andropov’s first-hand experience as ambassador in 
Budapest in 1956, reinforced by the Czechoslovak crisis 
during his first year as KGB chairman, convinced him 
that the KGB could not afford to overlook a single 
instance of ideological subversion. “Every such act,” he 
insisted, “represents a danger.”^ ^ None was too trivial to 
attract the attention of the KGB. The effort and resources 
employed to track down each and every author of an 
anonymous letter or seditious graffito criticizing the 
Soviet system frequently exceeded those devoted in the 
West to a major murder enquiry. 

Among the many successful operations against such 
authors which were celebrated in the classified in-house 
journal KGB Sbornik was the hunt for a subversive 
codenamed KHUDOZHNIK (“Artisf’), who in July 1971 
began sending anonymous letters attacking Marxism- 
Leninism and various Party functionaries to CPSU and 
Komsomol committees. The letters were written in 
ballpoint pen and signed “Central Committee of the 
Freedom Party.” Forensic examination revealed barely 
detectable traces on the back of some of the letters of 
pencil drawings — hence the codename KHUDOZHNIK 
and the hypothesis that he had studied at art school. 



Detailed study of the contents of the letters also revealed 
that he regularly read Komsomolskaya Pravda and 
listened to foreign radio stations. The fact that some of the 
letters were sent to military Komsomols led to an 
immense trawl through the records of people dismissed 
from military training establishments and the files of 
reserve officers. The search for KHUDOZHNIK was 
concentrated in Moscow, Yaroslavl, Rostov and Gavrilov- 
Yam, where his letters were posted. In all four places the 
postal censorship service (Sluzhba PK) searched for many 
months for handwriting similar to KHUDOZHNIK’ s; 
numerous KGB agents and co-optees were also shown 
samples of the writing and given KHUDOZHNIK’ s 
supposed psychological profile. An enormous research 
exercise was undertaken to identify and scrutinize official 
forms which KHUDOZHNIK might have filled in. 
Eventually, after a hunt lasting almost three years, his 
writing was found on an application to the Rostov City 
Housing Commission. In 1974 KHUDOZHNIK was 
unmasked as the chairman of a Rostov street committee 
named Korobov. After a brief period under surveillance, 
he was arrested, tried and imprisoned. As in many 
similar cases, the triumphalist KGB report on the lengthy 
operation to track down KHUDOZHNIK showed no 
sense of the absurdity of devoting such huge resources to 
the hunt for an author of “libels against Soviet reality” 
none of which ever became public. 

KGB officers were regularly reminded by articles in 



KGB Sbornik and other exhortations that even Western 
popular music was inherently subversive. Provincial 
KGBs went to enormous pains to discover the extent of 
local interest in such music, and were usually disturbed by 
what they discovered. The KGB in Dnepropetrovsk 
Oblast, where Brezhnev had begun his career as a party 
apparatchik, calculated after a presumably lengthy 
examination of young people’s private correspondence in 
the mid-1970s, that almost 80 percent of the 15-20-year- 
old age group “systematically listened to broadcasts from 
Western radio stations,” especially popular music, and 
showed other unhealthy signs of interest in Western pop 
stars such as trying to obtain their photographs. The 
almost surreal nature of the report on musical subversion 
in Dnepropetrovsk Oblast is a reminder of how the hunt 
for ideological dissidence frequently destroyed all sense 
of the absurd among those committed to the holy war 
against it: 

Even listening to musical programs gave young 
people a distorted idea of Soviet reality, and led to 
incidents of a treasonable nature. Infatuation with 
trendy Western popular music, musical groups and 
performers falling under their influence leads to the 
possibility of these young people embarking on a 
hostile path. Such infatuation has a negative 
influence on the interests of society, inflames vain 
ambitions and unjustified demands, and can 



encourage the emergence of informal [not officially 
approved] groups with a treasonable tendency. 

Michael Jackson and Pink Floyd, amongst others, were 
thus identified as potential threats to the Soviet system. 
The fact that the Communist one-party states felt so 
threatened by Western pop stars confirmed their status as 
symbols of youthful rebellion. Even in Albania, after the 
collapse in 1992 of the last and most isolated Communist 
regime in Europe (isolated even from Moscow), the 
elegant tree-lined Bulevard in the center of Tirana was 
full of young people wearing Michael Jackson (or “Miel 
Jaksen”) T-shirts. The decapitated statue of Stalin was 
inscribed, in large red characters, with the words “Pink 
Floyd.”i6 

All points of contact between Soviet citizens and 
Westerners were regarded by the Centre as potential 
causes of ideological contagion. Foreign residencies had 
Line SK officers whose chief duty was to prevent such 
contamination in the local Soviet colony, which 
invariably contained large numbers of KGB agents and 
co-optees. In the mid-1970s 15 percent of Soviet 
employees in New York were fiilly recruited agents. It 
has long been known that Soviet groups traveling abroad 
were always carefully shepherded by KGB officers. What 
has not usually been appreciated, however, is the large 
proportion of agents and co-optees in each group 
(frequently over 15 percent) who monitored the behavior 



of their fellow travelers. When the Soviet State Academic 
Symphony Orchestra gave concerts in the FRG, Italy and 
Austria in October and November 1974, for example, two 
KGB officers, Pavel Vasilyevich Sobolev and Pyotr 
Tmbagard, posed as members of the orchestra staff. The 
122 members of the orchestra also included no less than 
eight agents and eleven co-optees. In the course of the 
tour “compromising materials” were obtained on 
thirtyfive members of the orchestra, including evidence of 
“alcohol abuse,” “speculation” (probably mostly 
involving attempts to purchase Western consumer goods), 
and — in the case of the Jewish musicians — “friendly” 
correspondence with individuals in Israel. Further 
“compromising” information was obtained on the 
musicians’ families, such as the fact that the wife of one 
of the violinists (identified by name in Mitrokhin’s notes) 
exchanged birthday greetings with acquaintances in 
France. The Moscow Chamber Orchestra also traveled 
to the West in October 1974 under the supervision of 
Mikhail Aleksandrovich Sizov of the KGB. Of the thirty 
members of the orchestra, three were agents and five co- 
optees. The “compromising information” gathered by the 
eight informers on the other twenty-two which most 
concerned the KGB was evidence that some of them 
corresponded with foreign acquaintances.^^ 

It was chiefly because of the immense time and effort 
expended in the war on all fronts against ideological 
subversion that the KGB was many times larger than any 



Western intelligence or security service. One example of 
the overwhelming concentration by provincial KGBs on 
cases of ideological subversion is provided by the 
classified report for 1970 by the KGB directorate for 
Leningrad and Leningrad Oblast. Not a single case had 
been discovered of either espionage or terrorism. By 
contrast, 502 people were given “prophylactic briefings” 
(warnings) over their involvement in “politically harmful 
incidents”; forty-one were prosecuted for committing or 
attempting to commit state crimes (most almost certainly 
involving ideological subversion); thirty- four Soviet 
citizens were caught trying to cross the frontier. Extensive 
work was carried out in institutes of higher education “to 
prevent hostile incidents.” The postal censorship service 
intercepted about 25,000 documents with “ideologically 
harmful contents”; a further 19,000 documents were 
confiscated at the frontier. One hundred and nine 
individuals (as compared with ninety-nine in 1969) were 
identified as distributing subversive leaflets and sending 
anonymous letters; twenty-seven of the culprits were 
tracked down. The KGB’s huge agent network was 
reported to have grown by another 17.3 percent over the 
previous year. On the debit side the KGB surveillance 
service was reported to have crashed twenty- seven cars in 
the course of its operations. Oleg Kalugin, who became 
deputy head of the Leningrad KGB in 1980, privately 
dismissed its work as “an elaborately choreographed 
farce,” in which it tried desperately to discover enough 



ideological subversion to justify its existence.^ ^ 

As head of the KGB from 1967 to 1982, Andropov 
sought to keep ideological subversion at the forefront of 
the leadership’s preoccupations. Issues as trivial (by 
Western standards) as the activities of a small group of 
Jehovah’s Witnesses in the depths of Siberia or the 
unauthorized publication in Paris of a short story by a 
Soviet author were liable to reach not merely Andropov’s 
desk but also, on occasion, the Politburo. Though even the 
leading dissidents had little resonance with the rest of the 
Soviet population, at least until the Gorbachev era, they 
occupied many hours of Politburo discussions. Early in 
1977 a total of thirty-two active measures operations 
against Andrei Sakharov, denounced by Andropov as 
“Public Enemy Number One,” were either in progress or 
about to commence both within the Soviet Union and 
abroad.^^ 

No group of Soviet dissidents during the Cold War 
could long avoid being penetrated by one or more of the 
KGB’s several million agents and co-optees. Their 
capacity to make a public protest was limited to the ability 
to circulate secretly samizdat pamphlets or unfurl banners 
briefly in Red Square before they were tom down by plain 
clothes KGB men. Until the final years of the Soviet 
system, the dissidents were a tiny minority within the 
Soviet population with very little public support or 
sympathy. Therein lay much of their heroism, as they 
battled courageously against what must have seemed 



impossible odds. 

The KGB helped to make the notion of serious political 
change appear an impossible dream. It simply did not 
occur to the vast majority of the Russian people that there 
was any alternative to the Soviet system. Despite 
grumbles about the standard of living, their almost 
unquestioning acceptance of the status quo had a 
profound effect on attitudes in the West, and thus on 
Western foreign policy. During the Cold War, most 
Western observers reluctantly assumed that the Soviet 
system would continue indefinitely. Hence the general 
sense of shock as well as of surprise when the Communist 
order in eastern Europe crumbled so swiftly in the final 
months of 1989, followed two years later by the almost 
equally rapid disintegration of the Soviet one-party state. 
Henry Kissinger claimed in 1992, ‘T knew no one ... who 
had predicted the evolution in the Soviet Union.”^^ 

AS WELL AS underestimating the centrality of the 
KGB’s system of social control to the functioning of the 
Soviet system. Western observers have often 
underestimated the power and influence of its security and 
intelligence chiefs. Beria, who became head of the 
NKVD at the end of the Terror, emerged as the second 
most powerful man in the Soviet Union — “my Himmler,” 
as Stalin once described him. In 1945 he was put in 
charge of the construction of the first Soviet atomic bomb. 
After Stalin’s death in 1953, Beria became the first Soviet 



security chief to make a bid for supreme power. Fear of 
his ambitions, however, united the rest of the Soviet 
leadership against him and led to his execution at the end 
of the year. 

It was frequently assumed thereafter that no KGB chief 
would ever again be given the opportunity by the rest of 
the Soviet leadership to make a successful bid for power. 
That assumption proved correct in the case of Aleksandr 
Shelepin, the dynamic and relatively youthful chairman of 
the KGB from 1958 to 1961, who made little secret of his 
desire to become general secretary, but was effectively 
sidelined after Khrushchev’s overthrow by Brezhnev and 
the other leading plotters. 

Yuri Andropov played a much subtler game than Beria 
or Shelepin in planning his own rise to power during the 
1970s. As Brezhnev became progressively feebler, 
Andropov gradually established himself as heir apparent, 
succeeding him as general secretary in 1982. There is, 
however, not a single reference to Andropov either in the 
2,000 pages of Henry Kissinger’s memoirs of the period 
1969-77, or in Cyrus Vance’s memoirs on his term as 
secretary of state, in succession to Kissinger, from 1977 
to 1980.^^ Vladimir Kryuchkov was similarly underrated 
as KGB chairman a decade later. Most Western observers 
were taken by surprise when he emerged as the ringleader 
of the abortive coup of August 1991 which sought to 
topple Gorbachev and install a hardline regime. Like 
Beria, however, Kryuchkov overreached himself Though 



the KGB had hitherto been an indispensable bulwark of 
the Communist one-party state, Kryuchkov’s mistimed 
attempt to shore it up merely hastened its collapse.^^ 
Yevgeni Primakov, first head of the FCD’s successor, 
the SVR, also attracted surprisingly little attention from 
most Western commentators. A much-praised American 
study of Yeltsin’s Russia, published on the eve of 
Primakov’s appointment as prime minister in September 

1998, contained not a single reference to him.^^ By the 
spring of 1999, though disclaiming any ambition to 
succeed Yeltsin, Primakov topped opinion polls of 
potential candidates in the following year’s presidential 
elections. Having apparently concluded that Primakov 
had become too powerful, Yeltsin sacked him in May 

1999. 

THE CHEKA AND its successors were central to the 
conduct of Soviet foreign policy as well as to the running 
of the one-party state. Kim Philby proudly told a KGB 
lecture audience in 1980, “Our service operating abroad is 
the Soviet Union’s first line of defense.”^^ The failure by 
many Western historians to identify the KGB as a major 
arm of Soviet foreign policy is due partly to the fact that 
many Soviet policy aims did not fit Western concepts of 
international relations. Surveys of Stalin’s foreign policy 
invariably mention the negotiations on collective security 
against Nazi Germany, which were conducted by Litvinov 



and Soviet diplomats, but usually ignore entirely the less 
conventional operations against the White Guards in 
Paris, the plan to assassinate General Franco early in the 
Spanish Civil War, the liquidation of the leading 
Trotskyists in western Europe in the late 1930s and the 
plot to kill Tito in 1953 — all of which were entrusted to 
the foreign intelligence service.^^ Even after Stalin’s 
death, much of Soviet foreign policy was not cast in a 
Western mold. 

INO, the interwar foreign intelligence agency, made its 
initial reputation by defeating a series of counter- 
revolutionary conspiracies involving anti-Bolshevik 
emigres and imperialist intelligence agencies. Though the 
evidence now available indicates that none of these (in 
reality, rather trivial) conspiracies had the slightest 
prospect of success, they bulked large in the imagination 
of the Soviet leadership. Similarly, INO’s liquidation of 
leading White Guards and Trotskyists outside the Soviet 
Union was, from Stalin’s perspective, a major victory. At 
the outbreak of the Second World War, Stalin was more 
concerned by Trotsky than by Hitler. 

During the 1930s Soviet foreign intelligence collection, 
thanks chiefly to the Great Illegals, led the world. The 
recruitment of the Magnificent Five and other high-flying 
ideological agents opened up the prospect of penetrating 
the very heard of imperialist power in Western capitals. 
The large number of British and other diplomatic 
documents obtained by INO had an important — though 



still little researched — influence on the making of Soviet 
foreign policy. Throughout the Stalin era, the Soviet 
intelligence contest with both Britain, the chief pre-war 
target, and the United States, the Main Adversary of the 
Cold War, was remarkably one-sided. SIS had no 
Moscow station between the wars; the United States 
possessed no espionage agency at all until 1941. INO’s 
main pre-war defeats were selfinflicted: chief among them 
the massacre of many of its best officers who fell victim 
to the paranoia of the Great Terror. 

Soviet intelligence penetration of the West reached its 
apogee during the Second World War. Never before had 
any state learned so many of its allies’ secrets. At Tehran 
and Yalta Stalin was probably better informed on the 
cards in the hands of the other negotiators than any 
statesman at any previous conference. Stalin knew the 
contents of many highly classified British and American 
documents which Churchill and Roosevelt kept even from 
most of their cabinets. ULTRA, though revealed to only 
six British ministers, was known to Stalin. So was the 
MANHATTAN project, which was carefully concealed 
from Vice-President Harry Truman until he succeeded 
Roosevelt in April 1945. (Truman was then also informed 
of ULTRA for the first time.)^^ There is a peculiar irony 
about Truman’s decision at the Potsdam conference in 
July 1945 to reveal to Stalin that “we had a new weapon 
of unusual destructive power.”^^ Stalin seemed 
unimpressed by the news — as well he might, since he had 



known about plans to build the American atomic bomb 
for fifteen times as long as Truman. 

Stalin was also much better informed than most 
American and British policymakers about the first major 
American-British intelligence success against the Soviet 
Union during the Cold War, the VENONA decrypts, 
which revealed the codenames and clues to the identities 
of several hundred Soviet agents. Remarkably, Truman 
seems never to have been informed of VENONA at all. 
Nor, almost certainly, were more than a small minority of 
the Attlee cabinet in Britain. Because of internal rivalries 
within the US intelligence community, even the CIA was 
not told until late in 1952. The Centre, however, had 
learned of VENONA by early in 1947 from William 
Weisband, an agent in the US SIGINT agency, ASA. 
Thus, amazingly, Stalin discovered the greatest American 
intelligence secret of the early Cold War over five years 
before either the president or the CIA.^^ 

The Centre’s extraordinary successes in penetrating its 
allies during the Second World War, and the fact that 
some of its agents remained in place after victory, raised 
exaggerated expectations of what Soviet intelligence 
could achieve during the Cold War against the Main 
Adversary and its NATO allies. KGB post-war strategy 
was based on an attempt to recreate the pre-war era of 
Great Illegals, establish a large network of illegal 
residencies and recruit a new generation of high-flying 
ideological agents. Alongside the legal residencies in 



Washington, New York and San Francisco, the Centre 
planned as late as the early 1980s to set up six illegal 
residencies, each running agents at the heart of the 
Reagan administration. Its plans proved hopelessly 
optimistic.^^ 

Despite some striking tactical successes, the KGB’s 
post-war grand strategy for penetrating the corridors of 
power in its Main Adversary failed. At least until the early 
1960s, its chief source of intelligence on American 
foreign policy was probably the penetration of the US 
embassy in Moscow. By the beginning of the Cold War 
the previously seductive myth- image of Stalin’s Russia as 
the world’s first truly socialist worker-peasant state, 
which had inspired the Magnificent Five and their 
American counterparts, was fading fast. Most of the 
idealistic student revolutionaries of the late 1960s, unlike 
their pre-war predecessors, turned for inspiration not to 
the old Communist parties but to a new left which seemed 
deeply suspect to the increasingly geriatric leadership of 
Brezhnev’s Soviet Union. 

The marginalization of the post-war Communist Parties 
in the United States and Great Britain deprived Soviet 
intelligence of what had previously been a major source 
of recruits and talent- spotters. Its most fertile Western 
recruiting grounds in the immediate aftermath of the 
Second World War were France and Italy, the two west 
European countries with the most powerful Communist 
Parties, both of which took part in post-war coalition 



governments. The longest-serving and probably most 
productive French and Italian agents identified in the files 
noted by Mitrokhin, JOUR and DARIO, both entered 
their respective foreign ministries during these years. 

By the 1950s the KGB was probably obtaining more 
high-grade diplomatic and political intelligence from the 
main NATO members in continental Europe than from 
the United States and Britain. As well as generating large 
numbers of diplomatic documents, the penetration of the 
French, Italian and other Western foreign ministries and 
Moscow embassies provided crucial assistance to KGB 
codebreakers. For most, if not all, of the Cold War the 
total number of diplomatic decrypts which the Centre 
considered sufficiently significant to forward to the 
Central Committee probably never dropped below 
100,000 a year.^^ During the Cold War as a whole, as a 
result of the partition of Germany and the flow of 
refugees from East to West, the FRG was the major 
NATO member most vulnerable to agent penetration — 
though the KGB’s successes were exceeded by those of 
its East German ally. The success of the HVA agent, 
Ganter Guillaume, in becoming aide to the Chancellor of 
West Germany at a crucial moment in East- West 
relations, just as Willy Brandt was beginning his 
Ostpolitik, was one of the greatest intelligence coups of 
the Cold War. 

Though the Centre acquired a considerable volume of 
high-grade intelligence from NATO countries, it was 



never satisfied by what it achieved. In Europe, as in north 
America, it refused to abandon its early Cold War 
ambition to create a new generation of Great Illegals. 
During the 1970s it sought and obtained promises of 
assistance from Communist leaders around the world in 
finding further Richard Sorges. The files seen by 
Mitrokhin suggest, however, that few, if any Sorges were 
discovered. By the mid-1970s the brightest of the young 
Party members in the few west European countries where 
Communism remained a powerful force tended to be 
Eurocommunist heretics rather than blindly obedient pro- 
Soviet loyalists ready to sacrifice their lives in the service 
of the Fatherland of the Toilers. Even some Soviet illegals 
had difficulty in preserving their ideological commitment 
when confronted with the reality of life in the West. As 
the Cold War progressed, the KGB’s best agents 
increasingly became mercenary (like Aldrich Ames) 
rather than ideological (like Kim Philby). 

Residencies, however, remained under pressure from 
the Centre leadership, which had almost no first-hand 
experience of life in the West, to cultivate major political 
figures. Hence the hopelessly unrealistic KGB schemes, 
all doubtless approved by the political leadership, to 
recruit Harold Wilson, Willy Brandt, Oskar Lafontaine, 
Cyrus Vance, Zbigniew Brzezinski and other senior 
Western statesmen. Kryuchkov responded to these and 
other failures not with a more realistic recruitment policy 
but with greater bureaucracy, demanding ever longer 



reports and more form-filling. Residents must have 
groaned inwardly in April 1985 when they received from 
the Centre a newly devised questionnaire which 
Kryuchkov instructed them to use as the basis for reports 
on politicians and other “prominent figures in the West” 
being considered as possible “targets for cultivation.” It 
contained fifty- six questions, many of them highly 
complex and minutely detailed. Question 14 in section 4 
of the questionnaire, for example, demanded information 
on: 


Life style: hobbies, enjoyments, tastes; books — ^what 
writers does he prefer; theater, music, painting, and 
what he particularly likes; collecting; attitude to sport 
(riding, hunting, fishing, swimming, chess, football, 
games, motoring, sailing, etc.), prizes won; hiking; 
with what kind of environment and what kind of 
people does he prefer to associate; what kind of 
cuisine does he prefer, and so on. 

The fifty-five other questions contained similarly detailed 
demands for reports on topics as diverse as 
“compromising information on subjecf’ and “subject’s 
attitude towards American foreign policy.”^^ A full 
answer to the questionnaire on any “prominent figure in 
the Wesf’ would have required months of investigations 
by residency operations officers. 



THE CENTRE’S MAIN weakness in the field of political 
intelligence was not, as it supposed, in intelligence 
collection but rather in its ability to interpret what it 
collected. Under both Stalin and Khrushchev, the Centre 
forwarded each day to the Kremlin a selection of foreign 
intelligence reports received from residencies and other 
sources, but usually shrank from offering more than 
perfunctory interpretation of the reports for fear of 
contradicting the views of the political leadership. Both 
Stalin and Khrushchev acted as their own, ill-qualified 
chief intelligence analysts. Brezhnev, by contrast, spent 
little time interpreting intelligence or any other 
information, thus giving Andropov greater scope than any 
of his predecessors to submit intelligence assessments. 

Intelligence assessment was worst in the Stalin era. 
Stalin himself bears a large measure of personal 
responsibility for the failure to heed repeated intelligence 
warnings of the 1941 German invasion. The 
institutionalized paranoia of the Stalinist system led to a 
series of other failures of assessment — among them the 
deluded belief in the middle of the war that the 
Magnificent Five, some of the Centre’s most gifted and 
productive agents, were part of an elaborate British 
deception. Though intelligence analysis after Stalin’s 
death never again descended to quite such paranoid 
depths, at moments of crisis in the Cold War the KGB 
tended to substitute conspiracy theory for balanced 
assessment. Within a year of becoming KGB chairman. 



Andropov was submitting distorted intelligence 
assessments to the Politburo designed to strengthen its 
resolve to crush the Prague Spring by armed force. His 
obsession with Western attempts to promote ideological 
sabotage in the Soviet Bloc made him unwilling to 
consider any evidence which suggested otherwise. In 
1968 the Centre destroyed classified US documents 
obtained by the Washington residency which showed that 
neither the CIA nor any other American agency was 
manipulating the reformers of the Prague Spring. 

In both the early 1960s and the early 1980s the Centre 
believed that the United States was planning a nuclear 
first strike against the Soviet Union. Though some FCD 
officers in Western residencies, far better acquainted with 
the West than Soviet leaders and KGB chairmen, 
privately dismissed such fears as absurd alarmism, they 
did not dare dispute the Centre’s judgment openly. The 
East German foreign intelligence chief, Markus Wolf, 
who resented the waste of time caused by KGB demands 
for HVA assistance in discovering non-existent plans for 
an American first strike, also knew better than to 
complain to Moscow. “These orders,” he claims, “were 
no more open to discussion than other orders from 
above. 

The distortion of Soviet intelligence analysis derived, at 
root, from the nature of the one-party state and its inherent 
distrust of all opposing views. The Soviet Union thus 
found it more difficult than its Western rivals to 



understand, and therefore to use, the political intelligence 
it collected. Though the Soviet leadership never really 
understood the West until the closing years of the Cold 
War, it would have been outraged to have its 
misunderstandings challenged by intelligence reports. 
Heterodox opinions within the Soviet system always ran 
the risk of being condemned as subversive. Those 
intelligence officers who dared to express them openly 
during the late 1930s were likely to have their life 
expectancy dramatically reduced. Even during the post- 
Stalin era, when their survival was no longer threatened, 
their careers, like that of Mitrokhin, were almost certain to 
suffer. Closed or semi-closed societies have an inbuilt 
advantage over open societies in intelligence collection 
from human sources, because Western capitals invariably 
have much lower levels of security and surveillance than 
their counterparts in Communist and other authoritarian 
regimes. Equally, however, one-party states have an 
inherent disadvantage when it comes to intelligence 
analysis, since analysts usually fear to tell the Party 
hierarch what it does not want to hear. 

Though careful to avoid offending the sensibilities of 
the political leadership, INO report-writers during the 
1930s knew that they were on safe ground if they 
produced evidence of British anti-Soviet conspiracies. 
During the Cold War, their FCD successors similarly 
knew that they were taking no risks if they used the 
United States as a scapegoat. One Line PR officer. 



interviewed a few weeks after the abortive 1991 coup, 
told Izvestia that he and his colleagues had spent much of 
their careers acting on the principle “Blame everything on 
the Americans, and everything will be OK.”^^ The 
intelligence reports received by the Soviet leadership thus 
tended to reinforce, rather than to correct, their 
misconceptions of the outside world. 

There is no more convincing evidence of Gorbachev’s 
“new thinking” towards the West during his first year as 
general secretary than his denunciation of the traditional 
bias of the FCD’s political reporting. The fact that the 
Centre had to issue stem instmctions at the end of 1985 
“on the impermissibility of distortions of the factual state 
of affairs in messages and informational reports sent to 
the Central Committee of the CPSU and other mling 
bodies” is a damning indictment of the KGB’s 
subservience to the standards of political correctness 
expected by previous Soviet leaders. 

For all their distortions, however, intelligence reports 
are sometimes cmcial to an understanding of Soviet 
foreign policy. Khmshchev’s policy towards the United 
States, in particular the horrendously dangerous gamble of 
the Cuban missile bases, was heavily influenced by 
erroneous reports of American preparations for a nuclear 
first strike. The growing authority of Andropov in the 
1970s and his policymaking troika with Gromyko and 
Ustinov is evidence of the influence of the Centre’s 
intelligence assessments during the Brezhnev era. The 



increasingly apocalyptic language used by Andropov as 
Brezhnev’s successor, culminating in denunciations of the 
“outrageous militarist psychosis” allegedly imposed on 
the American people by the Reagan administration, 
reflected, as in the early 1960s, alarmist Centre 
assessments of the (non-existent) threat of an American 
first strike. 

Despite Gorbachev’s early denunciation of KGB 
assessments, he came to rely on foreign intelligence in 
reorienting Soviet foreign policy to the United States. 
Hence his unprecedented decision to take the head of the 
FCD with him on his first visit to Washington in 1987 and 
his disastrous subsequent appointment of Kryuchkov as 
chairman of the KGB. Kryuchkov’s successor as head of 
the FCD, Shebarshin, insists that foreign intelligence 
reports were by now free from past, politically correct 
distortions. As the Soviet system began to crumble in 
1990-91, however, some of the old, anti-American 
conspiracy theories began to resurface. The United States 
and its allies were variously accused by Kryuchkov and 
other senior KGB officers of infecting Soviet grain 
imports, seeking to undermine the rouble, plotting the 
disintegration of the Soviet Union and training agents to 
sabotage the economy, administration and scientific 
research.^ ^ 

THE SOVIET SYSTEM found it far easier to digest 
scientific and technological than political intelligence. 



While Western politics were inherently subversive of the 
one-party state, most Western science was not. “The 
achievements of foreign technology” had first been 
identified as a Soviet intelligence target by Dzerzhinsky 
in 1925.^^ By the Second World War S&T, particularly in 
the military sphere, was seen as crucially important. 
Nothing did more than intelligence on British American 
plans to build the first atomic bomb to bring home to 
Stalin and the Centre the necessity of S&T in ensuring 
that Soviet military technology did not fall behind the 
West. As in the case of nuclear weapons, the early 
development of Soviet radar, rocketry and jet propulsion 
was heavily dependent on the imitation of Western 
technology. Stalin, indeed, had greater confidence in 
Western scientists than in his own. He did not trust Soviet 
technological innovation unless and until it was 
confirmed by Western experience.^^ 

The enormous flow of Western (especially American) 
S&T throughout the Cold War helps to explain one of the 
central paradoxes of a Soviet state which was famously 
described as “Upper Volta with missiles”: its ability to 
remain a military superpower while its infant mortality 
and other indices of social deprivation were at Third 
World levels. The fact that the gap between Soviet 
weapons systems and those of the West was far smaller 
than in any other area of economic production was due 
not merely to their enormous priority within the Soviet 
system but also to the remarkable success of S&T 



collection in the West. For most of the Cold War, 
American business proved much easier to penetrate than 
the federal government. Long before the KGB finally 
acquired a major spy in the CIA with the walk in of 
Aldrich Ames in 1985, it was running a series of other 
mercenary agents in American defense contractors. Soviet 
agent penetration was accompanied by interception of the 
fax communications of some of the United States’ largest 
companies.^^ During the early 1980s probably 70 percent 
of all current Warsaw Pact weapons systems were based 
on Western technology. To an astonishing degree, both 
sides in the Cold War depended on American know-how. 

Andropov and, at least initially, Gorbachev, saw greater 
use of S&T in nonmilitary spheres as one of the keys to 
the rejuvenation of the Soviet economy as a whole. The 
real economic benefit of Western scientific and 
technological secrets, though put by Directorate T at 
billions of dollars, was, however, severely limited by the 
structural failings of the command economy. The 
ideological blinkers of the Soviet system were matched by 
its economic rigidity and resistance to innovation by 
comparison with the market economies of the West. 
Hence the great economic paradox of the 1980s: that 
despite possessing large numbers of well-qualified 
scientists and engineers and a huge volume of S&T, 
Soviet technology fell steadily further behind its Western 
rivals. Before Gorbachev’s rise to power, the extent of 
that decline was concealed from the Soviet leadership. 



Politically correct FCD reports dwelt overwhelmingly on 
the economic problems of the capitalist West rather than 
on those of the “Socialist” East. In a biennial report on 
foreign intelligence operations completed in February 
1984, Kryuchkov emphasized “the deepening economic 
and social crisis in the capitalist world,” but made no 
mention of the far more serious crisis in the Soviet Bloc.^^ 
Even Gorbachev, in his speech to the Twenty- Seventh 
Party Congress in 1986 calling for “new thinking” in 
Soviet foreign policy, claimed that the crisis of capitalism 
was continuing to worsen.^^ 

Until the closing years of the Cold War, there was an 
extraordinary contrast between the Kremlin’s privileged 
access to the secrets of state-of-the-art Western 
technology and its failure to grasp the nature and extent of 
its own economic mismanagement. Gorbachev was the 
first post-war Soviet leader who gained access to 
moderately accurate statistics on the performance of the 
Soviet economy. Abel Aganbegyan, his most influential 
economic adviser in the early years of perestroika, 
calculated that between 1981 and 1985 there had been “a 
zero growth rate.” The revelation of the extent of Soviet 
economic stagnation and long-term decline relative to the 
West had a much more profound effect on Gorbachev’s 
policy than the successes of S&T collection against 
Western targets which had previously so impressed him. 
By the end of the decade, he had moved from trying to 
rejuvenate the command economy to accepting the market 



as the main economic regulator.^^ 

The conclusion of the Cold War, so far from ending 
Russian S&T operations in the West, created new Line X 
opportunities through the expansion of East- West 
scientific exchanges and business joint ventures, which 
the SVR was eager to exploit. The reactivation in the 
early 1990s of the leading British Line X agent Michael 
Smith was one sign among many of the continued priority 
given to S&T collection in the Yeltsin era.^^ For the SVR, 
as for the FCD, the main Line X target remained the 
United States. The relaxation of US security checks, in an 
attempt to build bridges to Moscow and Beijing, led in 
1994 to a dramatic increase in the number of Russian and 
Chinese scientists allowed to visit the Los Alamos and 
Sandia nuclear laboratories, as well as other institutes 
conducting classified research. Line X, however, has 
found less enthusiasm for its product than during the Cold 
War. The collapse of the Russian command economy left 
the military-industrial complex — ^previously the chief 
customer for S&T — in disarray. During (and perhaps even 
before) the Yeltsin presidency, Russian S&T operations 
seem to have been upstaged by those of the Chinese. A 
congressional enquiry concluded in 1999 that, over the 
two previous decades, China had obtained detailed 
intelligence on every warhead in the US nuclear arsenal. 
There is little doubt that the phenomenal achievements of 
Chinese S&T collection were inspired, at least in part, by 



the Soviet Union’s earlier success in copying the first 
American atomic bomb and in basing the majority of its 
Cold War weapons systems on Western technology. 

IT IS IMPORTANT not to judge the success of KGB 
foreign operations by purely Western standards. The 
Centre had, ultimately, an even higher priority than 
intelligence collection in the West. The Cheka had been 
founded six weeks after the Bolshevik seizure of power 
“for a revolutionary settlement of accounts with counter- 
revolutionaries.” In that primary role — to defend the 
Bolshevik one-party state against dissent in all its forms — 
the Cheka and its successors were strikingly successful. 

From the 1920s onwards the war against “counter- 
revolution” was waged abroad as well as at home. The 
FCD’s role in combating ideological subversion has given 
rise, in Yeltsin’s Russia, to a curious official amnesia. 
Like Kryuchkov and some other former senior FCD 
officers, the SVR maintains that the FCD was not 
involved in the persecution of dissidents and the abuse of 
human rights. In reality, it was centrally involved. Within 
the Soviet Bloc the war against ideological subversion 
was increasingly coordinated between the internal KGB 
and its foreign intelligence arm. 

In the immediate aftermath of the suppression of the 
Hungarian Uprising by Soviet tanks in 1956, and again 
after the destruction of the Prague Spring in 1968, many 
Western observers doubted whether the genie of freedom 



could be quickly returned to its bottle. In fact, thanks 
largely to the KGB and its Hungarian and Czechoslovak 
allies, one-party states were restored in both Budapest and 
Prague with remarkable speed and success. From 1968 
onwards the state of public opinion in the Soviet Bloc was 
carefully monitored by experienced illegals posing as 
Western tourists and business people, who sought out, and 
pretended to sympathize with, critics of the Communist 
regimes. In reporting on the results of these “PROGRESS 
operations,” the FCD was franker than it would have 
dared to be in analyzing, for example, satirical comments 
by Soviet citizens on Brezhnev’s increasing physical 
decrepitude. 

Throughout the Cold War the KGB’s war against 
ideological subversion was energetically waged in foreign 
capitals as well as on Soviet soil. Residencies in the West 
had standing instructions to collect as much material as 
possible to assist the persecution of dissidents, both at 
home and abroad: 

In order to take active measures against the 
dissidents, it is important to know of disagreements 
among them, differences of views and conflicts 
within the dissident milieu, reasons why they have 
arisen, and possible ways of exacerbating them; and 
particulars discrediting the dissidents personally 
(alcoholism, immoral behavior, professional decline 
and so forth, as well as indications of links with the 



CIA, Western special [intelligence] services and 
ideological centers). 

Residencies were also required to target many of the 
dissidents’ main supporters in the West. Among the 
KGB’s targets in Britain was the London neurologist 
Harold Merskey, who had campaigned on behalf of the 
victims of Soviet psychiatric abuse. On September 20, 
1976 the London residency posted a letter to Merskey, 
purporting to come from an anonymous wellwisher, 
warning him of an imminent attempt by unidentified 
assailants to cause him grievous bodily harm. Merskey, it 
was hoped, would become preoccupied with his own 
personal safety and spend less time supporting the 
incarcerated dissidents. 

So, far from being a mere adjunct to more conventional 
foreign intelligence operations, the LCD’s war against the 
dissidents was one of its chief priorities. Among its most 
important operations in 1978, for example, was the 
attempt to ensure that the dissident Yuri Orlov did not 
receive the Nobel Peace Prize — as Sakharov had done 
three years earlier. The fact that the prize went instead to 
Anwar Sadat and Menachem Begin was claimed by the 
Centre as a major triumph — though, in reality, it probably 
owed little to KGB active measures. Suslov, the 
Politburo’s leading guardian of ideological orthodoxy, 
was woken in the middle of the night by a phone call from 
the Oslo resident to be told the good news.^^ There are 



few better indications of the importance attached to a 
piece of information in any political system than the 
decision to wake a minister. 

Residencies also followed with anxious attention the 
emergence in some leading Western Communist parties 
of the Eurocommunist heresy which challenged the 
traditional infallibility of the Moscow line, and thus 
qualified as a novel form of ideological subversion. 
Among the more unusual active measures devised in the 
later 1970s were those designed to discredit 
Eurocommunist party leaders.^^ 

One of the FCD’s chief priorities until the closing years 
of the Cold War was to seek to prevent all Soviet 
dissidents and defectors achieving foreign recognition — 
even in fields entirely divorced from politics (at least as 
understood in the West). Enormous time and effort was 
devoted by the Centre to devising ways to damage the 
careers of Rudolf Nureyev, Natalia Makarova and other 
defectors from Soviet ballet. By the time the great 
cellist Mstislav Rostropovich (codenamed VOYAZHER, 
“Traveller”) left for the West in 1974, the KGB had 
ceased to plan operations to cause physical injury to 
emigres in the performing arts, but seems to have 
redoubled active measure campaigns intended to give 
them bad reviews in the Western media. In 1976, after 
Rostropovich and his wife, the singer Galina 
Vishnevskaya, were deprived of Soviet citizenship, the 
Centre appealed to all Soviet Bloc intelligence services 



for help in finding agents to penetrate their entourage. It 
was outraged by Rostropovich’s appointment in 1977 as 
director of the National Symphony Orchestra in 
Washington — a post he was to retain until his return to 
Russia seventeen years later — ^but encouraged by an 
untypically critical review of his work with the orchestra 
in the Washington Post in May 1978. The Centre 
circulated the review to Western residencies as an 
example of the kind of criticism they were to encourage, 
and demanded that they inspire articles attacking 
Rostropovich’s alleged vanity, failure to live up to 
Western expectations, and — especially ironic in view of 
KGB active measures against him — his supposed attempts 
to manipulate the Western media. 

Dissident chess players were also the targets of major 
KGB operations designed to prevent them winning 
matches against the ideologically orthodox. During the 
1978 world chess championship in the Philippines 
between the Soviet world champion, Anatoli Karpov, and 
the defector Viktor Korchnoi, the Centre assembled a 
team of eighteen FCD operations officers to try to ensure 
Korchnoi’s defeat.^^ KGB active measures may well have 
determined the outcome of a close and controversial 
championship. After draws in the first seven matches, 
during which Korchnoi had the better of the play, Karpov 
refused to shake hands with his opponent at the start of 
the eighth. A furious Korchnoi, who was known to play 
poorly when angry, lost the game. After twelve games the 



scores were level, with Korchnoi once again appearing in 
better form. During the next five games, however, 
Korchnoi was thrown off his stride by the presence in the 
front of the audience of a Russian hypnotist. Dr. Vladimir 
Zukhar, who stared intently at him throughout the play. 
After seventeen games, Korchnoi was three points down. 
By the end of the match, he had pulled back two of his 
defeats but lost the championship by a single point.^^ A 
book remains to be written about the KGB’s involvement 
in Soviet chess. 

POTENTIALLY THE MOST troublesome “ideological 
subversion” with which the KGB had to contend during 
the Cold War came from organized religion — especially 
Christianity, which failed to wither away as the 
Bolsheviks had hoped and expected. Though no other 
political party was allowed to exist within the Communist 
one-party state, Soviet rulers felt bound to proclaim a 
hypocritical respect for freedom of religion. By the end of 
the Second World War the attempt to eradicate religious 
practice had given way to subtler forms of persecution 
designed to ensure its steady decline and to discriminate 
against the faithful. Within the Russian Orthodox church 
the KGB was able to rely on an obedient hierarchy 
permeated by its agents. The Centre’s main problems 
came from other Christian churches and a courageous 
minority of Orthodox priests who demanded an end to 
religious persecution. For freedom of religion to make 



progress within the Soviet Union, however, persecuted 
Christians required strong support from the worldwide 
church — in particular from the World Council of 
Churches. They did not receive it. KGB agents in the 
WCC were remarkably successful in persuading it to 
concentrate on the sins of the imperialist West rather than 
religious persecution in the Soviet Bloc. In 1975 agent 
ADAMANT (Metropolitan Nikodim) was elected as one 
of the WCC’s six presidents. 

The importance attached by the KGB to controlling 
religious dissent and denying persecuted Soviet Christians 
support from the West was fiilly justified by events in 
Poland, where SB penetration never succeeded in 
bringing the Catholic Church under political control. By 
the early 1970s the KGB had already identified Karol 
Wojtyla, Archbishop of Krakow, as a potentially 
dangerous opponent, unwilling to compromise on either 
religious freedom or human rights. Though the SB wanted 
to arrest him, it dared not risk the outcry which would 
result in both Poland and the West. Wojtyla’ s election as 
Pope John Paul II in 1978 dealt the Polish Communist 
regime, and ultimately the cohesion of the Soviet Bloc, a 
blow from which they never recovered. During his 
triumphant tour of Poland in 1979, the contrast between 
the discredited Communist regime and the immense 
moral authority of the first Polish Pope was plain for all to 
see.^^ 

The new freedoms of the Gorbachev era similarly went 



far to justifying the KGB’s earlier fears of the potential 
damage to the Soviet regime if political dissidents were 
allowed to proceed with their “ideological subversion.” In 
1989, less than three years after Sakharov was freed from 
internal exile and allowed to return to Moscow, he 
established himself, as — in Gorbachev’s words 
— “unquestionably the outstanding personality” in the 
Congress of People’s Deputies. Almost all the main 
dissident demands of the early 1970s were now firmly 
placed on the political agenda. 

Only when the vast apparatus of KGB social control 
began to be dismantled did the full extent of its 
importance to the survival of the Soviet Union become 
clear. The manifesto of the leaders of the August 1991 
coup, led by Kryuchkov, which attempted to overthrow 
Gorbachev, implicitly acknowledged that the relaxation of 
the KGB campaign against ideological subversion had 
shaken the foundations of the one-party state: 

Authority at all levels has lost the confidence of the 
population ... Malicious mockery of all the 
institutions of state is being implanted. The country 
has in effect become ungovernable.^^ 

What the plotters failed to realize was that it was too late 
to turn back the clock. “If the coup d 'etat had happened a 
year and a half or two years earlier,” wrote Gorbachev 
afterwards, “it might, presumably, have succeeded. But 



now society was completely changed. Crucial to the 
change of mood was declining respect for the intimidatory 
power of the KGB, which had hitherto been able to 
strangle any Moscow demonstration at birth. Large 
crowds, which a few years earlier could never have 
assembled, gathered outside Yeltsin’s headquarters in the 
Moscow White House to protect it from attack, and later 
circled the Lubyanka, cheering enthusiastically as the 
giant statue of Feliks Dzerzhinsky was toppled from its 
plinth. 

At the time the speed of the collapse of the Soviet 
system took almost all observers by surprise. What now 
seems most remarkable, however, is less the sudden death 
of the Communist regime at the end of 1991 than its 
survival for almost seventy-five years. Without the system 
of surveillance and repression pioneered by Lenin and 
Dzerzhinsky, without the KGB’s immense Cold War 
campaign against ideological subversion, the Communist 
era would have been much briefer. The KGB had indeed 
proved to be “the sword and the shield” of the Soviet 
system. Its most enduring achievement was to sustain the 
longest-lasting one-party state of the twentieth century. 

WITH THE DISINTEGRATION of the one-party state 
went most of the KGB’s vast system of social control. But 
though the power of the internal KGB directorates 
(reorganized successively as a security ministry, a 
counter-intelligence service and a security service) 



dramatically declined, the influence of the newly 
independent successor to the FCD, the Sluzhba Vneshnei 
Razvedki, quickly recovered. Indeed, the SVR soon 
became more publicly assertive than the FCD had ever 
been. In 1993, its head, Yevgeni Primakov, published a 
report attacking NATO expansion as a threat to Russian 
security — and he did so at a time when the Russian 
foreign ministry was taking a much softer and more 
conciliatory line. On the eve of President Yeltsin’s visit to 
Washington in September 1994, Primakov once again 
upstaged the foreign ministry by publishing a warning to 
the West not to oppose the economic and political 
reintegration of Russia with other states which had 
formerly been part of the Soviet Union. Primakov’s 
deputy, Vyacheslav Trubnikov, asserted the SVR’s right 
to a public voice, even if it disagreed with the foreign 
ministry’s: “... We want to be heard ... We express our 
point of view as we deem necessary. 

The rivalry between SVR and foreign ministry during 
Yeltsin’s first five years as president ended in decisive 
victory for the SVR with Primakov’s appointment as 
foreign minister to replace the pro- Western Andrei 
Kozyrev in December 1996. Probably to the dismay of 
many Russian diplomats, Primakov took with him to the 
foreign ministry a number of SVR officers. Both as 
foreign minister and later as prime minister, Primakov 
remained in close touch with his former deputy, 
Trubnikov, who succeeded him as head of the SVR.^^ 



The SVR is also more assertive behind the scenes than 
the FCD dared to be. The FCD regularly swore slavish 
obedience to the Party leadership — as, for example, in the 
typically ponderous preamble to its “work plan” for 1984: 

The work of residencies abroad must be planned and 
organized in 1984 in strict accord with the decisions 
of the Twenty-sixth Party Congress, the November 
(1982) and June (1983) plenary sessions of the 
CPSU Central Committee, and the program 
directives and fundamental conclusions contained in 
the speeches of the Secretary General of the CPSU 
Central Committee, Comrade Yu. V. Andropov, as 
well as the requirements of the May (1981) All- 
Union Conference of the leadership of the [FCD].^^ 

Today’s SVR has abandoned such bureaucratic 
sycophancy. It reports direct to the president and sends 
him daily digests of foreign intelligence somewhat akin to 
the President's Daily Brief produced by the CIA in the 
United States. Unlike the CIA, however, the SVR lists 
policy options and does not hesitate to recommend those 
which it prefers.^^ 

How many SVR reports the ailing Yeltsin bothered to 
read during the final years of his presidency is uncertain. 
By the mid-1990s, when presented with his paperwork, he 
was already said to be frequently telling his long-suffering 
chief of staff, Viktor Ilyushin, not to bother him with “all 



that shit.”^^ Like Primakov before him, however, 
Tmbnikov had direct personal access to Yeltsin. In 1998 
he helped to shape Russian policy during the dispute over 
UN weapons inspection in Iraq. Soon afterwards he was 
present at the Moscow talks on Kosovo between Yeltsin 
and Slobodan Milosevic. Unnoticed by the media, 
Tmbnikov also accompanied Primakov on a visit to 
Belgrade in March 1999 for further discussions with 
Milosevic. Trough the SVR is not a supporter of Saddam 
Hussein or Milosevic, it does not wish either to be 
defeated by the West. 

By the mid-1990s, the internal security service (then 
the FSK, now the FSB) had recovered some of its former 
influence, though only a fraction of its previous authority. 
Sergei Stepashin, who became its chief in 1994, was one 
of Yeltsin’s closest advisers. A centrist politician with 
reformist credentials, he had declared in 1991, “The KGB 
must be liquidated.” Once head of the FSK, however, he 
complained that his service had been “castrated” and was 
demanding greater powers. His influence was clearly 
evident in the crisis over Chechnya. In the late summer of 
1994 Stepashin persuaded Yeltsin that an attack on 
Grozny, the Chechen capital, would overthrow its 
rebellious president, Dzhokhar Dudayev, almost 
overnight and bring Chechnya back under direct control 
from Moscow. The attack was to be mounted by 
Dudayev’s Chechen opponents, armed and financed by 
the FSK. When most of the Chechen opposition pulled 



out of the operation at the last moment in November, 
however, the FSK went ahead using Russian troops 
instead — with (as Stepashin later acknowledged) 
disastrous consequences. Dudayev repulsed the initial 
attack and paraded captured Russian soldiers before the 
world’s television cameras. Though Grozny later fell to 
Russian forces, the Chechens mounted a determined 
resistance from the countryside in a brutal war which, 
over the next two years, cost 25,000 lives. Yeltsin’s 
reputation never recovered. Stepashin was sacked in June 
1995 in an attempt to appease critics of the war in the 
Duma, but remained close to Yeltsin and was brought 
back into the government two years later, first as minister 
of justice, then in March 1998 as minister of the interior. 
In May 1999 Yeltsin chose him to succeed Primakov as 
prime minister. 

Yeltsin caused further incredulity by declaring that 
Putin would be the next President. The incredulity swiftly 
disappeared, however, when Putin launched a brutal, full- 
scale attack on the breakaway republic of Chechnya 
which achieved far greater short-term success than 
Yeltsin’s offensive five years earlier. Putin’s popularity in 
the opinion polls soared in only three months from 2 to 70 
percent. On New Year’s Eve, Yeltsin sprang his final 
surprise on Kremlin-watchers by stepping down from the 
presidency before the end of his term and announcing that 
Putin was succeeding him as acting president. The 
striking contrast between the infirm and alcoholic 



leadership of Yeltsin’s final years in office and the tough 
no-nonsense leadership style successfully cultivated by 
Putin during his first months in the Kremlin won him 
victory at the presidential elections in March 2000. 

THE SVR AND FSB ARE GUARANTEED powerful 
roles under the Putin presidency. Neither foresees a return 
to the Cold War. Both, indeed, now have well-established, 
though little-advertised, liaison arrangements with the 
main Western intelligence agencies. The SVR and FSB 
none the less expect a continuing conflict of interest with 
the West. 

They have good reason to do so. The collapse of the 
Soviet system has revealed a much older East- West 
faultline which has more to do with events in the fourth 
century AD than in the twentieth century. It follows the 
line not of the Cold War Iron Curtain but of the division 
between Orthodox and Catholic Christianity which began 
with the establishment of Constantinople as the New 
Rome in 330 and was made permanent by the schism 
between the Orthodox and Catholic churches in 1054. 
Though the Orthodox East was invaded by Islam and the 
unity of the Catholic West fractured by the Protestant 
Reformation, the cultural divide between East and West 
persisted. “From the time of the Crusades,” writes the 
historian Norman Davies, “the Orthodox looked on the 
West as a source of subjugation worse than the infidel.”^ ^ 
It is precisely because the faultline is so deeply 



entrenched that it is so difficult to overcomeJ^ Those east 
European states joining NATO at the end of the twentieth 
century, those likely to do so early in the twenty-first and 
the most probable future entrants into the European Union 
are all on the western side of the divide There is still no 
very promising candidate in Orthodox Europe. 

To most Russians, the welcome given by Western 
statesmen in the late 1980s to Gorbachev’s ambition of 
establishing Russia’s place in the “common European 
home” now seems hollow, if not hypocritical. “A Russia 
shut out and disconnected,” argued historian Jonathan 
Haslam, “will inevitably be troublesome.”^^ Despite 
Russian membership of the Council of Europe, the 
Russia-NATO Joint Council and other Western attempts 
to bridge the East-West divide, the enlargement of NATO 
and the planned expansion of the European Union 
confirm Russia’s relegation to the margins of Europe. The 
SVR, unsurprisingly, is resolutely opposed to both. Its 
opposition is strengthened by resentment at Russia’s 
national decline. In the space of a few months in 1989 the 
revolutions in eastern Europe destroyed the Soviet Bloc. 
Two years later Russia lost, even more suddenly, almost 
half the territory previously ruled from Moscow and 
found itself smaller than in the reign of Catherine the 
Great. The signs are that some — ^perhaps many — SVR 
officers share the belief of the current leader of the 
Russian Communist Party, Gennadi Zyuganov, in a long- 



term Western plan first to destroy the Soviet state and 
then to prevent a revival of Russian power. Russia’s 
historic mission, they believe, is to bar the way to 
American global hegemony and the triumph of Western 
values. 

The Yeltsin presidency was far too short a period for 
Russia to adjust to the disappearance of the Soviet Bloc 
and the break-up of the Soviet Union. Like post-war 
Britain, post-Communist Russia has, in Dean Acheson’s 
famous phrase, “lost an empire and not yet found a role.” 
But, whereas for Britain the loss of empire came at a time 
of political stability and economic recovery, in Russia it 
has been accompanied by economic collapse and political 
disintegration. Russia is in the unusual position at present 
of having a national anthem but little prospect of agreeing 
on words to go with it — one sign among many of its 
current crisis of national identity.^^ 

In the search for its own identity at the beginning of the 
twenty-first century, the SVR looks back to a heroic, 
reinvented version of its Soviet past. On December 20, 
1995 it celebrated the seventy-fifth anniversary of the 
founding of the Cheka’s foreign department as its own 
seventy-fifth birthday, and marked the occasion by 
publishing an uncritical eulogy of the “large number of 
glorious deeds” performed by Soviet foreign intelligence 
officers “who have made an outstanding contribution to 
guaranteeing the security of our Homeland.” The SVR 
copes with the unfortunate fact that some of its past 



heroes perpetrated or collaborated in the atrocities of the 
Great Terror by denying, absurdly, that they played any 
part in them. In the SVR version of the Terror, the sole 
involvement of foreign intelligence was to produce 
martyrs who “perished in the torture chambers of Yezhov 
and Beria.”^^ As head of the SVR, Primakov became 
“editor-in-chief’ of a multi-volume history of Soviet 
foreign intelligence designed to demonstrate that Soviet 
foreign intelligence “honorably and unselfishly did its 
patriotic duty to Motherland and people. Though 
Primakov’s history has yet to reach the Cold War era, it is 
already clear that there will be no place in it for any 
account of FCD involvement in the persecution of 
dissidents and the abuse of human rights. 

In 1996 the SVR issued a CD-ROM in both Russian 
and English, with the title Russian Foreign Intelligence: 
VChK [Cheka ]-KGB-SVR, which claims to give “for the 
first time ... a professional view on the history and 
development of one of the most powerful secret services 
in the world.” The aim throughout its multimedia 
celebration of past successes, such as the recruitment of 
the Magnificent Five and atomic espionage, is to 
emphasize the direct links between Soviet foreign 
intelligence and today’s SVR. The cover of the CD-ROM 
depicts the statue of Dzerzhinsky which the SVR and FSB 
now hope to see re-erected on its former pedestal outside 
the Lubyanka. Nothing better illustrates the continuity 
between the Soviet and Russian foreign intelligence 



services than the attempt by the SVR to reclaim its KGB 
past.

NOTES 



Chapter One The Mitrokhin Archive 


1. Nezavisimaya Gazeta, December 10, 1996; Reuter 
reports, December 10, 1996. 

2. Unless otherwise indicated, the account of Mitrokhin’ s 
career is based on his own recollections. Because of 
concern for his relatives in Russia, he is reluctant to reveal 
details of his family background. The SVR is still 
ferociously hostile to KGB defectors, whatever their 
motives. Most, even if — like Oleg Gordlevsky — they 
betrayed not Russia but the now discredited Soviet one- 
party state through ideological conviction, remain under 
sentence of death. Though their relatives no longer face 
the overt persecution of the Soviet era, many 
understandably prefer not to have them identified. 

3. For personal reasons, Mitrokhin does not wish to make 
public the location of this foreign posting, where he 
operated under an alias. 

4. On the fall of Beria, see Moskalenko, “Beria’s Arrest”; 
Volkogonov, The Rise and Fall of the Soviet Empire, pp. 
185-93; Knight, Beria, ch. 9. 

5. The FCD Archives, known in 1956 as the Operational 
Records Department (Otdel Operativnogo Ucheta), were 



subsequently renamed the Twelfth (later the Fifteenth) 
Department. 

6. Volkogonov, The Rise and Fall of the Soviet Empire, p. 
194. 

7. Fleishman, Boris Pasternak, chs. 11,12; Levi, Boris 
Pasternak, chs. 8, 9. 

8. Knight, The KGB, pp. 64-5. 

9. k-9,183. 

10. Medvedev, p. 56. 

11. Andrew and Gordlevsky, KGB, pp. 434-5, 483-4; 
Arbatov, The System, p. 266; Dobbs, Down With Big 
Brother, p. 13. 

12. k-25,l. 

13. k- 1,191. Because of the dissidents’ contacts (both real 
and imagined) with the West and the expulsion of some of 
their leaders, FCD archives included material on them 
from both the Second (internal security) Chief Directorate 
and the Fifth Directorate, founded by Andropov to 
specialize in operations by domestic ideological 
subversion. 

14. Mitrokhin later found evidence of similar plans to end 
the dancing career of another defector from the Kirov 
Ballet, Natalia Makarova. 

15. The approximate size of the FCD archive c. 1970 is 
given in vol. 6, ch. 2, part 1 . 

16. When FCD Directorate S at the Lubyanka asked to 
consult one of the files transferred to Yasenevo, 
Mitrokhin was also responsible for supervising its return. 



17. k-16,506. 

18. Blake, No Other Choice, p. 265. 

19. While working on the notes at the dacha, Mitrokhin 
kept them hidden at the bottom of a laundry basket, then 
buried them in the milk-chum before he left. He was not 
the first to bury a secret archive in a milk-chum. In the 
Warsaw Ghetto in 1942-3 Emanuel Ringelblum buried 
three chums, rediscovered after the Second World War, 
which contained a priceless collection of underground 
newspapers, reports on resistance networks, and the 
testimony of Jews who had escaped from the death 
camps. One of the milk-chums is among the exhibits at 
the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in 
Washington. 

20. Mitrokhin’ s archive is in four sections: 

(i) k-s cries: handwritten material filed in large 
envelopes 

(ii) t-s cries: handwritten notebooks 

(Hi) volumes: typed material, mostly arranged 
by country, sometimes with commentary by 
Mitrokhin 

(iv) frag. -series: miscellaneous handwritten 
notes 

Endnote references to Mitrokhin ’s archive follow this 
classification. 

2E Solzhenitsyn’s letter of complaint to Andropov and 
Andropov’s mendacious report on it to the Council of 
Ministers are published in Scammell (ed.). The 



Solzhenitsyn Files, pp. 158-60. See also Solzhenitsyn, The 
Oak and the Calf, pp. 322-3, 497-8; Scammell, 
Solzhenitsyn, pp. 739-43. 

22. Pipes (ed.). The Unknown Lenin, pp. 48-50. 

23. Solzhenitsyn, The Oak and the Calf, p. 1. 

24. Shentalinsky, The KGB's Literary Archive, pp. 80-1. 
In 1926 the OGPU had confiscated Bulgakov’s allegedly 
subversive diary. Though Bulgakov succeeded in getting 
it back a few years later, he himself subsequently burnt it 
for fear that it might provide evidence for his arrest. 
Happily, a copy survives in the KGB archives. 

25. “Some aspects of the political and moral- 
psychological situation among members of the Moscow 
Theatre of Drama and Comedy on the Taganka.” Report 
submitted to Andropov in July 1978 (k-25, appendix). 

26. Solzhenitsyn, The Oak and the Calf, pp. 2-4. 

27. See below, chapter 19. 

28. The Afghan War will be covered in volume 2. 

29. A characteristic example was a plan (document no. 
150/S-9195) for agent infiltration into Russian emigre 
communities to monitor and destabilize dissidents abroad, 
signed jointly by Kryuchkov and Bobkov (head of the 
Fifth Directorate), submitted to Andropov on August 19, 
1975, and approved by him a few days later; vol. 6, ch. 8, 
part 6. Kryuchkov now improbably maintains that he “had 
nothing to do with the struggle against dissenf ’ (Remnick, 
Resurrection, p. 322). 

30. vol. 10, ch. 3, para. 23. 



31. vol. 6, app. 2, parts 3, 4; k-2,323; k-5,169. 

32. Since he does not wish to reveal some details of his 
departure from the Soviet Union to the present Russian 
security service, Mitrokhin is unwilling to identify the 
Baltic republic in which he contacted SIS. 

33. Kessler, The FBI, p. 433. Despite its limitations, the 
story confirms Kessler’s well-deserved reputation for 
scoops. 

34. Michael Isikoff, “FBI Probing Soviet Spy Effort, 
Book Says,” Washington Post (August 18, 1993). 

35. “Fun and Games with the KGB,” Time (August 30, 
1993). 

36. The British media also assumed that the KGB defector 
had gone to the United States. See, for example, “Top US 
Officials ‘Spied For KGB,”’ The Times (August 19, 
1993); “KGB Recruited ‘Hundreds’ of American Spies,” 
Independent {August 19, 1993). 

37. The first exposure of Hemu’s alleged role as a Soviet 
Bloc agent was the article by Jerome Dupuis and Jean- 
Marie Pontaut, “Charles Hemu etait un agent de I’Est,” 
L ’Express (October 31, 1996). 

38. “Le contre-espionnage fran^ais est convaincu que 
Charles Hemu a ete un agent de I’Est,” Le Monde 
(October 31, 1996). For British versions of the Hemu 
story, see, inter alia, the reports in the Daily Telegraph, 
Guardian, Independent and The Times on October 31, 
1996, and in the Sunday Times and Sunday Telegraph on 
November 3, 1996. 



39. Since Mitrokhin’s notes, though voluminous, are not 
comprehensive, the absence of any identifiable reference 
to Hemu is not proof of his innocence, especially as his 
initial contacts were, allegedly, with Bulgarian and 
Romanian intelligence. Hemu’s family insist that he is 
innocent of the charges against him. 

40. Focus (December 1996, March 1997). Focus' ^ report 
in December 1996 provoked the vigorous SVR 
denunciation quoted at the beginning of this chapter. 

41. Andreas Weber, “Die ‘Grot’ geschluckt: Die 
Lageplane zu den KGB-Waffen- und Spreng-stoffdepots 
in Osterreich sind iiberaus prazise,” Profil (May 26, 

1997) . 

42. t-7,65. 

43. See below, chapter 22. 

44. Focus ( June 15, 1998). Other errors in the Focus 
story included the claim that the defector had “worked at 
KGB headquarters until the early 1990s.” 

45. Focus ( June 15, 1998). Roger Boyes, “Defector Says 
Willy Brandt was KGB Agent,” The Times ( June 16, 

1998) . 

46. ITAR/Tass interview with Yuri Kobaladze, June 19, 
1998. Butkov’s memoirs, so far available only in 
Norwegian, contain much of interest (including KGB 
documents) on his career in the FCD from 1984 to 1991, 
but include no reference to Brandt. In 1998, while living 
in Britain, Butkov was jailed for three years for his 
involvement in a confidence trick which persuaded 



companies in Russia and Ukraine to pay 1.5 pounds to 
enrol employees in a bogus business school in California.

Times (April 26, 1998).

57. Some of the KGB documents obtained by Gordievsky, 
all covering the period 1974 to 1985, were later published 
in Andrew and Gordievsky (eds.). Instructions from the 
Centre and More Instructions from the Centre. 

58. Unattributable information. Since Mitrokhin had 
retired six years before the publication of the history by 
Andrew and Gordievsky, he had no access to KGB files 



on it. 

59. Order of the Chairman of the KGB, no. 107/OV, 
September 5, 1990. 

60. Costello later told Andrew and Gordlevsky that he 
received the first order of KGB material shortly after the 
press conference to launch their book, at which he made 
an engagingly boisterous appearance to denounce their 
identification of John Caimcross as the Fifth Man as a 
plot by British intelligence. He subsequently changed his 
mind after seeing material from Caimcross ’s KGB file 
which confirmed that identification. 

61. Costello, Ten Days to Destiny. 

62. Costello and Tsarev, Deadly Illusions, pp. vi-vii. 
Costello’s untimely death in 1996 has been variously 
attributed by conspiracy theorists to the machinations of 
British or Russian intelligence. While Costello was 
somewhat naive in his attitude to the SVR, there is no 
suggestion that either he or any of the other Western 
authors (some of them distinguished scholars) of the 
collaborative histories authorized by the SVR have been 
Russian agents. 

63. The collaborative volumes so far published are, in 
order of publication: Costello and Tsarev, Deadly 
Illusions; Murphy, Kondrashev and Bailey, Battleground 
Berlin; Fursenko and Naftali, “One Hell of a Gamble''', 
West and Tsarev, The Crown Jewels; and Weinstein and 
Vassiliev, The Haunted Wood. Further publication details 
are given in the bibliography. 



64. Extracts from the Philby file appear in Costello, Ten 
Days to Destiny; Costello and Tsarev, Deadly Illusions; 
Borovik, The Philby Files; West and Tsarev, The Crown 
Jewels. 

65. See below, chapter 9. 

66. Murphy, Kondrashev and Bailey, Battleground Berlin, 
p. 248. The authors rightly describe the SVR’s claim that 
it has no file on Kopatzky/Orlov as “obviously 
disingenuous.” The SVR’s selection of documents for the 
most recent of the collaborative histories (on espionage in 
the USA in the Stalin era) shows some similar signs of 
archival amnesia on embarrassing episodes. It claims, for 
example, that “available records” do not indicate the fate 
of Vasili Mironov, a senior officer in the New York 
residency recalled to Moscow in 1944 (Weinstein and 
Vassiliev, The Haunted Wood, p. 275). In reality, his fate 
is precisely recorded in SVR files. After his recall, 
Mironov was first sent to labor camp, then shot after 
attempting to smuggle details of the NKVD massacre of 
Polish officers to the US embassy in Moscow. 

67. See below, chapter 9. 

68. Samolis (ed.), Veter any Vneshnei Razvedki Rossii. 
The editor, Tatyana Samolis, is spokeswoman for the 
SVR. One striking example of this volume’s reverential 
attitude towards the pious myths created by the KGB is its 
highly sanitized account of the frequently unsavory career 
of Hero of the Soviet Union Stanislav Alekseyevich 
Vaupshashov. 



69. Primakov et al, Ocherki Istorii Rossiyskoi Vneshnei 
Razvedki. Three volumes were published between 1995 
and 1997. They are based, in part, on formerly classified 
articles in the KGB in-house journal KGB Sbornik, some 
of which were noted by Mitrokhin. 

70. Though the former head of the SVR, Yevgeni 
Primakov (who in 1998 became Russian prime minister), 
was given the honorary title of “editor-in-chief’ of 
Ocherki Istorii Rossiyskoi Vneshnei Razvedki, his role can 
scarcely have been much more than nominal. As “literary 
editor,” Zamoysky is likely to have played a much more 
significant role. During the 1980s he regularly expounded 
his belief in a global Masonic-Zionist plot during briefing 
trips to foreign residencies. Oleg Gordlevsky heard him 
deliver a lecture on this subject during his visit to the 
London residency in January 1985; Zamoysky was then 
deputy head of the FCD Directorate of Intelligence 
Information. Andrew and Gordlevsky, KGB, p. 42. 

71. “Freemasons,” Zamoysky claimed, “have always 
controlled the upper echelons of government in Western 
countries ... Masonry in fact runs, ‘remotely controls’ 
bourgeois society ... The true center of the world Masonic 
movement is to be found in the most ‘Masonic’ country of 
all, the United States ... Ronald Reagan has been 
characterized as an ‘outstanding’ Mason.” Zamoysky ’s 
explanation of the Cold War was startling in its 
simplicity: 



The first ever atomic attack on people, the use of 
atomic weapons for blackmail and the escalation of 
the arms race were sanctioned by the 3 3 -degree 
Mason Harry Truman. 

The first ever call for the Cold War was sounded 
by Mason Winston Churchill (with Truman’s 
blessing). 

The onslaught on the economic independence of 
Western Europe (disguised as the Marshall Plan) was 
directed by the 33-degree Mason George Marshall. 

Truman and West European Freemasons 
orchestrated the formation of NATO. 

Don’t we owe to that cohort the instigation of 
hostility between the West and the Soviet Union ...? 

{Behind the Facade of the Masonic Temple, pp. 6-7, 141.) 

An important part of the explanation for the survival of 
some old KGB conspiracy theories into today’s SVR is 
the continuity of personnel. 

72. The third and latest volume of the SVR official 
history, which ends in 1941, concludes that Soviet foreign 
intelligence “honorably and unselfishly did its patriotic 
duty to Motherland and people.” Primakov et al, Ocherki 
Istorii Rossiyskoi Vneshnei Razvedki, vol. 3, conclusion. 

73. That is why the SVR selected as the first subject for a 
collaborative history between one of its own consultants 
and a Western historian a biography of Aleksandr Orlov, 
a senior foreign intelligence officer who, despite being 



forced to flee to the West from Stalin’s Terror, allegedly 
kept “faith with Lenin’s revolution” and used his superior 
intelligence training to take in Western intelligence 
agencies for many years. Costello and Tsarev, Deadly 
Illusions.

13. Before his execution, Kanneglser was twice 
Interrogated personally by Dzerzhinsky. Though he had 
formerly been an active member of the Workers’ Popular 
Socialist Party, he claimed — perhaps to protect other 



supporters of the Party — that, “as a matter of principle,” 
he was not currently a member of any party. Kannegiser 
said that he had carried out the assassination entirely on 
his own to avenge those shot on Uritsky’s orders as 
“enemies of Soviet power.” According to his father, one 
of those shot had been a friend of Kannegiser. The family 
maid, Ilinaya, claimed that Kannegiser “was linked with 
some suspicious people who often came to see him, and 
that he himself would disappear from his house at night, 
returning only during the day.” Rozenberg, another 
witness interrogated by the Cheka, claimed that 
Kannegiser had told him of his plan to overthrow the 
Bolshevik regime. Mitrokhin noted, after reading the 
Cheka interrogation records, that the conflicts in evidence 
had not been resolved, vol. 10, ch. 4. 

14. The record of Kaplan’s interrogation was published in 
1923; Pipes, The Russian Revolution, p. 807.

determination about changing the day of the month as 
well as the year of his birth in official records may have 
reflected the fear that Okhrana records contained some 
reference which had been overlooked to an agent, 
otherwise identified only by codename, who had his date 
of birth. 

27. On June 11, 1919 the Central Committee of the 
Russian Communist Party stated: “[ We] have noted 
Comrade Dzerzhinsky’s announcement concerning the 
necessity of leaving illegal political workers in the areas 
occupied by the enemy ... It is proposed that: (a) An 
Illegals Operations Department be created in the 
organizational office ...” (vol. 6, ch. 5, part l,n. 1).

31. There is little doubt that The State and Revolution 



represented Lenin’s innermost convictions. Had it been 
otherwise, he would scarcely have chosen to publish it in 
February 1918, at a time when the Cheka was already in 
existence and it was only too easy for Lenin’s opponents 
to point to the contradictions between his words and his 
deeds. Its publication at such a difficult time was an act of 
faith that the regime’s difficulties were only temporary 
and that he would live to see the fulfillment of his 
revolutionary dream. 

32. Report from the Cheka of the town and district of 
Morshansk in the first issue of the Cheka weekly, dated 
September 22, 1918 (k-9,212). 

33. Mitrokhin noted the following report (k-9,210) of an 
inspection by Cheka headquarters of Cheka operations in 
Dmitrov in 1918: 

Kurenkov, aged 18, operates as the chairman of the 
Dmitrov town Cheka of Moscow province. All his 
colleagues are young people, but young people who 
are competent, battle-tested and who work with 
energy. 

However, the work of the Cheka was carried out 
in a primitive manner. Searches were carried out 
without elected observers and without 
representatives of housing committees being present. 
Confiscated food stuffs were not handed over to the 
food department, and inventories were not drawn up.

48. The first of five foreign intelligence priorities set out 
in INO instmctions of November 28, 1922 was “The 



exposure on the territory of each state of counter- 
revolutionary groups who are waging both active and 
passive activity against the interests of the RSFSR and 
also against the international revolutionary movement.” 
vol. 7, ch. 1. 

49. Mitrokhin’s handwritten note (k-9,87) makes it 
difficult to determine whether the date was June 16 or 26. 
Since Zavamy crossed into Romania on June 15 to 
negotiate details of Tutyunnik’s return with him, it seems 
highly unlikely, particularly in view of earlier delays, that 
this could have taken place as early as June 16. Because 
CASE 39 was run by the internal departments of the 
OGPU, the file was kept in the special archival collections 
of the Second Chief Directorate, to which Mitrokhin did 
not have access. He was, however, able to note a 
classified history of the operation which was based on, 
and quoted, the CASE 39 file. 

50. k-9,87. During the 1930s an illegal residency in 
Germany, headed by I. M. Kaminsky (codenamed 
MOREZ and MOND), specialized in operations against 
Ukrainian emigres (vol. 7, ch. 9, paras. 1-2; vol. 6, ch. 5, 
part 1). The Administration for Special Tasks also carried 
out the assassination of several leading Ukrainian 
nationalists (Sudoplatovs, Special Tasks, chs. 1,2). 

51. vol. 6, ch. 8, part 6. 

52. vol. 6, ch. 5, part I, n. 1. Though Mitrokhin read a 
number of classified studies of the TREST and 
SINDIKAT operations, he did not have access to the files 



on them. Since the operations were run by the internal 
departments of the OGPU, their files — like that for CASE 
39 — were kept in the special archival collections 
{spetsfondi) of the Second Chief Directorate.

59. The complex use of multiple aliases for the same 
individual in the 3 7- volume TREST file, together with the 
baffling mixture of fact and invention recorded in it, 
confused a number of the KGB officers and historians 
who studied it over the years.

12 Iff. The brief SVR biography of Syroyezhkin identifies 
him as “especially prominent in the arrests of the 
subversive White Guard organization of B. Savinkov” and 
“an active participant in operation TREST during which 



the British agent S. Reilly was detained and arrested in 
September 1925.” Samolis (ed.), Veterany Vneshnei

63. vol. 7, ch. 14, item 1. Italian- Soviet diplomatic 
relations, broken after the Revolution, were not resumed 
until 1924, when the first legal residency was founded 
within the newly established Soviet diplomatic mission. 
The residency officer credited by KGB files with 
Constantin! ’s recruitment was Sheftel, codenamed 
DOCTOR. Mitrokhin’s notes give no further details on 
him. In 1997-8 the SVR gave privileged access to selected 
parts of Constantin! ’s file to the authors of two histories 
of Soviet intelligence operations: Primakov et al, Ocherki 
Istorii Rossiyskoi Vneshnei Razvedki, vol. 3, ch. 13; and 
West and Tsarev, The Crown Jewels, ch. 5. Primakov et 
al do not reveal Constantin!’ s real name; West and 
Tsarev mistakenly refer to him as Costantini. 

64. KGB files radically revise previous interpretations of 
leaks from the Rome embassy. A 1937 inquiry conducted 
by Valentine Vivian, head of SIS counter-intelligence, 
considered only leakage of classified documents to Italian 
intelligence. Though it was later discovered that some 
information had also gone to the OGPU/NKVD, the 
Foreign Office seems never to have realized that the 
original penetration was by the OGPU.

Ussuriysk (k-9,73). Neither is mentioned in the account of

scholars, unaware of the OGPU’s success at this period in 
intercepting Japanese communications in Harbin and 
Seoul, as a forgery fabricated by the OGPU. The KGB 
record of its interception, however, describes it as 



genuine. It is possible, though Mitrokhin discovered no 
evidence of this, that the published version was doctored 
to improve its propaganda value.

76. vol. 7, ch. 9, item 1. There is interesting detail on the 
Ilk- Weinstein residency in West and Tsarev, The Crown 
Jewels, ch. 3. The authors do not, however, appear to 
have had access to all the files seen by Mitrokhin, and 
conclude that the residency of Ilk and “Wanshtein” {sic — 
presumably a literal retransliteration from the Cyrillic) 
was “extremely effective” and pay tribute to “Ilk’s great 
organizational skill.” This judgment is somewhat at 
variance with the authors’ acknowledgement that the 
quality of the residency’s abundant British intelligence 
“left much to be desired”; the documents which they cite 
on Ilk’s attempts to excuse the quality of the intelligence 
probably deserve a less charitable interpretation. Both Ilk 
and Weinstein are conspicuous by their absence from the 
biographies of seventy-five foreign intelligence heroes 
published by the SVR in 1995 on the seventy- fifth 
anniversary of the founding of the Cheka’s foreign 
department. Since the “Great Illegals” of the inter-war 



period are included, the SVR evidently accepts that Ilk 
and Weinstein were not among them.

his memoirs, delivered an additional eight or nine secret 
batches of correspondence from Moscow which, he 
claimed, kept him informed of “everything that was going 
on” in the capital. Trotsky replied to his Moscow 
informants by the same secret channel (Trotsky, My Life, 
p. 556). The KGB archives identify the “special courier” 
as a member of the carters’ cooperative which transported 
freight between Alma-Ata and the nearest railway station 
in Frunze. OGPU surveillance teams reported that the 
carter would meet Trotsky’s wife or elder son in the 
Alma-Ata market place, unobtrusively slip into their 
shopping baskets messages which had arrived at Frunze 
by the Trans-Siberian Express and collect the replies, vol.

Volkogonov suggests that Blyumkin “was guilty of 
nothing more than having visited Trotsky” {Trotsky, p.

acknowledged that Blyumkin was “trying to establish a 
connection between Trotsky and his co-thinkers in the 
USSR.” Article signed “G. Gourov” [Trotsky] in La Voix

discrepancies between these memoirs, based on the 
authors’ varying personal knowledge of the affair. All 
agree, however, on Blyumkin’s meeting with Trotsky, 
Gorskaya’s involvement and Blyumkin’s execution. The 
records noted by Mitrokhin contain no details of 
Blyumkin’s recall to Moscow or of his interrogation; they 
mention only Blyumkin’s attempt to set up “a line of 
communication for Trotsky with the Trotskyites in 
Moscow” and his subsequent execution, vol. 6, ch. 3, part

3. In 1930 there was no legal residency in the United 
States and only one illegal residency, staffed by four 
OGPU officers and four illegal agents. Much of the 
Centre’s interest in the USA at this stage lay in the 
possibilities for operations against Germany and Japan 
offered by its large communities of expatriate Germans 
and Japanese, vol. 6, ch. 8, part 1. 

4. vol. 7, ch. 9. The aim in 1930, never completely 
fulfilled, was to establish several illegal residencies in 
every major target country. By contrast, no country in the 
1930s contained more than one legal residency.

illegal it wished to recruit.

9. See above, chapter 2. 

10. As with many other inter-war operations, the record of 
Bystroletov’s foreign intelligence missions is incomplete. 
The main documents seen by Mitrokhin were a post-war 
memoir written by Bystroletov, some contemporary 
correspondence on his operations exchanged between the 
Center and residencies, and the 26-volume file on one of 
his leading agents, Ernest Holloway Oldham (ARNO). 
Though Bystroletov’s memoir is colorfully written, some 
— ^but not all — of the main events recorded in it can be 
corroborated from other sources. The SVR has given 
partial access to its records on Bystroletov for the writing 
of two books co-authored by the former KGB officer 
Oleg Tsarev (now an SVR consultant) and Western 
historians: Costello and Tsarev, Deadly Illusions; and 
West and Tsarev, The Crown Jewels. 

11. Samolis (ed.), Veterany Vneshnei Razvedki Rossii, pp. 
19-21. The account of Bystroletov’s career in the 1997 
SVR official history also omits much that is of 
importance about it, including the identities of his main 
British agents. Primakov et al, Ocherki Istorii Rossiyskoi 
Vneshnei Razvedki, ch. 22. 

12. vol. 7, ch. 9, para. 16. The file noted by Mitrokhin 



identifies LAROCHE, in Cyrillic transliteration, as Eliana 
Aucouturier, bom 1898. Samolis (ed.), Veterany Vneshnei 
Razvedki Rossii, says simply that Bystroletov 
“successfully cultivated a secretary at the French embassy 
who had access to secret correspondence and ciphers of 
the French foreign ministry” (p. 19), but does not give the 
secretary’s name or codename, or refer to her seduction. 

13. vol. 7, ch. 9. 

14. The accounts of Bystroletov ’s career published by the 
SVR in 1995 and 1997, as well as the material supplied 
by the SVR for two books co-authored by the former 
KGB officer Oleg Tsarev and Western historians, do not 
mention that Bystroletov was not an OGPU/NKVD 
officer. Mitrokhin discovered, on examining 
Bystroletov’ s records, that he was simply an agent (vol. 7, 
ch. 9, para. 38). Even when fully rehabilitated in 1956, 
after spending sixteen years in prison from 1938 to 1954 
as an innocent victim of the Stalinist terror, Bystroletov 
was denied a KGB pension on the grounds that he had 
never held officer rank. Since the SVR now portrays him 
as one of the main pre-war heroes of Soviet foreign 
intelligence, it is evidently embarrassed to admit his lowly 
status. 

15. Though based in Berlin, Bazarov’s residency operated 
against a number of countries, including — from 1929 — 
Britain. Other illegals in the residency included Teodor 
Maly and D. A. Poslendy, vol. 7, ch. 1. 

16. vol. 7, ch. 9, paras. 24-30. De Ry later also came to 



the attention of the French Deuxieme Bureau as ''un 
trafiquant de codes'' with access to Italian ciphers 
(Paillole, Notre espion chez Hitler, p. 223). 

17. vol. 7, ch. 9, para. 26. Though not present at this first 
encounter with ROSSI, Bystroletov was given details of it 
by the Paris residency in order to help track him down. 

18. In Bystroletov’s account (vol. 7, ch. 9, para. 26), the 
official who spoke to the walk-in at the Paris embassy is 
identified only as “a senior comrade.” Other fragmentary 
accounts of the same episode indicate that the comrade 
was Vladimir Voynovich, aka Yanovich and Volovich: 
Bessedovsky, Revelations of a Soviet Diplomat, pp. 247- 
8; Corson and Crowley, The New KGB, pp. 433-5; 
Costello and Tsarev, Deadly Illusions, p. 198. 

19. vol. 7, ch. 9, para. 27. The photographer of the ciphers 
was identified as Voynovich ’s wife by the defector 
Grigori Besedovsky, then a senior diplomat in the Soviet 
embassy. Bessedovsky, Revelations, p. 247. 

20. vol. 7, ch. 9. Corson and Crowley, The New KGB, pp. 
140ff confuses the de Ry and Oldham cases, and claims 
that Oldham too was successfully defrauded. The authors, 
who had no access to KGB files, do not identify de Ry by 
name or codename and refer to Oldham as “Scott.” 
Andrew and Gordlevsky, {KGB, pp. 195-6) identify 
Oldham but follow Corson and Crowley in suggesting 
that he was defrauded by Voynovich. Surprisingly, 
Costello and Tsarev, despite their access to KGB 
documents, make no mention of de Ry and claim 



inaccurately in their paragraph on Oldham that he “was 
thrown out on his ear” by Voynovich, who “evidently 
suspected a British provocation plot” {Deadly Illusions, p. 
198). 

21. Besedovsky’s memoirs, Na Putiakh k Termidoru, 
were published in Russian, French and German in 1930; 
an abridged English translation (in which the author’s 
name is transliterated as “Bessedovslay”) appeared in 
1931. His insulting references to Stalin make the 
hypothesis that he was a bogus defector planted on the 
West untenable. There is, however, some indication that 
in the course of a sometimes bizarre life in exile, 
Besedovsky did co-operate to some degree with Soviet 
intelligence after the Second World War.

26. The only real post with which the non-existent 
position of head of intelligence at the Foreign Office 
might conceivably have been confused was that of head 
of political intelligence in SIS and liaison officer with the 
Foreign Office. The holder of that post from 1921 to early 
in the Second World War, however, was Major Malcolm 
Woollcombe.

32. French cryptanalysts were unable to exploit the 
intelligence on Enigma provided by Schmidt. The first 
steps in the breaking of Enigma were made by Polish 
military cryptanalysts with whom the Deuxieme Bureau 
shared Schmidt’s cipher material. The results achieved by 
the Poles were passed on to the British on the eve of the 
Second World War, Garlinski, Intercept, chs. 2, 3; 
Andrew, Secret Service, pp. 628-32. 

33. vol. 7, ch. 9, para. 30. Neither Lemoine’s name nor his 
codename, JOSEPH, appears in Bystroletov’s 1995 SVR 
hagiography, which, however, confirms that “In the 
period between 1930 and 1936, whilst working with 
another agent, Bystroletov ... established operational 
contact with a member of French military intelligence. He 
received from him Austrian cipher material and later 
Italian and Turkish cipher material and even secret 
documents from Hitler’s Germany.” (Samolis (ed.), 
Veter any Vneshnei Razvedki Rossii, p. 20.) It is clear from 



this censored account that Bystroletov’s fellow illegal 
Ignace Reiss (alias Ignace Poretsky), with whom he 
shared the running of JOSEPH, remains an unperson in 
SVR historiography because of his later defection; he is 
referred to only as “another agent.” There is no mention 
of JOSEPH in the account of Bystroletov’s career in West 
and Tsarev, The Crown Jewels. 

34. The file noted by Mitrokhin identifies OREL only as 
Lemoine’s boss in the Deuxieme Bureau; the Center may 
not have known his real identity (vol. 7, ch. 9, para. 30). 
Reiss was known to Lemoine and Bertrand as “Walter 
Scott.” A Deuxieme Bureau photograph, almost certainly 
taken without Reiss’s knowledge, shows him at a meeting 
with Lemoine and Bertrand at Rotterdam in 1935 
(Paillole, Notre espion chez Hitler, illustration facing p. 
161).

36. Paillole, Notre espion chez Hitler, p. 132. Which side

however, record that OREL (Bertrand) handed Reiss a 
new Italian cipher in November 1933.

Bystroletov his inscribed rifle is recorded in KGB files as

previously used an Austrian passport in the name of

well have used the same false identity in Italy. 
Significantly, the SVR version of Akselrod’s early career 



omits all mention of his membership of Poale Zion. The 
KGB tradition that Soviet intelligence heroes were 
untainted by Zionism appears to be preserved by SVR 
historians. Primakov et ah, Ocherki Istorii Rossiyskoi

Benes and Mussolini are published in Medlicott et al

2nd series, vol. 12, pp. 703-46, 771-91, 803-10, 812-17; 
vol. 13, pp. 477-84; vol. 14, pp. 329-33. The version of 
the record of Simon’s and Eden’s talks with Hitler given 
to Stalin consisted of translated extracts rather than the 
full Foreign Office document. The same probably applies 
to the records given to Stalin of Eden’s talks with 
Litvinov, Beck, Benes and Mussolini, which are not yet 
accessible. 

56. Constantin! may well not have been the only source 
for the document. The Foreign Office record of Simon’s 
and Eden’s talks with Hitler, also in March 1935, was

61. The report by a committee headed by Sir John Maffey 
concluded that British interests in and around Ethiopia 
were not sufficient to justify opposition to Italian 
conquest. Mussolini’s decision to publish it in February 
1936, at a time when the British government was 
considering oil sanctions against Italy, caused predictable 
embarrassment in the Foreign Office. Dilks, “Flashes of 
Intelligence,” pp. 107-8. Andrew, Secret Service, pp. 567- 
8. There is no mention of the Italian publication of the 
Maffey report in the two accounts of Constantini’s career 
based on authorized access to selected material from his 
file: West and Tsarev, The Crown Jewels, ch. 5; Primakov 
et al, Ocherki Istorii Rossiyskoi Vneshnei Razvedki, vol.

62. According to Mitrokhin’s notes on KGB files, 
Francesco Constantin! lost his job at the British embassy 
in 1936 (vol. 7, ch. 14, item 1). The current SVR version 
of his career claims that Constantin! was sacked in 1931. 
(West and Tsarev, The Crown Jewels, ch. 5; Primakov et 
ah, Ocherki Istorii Rossiyskoi Vneshnei Razvedki, vol. 3, 
ch. 13.) In Mitrokhin’s notes Constantini’s codename 
appears as DUDFEN — ^probably an error of transcription 



for DUDLEY.

68. The exact nature of the Centre’s confused suspicions 
about Francesco Constantini at the height of the Great 
Terror in 1937 are unclear. Mitrokhin’s one-sentence 
summary of the suspicions recorded in DUNCAN’ s file 
reads as follows: “He was in contact with the OVRA 
[Italian intelligence], was engaged in extortion, and the 
documents were probably supplied by the Special 
[intelligence] Services” (vol. 7, ch. 14, item 1. Cf. West

note “Copyright 1929 by Munster- Verlag (Dr. Arnold 
Deutsch), Wien II.” When he later wrote a classified 
memoir for NKVD files, Deutsch seems to have 
considered it imprudent to mention his previous close 
association with the sex-pol movement and Reich, who by 
then was engaged in a somewhat bizarre program of 



research on human sexual behavior. There is no mention 
of Reich either in Mitrokhin’s notes on the Deutsch file or 
in the two works by authors given some access to it by the 
SVR: Costello and Tsarev, Deadly Illusions, and West 
and Tsarev, The Crown Jewels. The 1997 SVR official 
history also makes no mention of Deutsch’ s involvement 
with Reich or the sex-pol movement in its hagiographic 
chapter on him; Primakov et al, Ocherki Istorii

14. A similar stroke of chance explains why Cambridge 
produced more British codebreakers than Oxford in both 
world wars. The Director of Naval Education in 1914, Sir 
Alfred Ewing, was a former professor of engineering at 
Cambridge. He recruited three Fellows of his former 
college. King’s, who themselves became recruiters a 
quarter of a century later. In the Second World War, one 
third of the King’s fellowship served in the wartime 
SIGINT agency at Bletchley Park — a far higher 
proportion than those recruited from any other Oxbridge 
college.

28. This claim appears in Orlov’s file; vol. 5, ch. 7. In 
reality, Orlov did not meet Philby until Deutsch 
introduced him in Paris in 1937, a few months before 
Orlov’s defection; West and Tsarev, The Crown Jewels, 

p. 110. 

29. Costello and Tsarev, Deadly Illusions, ch. 15. Though 
containing valuable material from KGB archives on the 
recmitment of British agents in the 1930s, this SVR- 
sponsored volume not merely inflates Orlov’s importance 
but is also misleading in some other respects. It omits 



James Klugmann (agent MER) from the list of early 
Cambridge recruits, and even implies that he was not 
recruited because of his open Party membership. It also 
wrongly identifies the agent who provided the first 
intelligence on the plan to build an atomic bomb in 1941 
as Maclean rather than Caimcross. (Since Caimcross, 
alone of the Five, was still alive at the time of publication 
in 1993, the intention may have been to limit the material 
on him to aspects of his career already admitted by him. 
The SVR now acknowledges that the atomic intelligence 
supplied by the London residency in 1941 came from 
Caimcross, not Maclean.) Among other examples of 
misleading mystification is the claim that agent ABO was 
a Cambridge contemporary of the “Magnificent Five,” 
who had never been identified as a Soviet spy. In reality, 
ABO was Peter Smollett, who graduated from Vienna, not 
Cambridge, University; his career as a Soviet agent had 
already been discussed in Andrew and Gordievsky, KGB, 
pp. 334-9. 

30. This is acknowledged, though somewhat lost sight of, 
in Costello and Tsarev, Deadly Illusions. In a number of 
respects the detailed evidence advanced by this volume is 
at odds with its overstatement of Orlov’s importance by 
comparison with Deutsch. The 1997 SVR official history 
upgrades Deutsch’ s role to that of “the man who started 
the ‘Cambridge Five’ Primakov et al, Ocherki Istorii 
Rossiyskoi Vneshnei Razvedki, vol. 3, ch. 1. Cf. West and 
Tsarev, The Crown Jewels, pp. 103ff. 



31. West and Tsarev {The Crown Jewels, pp. 103ff) give 
greater emphasis to Deutsch’s role by companion with 
Orlov’s than Costello and Tsarev, Dangerous Illusions. 
Their analysis, however, does not take account of the 
published material on Deutsch derived from the Vienna 
University Archives, the Dokumentationsarchiv des 
Osterreichischen Widerstandes, the work of Wilhelm 
Reich published by Deutsch and the information obtained 
by Oleg Gordlevsky during his career in the KGB (see 
Andrew and Gordlevsky, KGB, ch. 5). 

There is a considerable overlap between the KGB 
documents on Deutsch noted by Mitrokhin and those cited 
in West and Tsarev, The Crown Jewels. Each set of 
documents, however, contains material missing from the 
other. West and Tsarev do not, for example, appear to 
have seen Deutsch’s important memorandum on the 
recruitment of student Communists. However, Mitrokhin 
did not note the interesting documents on Deutsch 
following his recall to Moscow late in 1937 which are 
cited by West and Tsarev.

successive meetings with Burgess, Klugmann and 
Deutsch agrees with KGB records both as noted by 
Mitrokhin and in the documents cited in West and Tsarev, 
The Crown Jewels. The Enigma Spy is, none the less, a 
textbook case of psychological denial. At almost every 
stage of his career as a Soviet agent (save for a heroic 
year at Bletchley Park in 1942-3, when he claims that the 
intelligence he provided on the eastern front was 
instrumental in “changing the course of World War 
Two”), Caimcross seeks to diminish or deny the 
significance of his role. His version of his career as a 
Soviet agent, save for the year at Bletchley Park, is 
comprehensively contradicted by the evidence of the 
KGB files.

72. There are very few references to such documents 
either in Mitrokhin ’s notes or in the material from KGB 
archives made available by the SVR for West and Tsarev, 
The Crown Jewels. 

73. Though there is no positive evidence that this 
document was provided by Caimcross or Maclean, other 
sources can be excluded. The Center had recently broken 
contact with the two other agents who provided it with 
Foreign Office documents, Francesco Constantin! and 
Captain John King. Since Halifax’s record of his meeting 



with Hitler was not apparently sent as a telegram, the 
NKVD copy of it cannot have been obtained by SIGINT.

SVR official history makes a partial attempt to justify the 

antl-Trotskylst witch-hunt: 

[Trotskyist] criticism, though apparently aimed at 
Stalin personally, was essentially defamatory of 
everything Soviet. Largely thanks to the Trotskyists, 
a phenomenon developed abroad which became 
known as anti- Sovietism, which for many years hurt 
the USSR’s domestic and foreign policy pursued at 
that time, as well as the International workers’ and 
communists’ movement ... The Trotskyists were a 
fruitful agent base for the [Western] Intelligence 



services.

reasonably but wrongly — that only “political,” rather than 
“physical,” assassination was intended. Kriegel and

21. Among the growing number of studies of the Terror, 
the classic account remains that by Robert Conquest, The 
Great Terror: A Reassessment. There is, however, 
vigorous controversy over the numbers of the Terror’s 
victims. In 1995 Colonel Grashoven, head of the Russian 
security ministry rehabilitation team, estimated that in the 
period 1935-45 18 million were arrested and 7 million 
shot. Olga Shatunovskaya, a member of Khrushchev’s 
rehabilitation commission, gave the figure of those 
“repressed” (imprisoned or shot) from 1935 to 1941 as 
19.8 million (a statistic also found in the papers of 
Anastas Mikoyan). Dmitri Volkogonov arrived at a total 
of 21.5 million (of whom a third were shot) for the period 
1929-53. Conquest’s own revised estimates are of a 
similar order of magnitude (Conquest, “Playing Down the 
Gulag,” p. 8). Recent studies based on incomplete official 
records suggest considerably lower, but still large figures. 
Stephen Wheatcroft, one of the leading analysts of the 
official figures, believes it “unlikely that there were more 
than a million executions between 1921 and 1953. The 
labor camps and colonies never accounted for more than 
2.5 million prisoners.” What is striking even in the 



official records is the enormous rise in executions during 
the Great Terror: 353,074 in 1937 and 328,618 in 1938, as 
compared with a total of under 10,000 for the five year 
period 1932-6 (Wheatcroft, “The Scale and Nature of 
German and Soviet Repression and Mass Killings, 1930- 
45”). Controversy over the level of incompleteness in the 
official records (which do not, of course, include deaths in 
the camps or the millions who died from famine) will 
doubtless continue.

contact with Burgess, he handed over material for the 
CPGB through MARY [Litzi Philby] and EDITH [Tudor 
Hart]”; vol. 7, ch. 10, app., item 4. He appears to have had 
little success. During a visit to the United States in the 
summer of 1940 he sought Straight’s help in re- 
establishing contact, telling him, “I’ve been out of touch 
with our friends for several months” (Straight, After Long

special services were following, and perhaps in some 
sense influencing, events” (p. 454). On the gaps in the 
KGB files on operation UTKA, see Primakov et al,

104. Levine, The Mind of an Assassin, p. 221. Though 

acknowledging Eitingon’s “deserved reputation as a man 
of many affairs with women,” Sudoplatov argues 
unconvincingly that his “close” relationship with Caridad 
Mercader did not involve sex, since this would have been 
a breach of regulations; Special Tasks, p. 70, 2. 



105. On the codenames of Caridad and Ramon Mercader, 
see Primakov et ah, Ocherki Istorii Rossiyskoi Vneshnei

Grigulevich’s career in the Spanish Civil War appears in 
the 1997 SVR official history of pre-war intelligence 
operations. No reference, however, is made to his role in 
the first major attempt to assassinate Trotsky, doubtless 
for fear of tarnishing his heroic image. Though the 
chapter on Trotsky’s assassination refers to FELIPE, it 
gives no indication that FELIPE and Grigulevich were 
one and the same. Primakov et al, Ocherki Istorii

General Leandro Sanchez Salazar, later reached the same 
conclusion. Though able to identify Grigulevich only as 
FELIPE (his codename within the assault group), Sanchez 



Salazar described him as “the real instigator of the 
attack.” Sanchez Salazar believed the multilingual 
Grigulevich to be “a French Jew,” partly as a result of 
discovering some of his underwear, which had been 
purchased in Paris on the Boulevard Saint Michel.

Intelligence School (RASH) of the NKVD First (Foreign 
Intelligence) Directorate, and the training course extended 
to two years. By the end of the war about 200 foreign 
intelligence officers had graduated from it (k- 
27,appendix). During the Cold War it was known 
successively as the Higher Intelligence School 
(codenamed School no. 101), the Red Banner Institute 
and the Andropov Institute. In October 1994 it became the 
Foreign Intelligence Academy of the Russian Federation

in 1953 (Andrew and Gordlevsky, KGB, p. 304). The

they have been unable to establish the date of Gorsky’s

recollection of a former head of the Centre’s British desk 
that he provided “tons of documents” (Andrew and 
Gordlevsky, KGB, p. 272). Confident that his file would 
never see the light of day, Caimcross denied that he 
provided anything of significance to the London 
residency until after the Soviet Union entered the war. He 
admitted, however, that he had “no difficulty in having 
access to the secret papers in Hankey’s office” 
(Caimcross, The Enigma Spy, pp. 90-1). When new War 
Cabinet regulations in June 1941 limited the circulation of 
diplomatic telegrams to Hankey, Caimcross as well as 
Hankey complained personally to the Foreign Office. The 
restrictions were quickly lifted. (G. L. Glutton (Foreign

reports reached Stalin, and in what form, cannot be 



determined at present. But, given both the volume of 
highly classified intelligence from London and the 
numerous JIC assessments which contradicted Churchill’s 
belief that Hitler was planning an invasion of Russia, 
Stalin must surely have been aware of the JIC view. The 
files noted by Mitrokhin show that Stalin had access to at 
least some of the telegrams exchanged between the 
Foreign Office and the British ambassador in Moscow, 
Sir Stafford Cripps. vol. 7, ch. 2, para. 10.

important new study by Gabriel Gorodetsky, Grand 
Delusion: Stalin and the German Invasion of Russia, was 
published just as this volume was going to press. It 
performs a valuable service by demolishing the main 
conspiracy theories (in particular those surrounding 
Hess’s flight to Britain and Stalin’s alleged preparations 
for an attack on Germany) which have confused some 
recent interpretations of the background of operation 
BARBAROSSA. Though there are some gaps in his 
analysis of Soviet intelligence. Professor Gorodetsky also 
adds much interesting detail from newly accessible 
Russian archives. His portrait of Stalin as “rational and 
level-headed” is, however, difficult to reconcile with, 
inter alia, Stalin’s obsessive pursuit of Trotsky and his 
foreign supporters. Grand Delusion is, none the less, a 
major work.

NKVD First (Foreign Intelligence) Directorate as a new

51. Dear and Foot (eds.), The Oxford Companion to the 
Second World War, p. 1240. Probably the best study of 
the eastern front, by Professor Richard Overy, concludes 
that, “... Where the NKVD did intervene the effect was to 
wound the war effort, not to invigorate it.” One part of the 
complex explanation for increasing success of the Red 
Army was the demotion, under the pressure of war, of the 
political apparatchiks at the front in the autumn of 1942 
and the new freedom given to officers to take decisions 
without being constantly checked for political correctness. 
Overy, Russia ’s War, pp. 329-30. 

52. There was no legal residency in Argentina. At the 
outbreak of war no Latin American state had diplomatic 
relations with the Soviet Union. In October 1942 Cuba 
established diplomatic relations with the USSR. By the 



beginning of 1945 another eight Latin American republics 
had followed suit. Argentina did not establish diplomatic 
relations with the Soviet Union until 1946. 

53. vol. 6, ch. 5, part 1. Mitrokhin’s notes, which identify 
ARTUR as Grigulevich, provide the solution to a major 
unsolved problem in the VENONA decrypts. Though the

identity was never discovered by NS A or the FBI 
(Benson, VENONA Historical Monograph #5, p. 5).

1. Andrew and Gordlevsky, KGB, pp. 241-2. At least in 
the early 1930s, the Fourth Department was probably 
primarily interested in the United States as a base from 
which to collect intelligence on Germany and Japan. 
Mitrokhin did not have access to Fourth Department files 
on its American agents and did not note references to 
these agents in KGB files. The case against Hiss, which 
has been strong but controversial ever since his conviction 
for perjury in 1951, is now overwhelming as a result of 
new evidence revealed during the 1990s from the 
VENONA decrypts, KGB files made available to 
Weinstein and Vassiliev which refer to his work for 
military intelligence, and Hungarian interrogation records 
of Hiss’s fellow agent Noel Field. These sources also do 
much to vindicate the credibility of Hiss’s principal public 
accuser, the former Fourth Department courier Whittaker 
Chambers. The best accounts of the Hiss case are the 
1997 updated edition of Weinstein, Perjury, and 
Weinstein and Vassiliev, The Haunted Wood, chs. 2, 12.

15. vol. 6, ch. 5, part 2. Significantly, material on 



Morozov’s denunciation of two successive residents was 
among that excluded from the documents selected by the 
SVR for the recent study of Soviet espionage in the 
United States in the Stalin era by Weinstein and Vassiliev, 
The Haunted Wood. While obliged to acknowledge the 
purge of many loyal foreign intelligence officers, the SVR 
is generally reluctant to reveal cases where they were 
denounced by their own comrades. Despite such examples 
of SVR censorship, for which Weinstein and Vassiliev are 
not, of course, responsible. The Haunted Wood is a very 
valuable contribution to the history of Soviet intelligence 
operations. 

16. It is unclear from Mitrokhin’s notes whether or not 
Akhmerov was given charge of an independent illegal 
residency before Bazarov’s recall. However, Hede 
Massing’ s memoirs strongly suggest that both Bazarov 
and Akhmerov were members of the same illegal 
residency until at least 1937. Massing, This Deception, 
pp. 187-8, 191. 

17. vol. 6, ch. 3, part 1. Significantly, the list of names 
noted by Mitrokhin did not include Samuel Dickstein, a 
Democratic congressman from Manhattan (codenamed 
CROOK), who had volunteered his services to the NKVD 
in 1937 but demanded a high price for his intelligence. 
Over the next two years, the NKVD oscillated between 
pride at having an agent in Congress and suspicion that 
Dickstein was recycling publicly available information. In 
June 1939 Ovakimyan denounced him in a message to the 



Center as “a complete racketeer and blackmailer.”

19. MORIS is described in Mitrokhin’s note as an 
“archivist” at the Justice Department (vol. 6, ch. 3, part 
1); this may, however, mean simply that he had access to 
department files and archives. 

20. On the careers of Morros (who became an FBI double

William E. Dodd, Jr. (both of whom failed to live up to 
the Centre’s high early expectations), see Weinstein and 
Vassiliev, The Haunted Wood, chs. 3, 6.

history that Akhmerov was recalled in mid- 193 9 is 
difficult to reconcile with Straight’s account of a meeting 
with him in late October. Primakov et al, Ocherki Istorii 
Rossiyskoi Vneshnei Razvedki, vol. 3, ch. 15.

30. vol. 6, ch. 3, part 1. The VENONA decrypts of 
NKVD wartime telegrams from the United States include 
the codenames of approximately 200 agents (about half of 
whom remain unidentified). Since these telegrams 
represent only a fraction of the wartime communications 
between the Center and its American residencies, the total 
NKVD network must have been substantially larger. 
Mitrokhin’s notes give no statistics for the size of the 
network after 1941. The occupational breakdown for the 
network in April 1941 is highly incomplete. Apart from 
the forty-nine “engineers,” Mitrokhin gives the 
occupations of only thirty- six others, of whom twenty-two 
were journalists. Many of the agents were immigrants and 
refugees. In 1940-1, sixty-six Baltic recruits emigrated to 
the United States (vol. 6, ch. 3, part 1).

Niven Wheeler (IZRA). (For examples, see VENONA,

Soviet agents at OSS headquarters were probably well 
into double figures. Communists (not all of them agents)

intelligence officers] would hardly manage to work with 
the same success under the FELLOWCOUNTRYMAN 
[Communist Party] flag. We may possibly set up direct 
liaison with [members of the Silvermaster group], but it is 
doubtful whether we could secure from them the same 
results as ROBERT [Silvermaster], who, constantly 
dealing with them, has many advantages over us.” The

64. vol. 6, ch. 12. Hopkins had been personally briefed by 
Hoover on Zarubin’s visit to Nelson (Benson and Warner 
(eds.), VENONA, document 9). Hoover would doubtless 
have been outraged had he known that Hopkins had 
informed the Soviet embassy. 

65. The source of the information on the talks between 
Roosevelt and Churchill was codenamed “19” — an 
example of the Centre’s confusing habit of sometimes 
recycling the same codename for different people. 
Laurence Duggan had formerly been codenamed “19,” 
but by now had the codename FRANK; he cannot, in any 
case, have provided this information. A detailed, 
meticulous and persuasive study by Eduard Mark 
concludes that it is “probable virtually to the point of 
certainty that Hopkins was 79.” Mark, “Venona’s Source 
19 and the ‘Trident’ Conference of 1943.”

67. Hopkin’s efforts to avoid US-Soviet friction also 
included securing the removal of officials he judged to be 
anti-Soviet: among them the US ambassador in Moscow, 
Laurence A. Steinhardt; the military attache, Major Ivan 
D. Yeaton; and Loy W. Henderson, head of the Soviet 
desk in the State Department. When Soviet foreign 
minister Molotov visited Washington in May 1942, 
Hopkins took him aside and told him what to say to 
persuade Roosevelt of the need for an early second front 
in order to contradict contrary advice from the American 
military. Andrew and Gordievsky, KGB, pp. 297-300,

other KGB documents on atomic espionage, in Voprossi

documents are reprinted in Sudoplatovs, Special Tasks,

81. According to the minutes of the Scientific Advisory 
Committee, Caimcross briefly served as its joint 
secretary; SAC (DP)(41), CAB 90/8, PRO. In his 
memorably mendacious memoirs, Caimcross denied that 
he ever held this post. Even if he is correct in this instance 
(and Whitehall committee secretaries were, almost 
invariably, capable of ensuring that their names were 
correctly recorded), this would not have affected his 
access to SAC minutes since, by his own admission, he 
“had no difficulty in having access to the secret papers in 
Hankey’s office.” Caimcross, The Enigma Spy, pp. 9-10, 
88-92. 

82. The revelation that Caimcross, thanks to his access to 
Scientific Advisory Committee papers, was the first to 
warn the Center of the plan to constmct the atomic bomb 
first appeared in 1990 in Andrew and Gordievsky, KGB, 



p. 321. Probably because Caimcross was then still alive, a 
series of KGB/SVR-sponsored publications suggested 
that the report of the Scientific Advisory Committee had 
come instead from Maclean. (See, e.g., Costello and 
TsdiYQY, Deadly Illusions, p. 218; Samolis (ed.), Veterany 
Vneshnei Razvedki Rossii, pp. 31, 60.) Following 
confirmation by Yuri Modin, who was given 
responsibility for Caimcross ’s file in 1944 and became his 
controller in 1947, that the Scientific Advisory Committee 
report came from Caimcross, the SVR changed its tune. 
In 1998 it released documents from Caimcross ’s file 
proving that he supplied the report and giving further 
details of his role as the first of the atom spies. West and 
Tsarev, The Crown Jewels, pp. 228-9, 234; Michael

85. vol. 6, ch. 6. Roosevelt and Churchill agreed verbally 
on unrestricted exchange of information on the atomic 
project, but did not commit the agreement to writing. The 
Americans in charge of the MANHATTAN project 
afterwards claimed to be ignorant of the agreement. Not 



till the Quebec agreement of August 1943 was “full and 
effective collaboration” between Britain and the United 
States agreed in writing.

90. Fuchs preferred meeting in London Underground 
stations. He later complained to Markus Wolf that 
Kremer’s habit of constantly looking over his shoulder to 
see if he was being followed “seemed to attract more 
attention to us than simply getting on with it.” Andrew 
and Gordlevsky, KGB, pp. 322-4; Wolf, Man without a 
Face, p. 230. The best biography of Fuchs is Williams, 
Klaus Fuchs, Atom Spy. 

91. The references to FIR in Mitrokhin’s notes, including 
her involvement with Fuchs, identify her as SONIA (vol. 
7, ch. 14, item 17). She is not to be confused with a 
British NKGB agent also codenamed FIR, an official of 
the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East 
(ECAFE) recruited in China in 1943 (k-24,126).

94. vol. 7, ch. 14, item 17. It is just possible, though not 
probable, that an even stronger candidate for either of 
these titles is identified in files not seen by Mitrokhin. 
Like most, if not all, British agents recruited in the 1930s 



who were still active after the Second World War, 
Norwood had more than one codename in the course of 
her career. Though Mitrokhin’s notes refer to her only as 
HOLA, her codename in 1945, shortly after she returned 
from GRU to NKGB control, was RITA. Extracts from 
KGB files made available by the SVR to Weinstein and 
Vassiliev, though not mentioning Norwood by name, 
identify RITA as an employee of the Non-Ferrous Metals 
[Research] Association (Weinstein and Vassiliev, The 
Haunted Wood, p. 194; cf the reference to RITA in

(1992), no. 3, is reprinted in translation in Sudoplatovs,

importance, however, it was probably addressed, like his 
report of March 7 (also quoted in vol. 6, ch. 6), to Beria.

project. VENONA decrypts, 1st release, pp. 10, 29. 
Weinstein and Vassiliev, The Haunted Wood, pp. 190-1; 
Albright and Kunstel, Bombshell, p. 319. 

107. Suggestions to the contrary derive chiefly from two 
sources: a fabricated version of the career of PERS 
(renamed PERSEUS), apparently devised by the SVR for 
purposes of mystification, perhaps to protect Theodore 
Hall (cf. Albright and Kunstel, Bombshell, p. 271; 
Weinstein and Vassiliev, The Haunted Wood, pp. 190- 
\n.)\ and the fallible memory of Pavel Sudoplatov, far 
less reliable on atomic espionage than on the “special 
actions” to which he devoted most of his career (cf 
Holloway, “Sources for Stalin and the Bomb''). The New 
York residency was dismayed to learn early in 1945 that 
FOGEL/PERS had declined an offer of employment as a 
construction engineer at Los Alamos, probably owing to a 
mixture of family pressures and fear of exposure.

Chapter Eight Victory 


1. As late as 1990 Valentin Falin, head of the 
International Department of the Central Committee, 
which was largely responsible for determining foreign 
intelligence requirements, claimed that intelligence 
reports in 1943 showed that some in Washington as well 
as in London were considering “the possibility of 
terminating the coalition with the Soviet Union and 
reaching an accord with Nazi Germany, or with the Nazi 
Generals, on the question of waging a joint war against 
the Soviet Union”: 

Therefore when we talk about Stalin’s distrust with 
regard to Churchill, at a certain stage towards those 
surrounding Roosevelt, not so much towards 
Roosevelt himself, we should pay attention to the 
fact that he based this mistrust on a very precise 
knowledge of specific facts. 

The “facts” produced by the Center were, in all 
probability, mere conspiracy theories of the kind which, 
in greater or lesser degree, distorted Soviet intelligence 



assessment throughout, and even beyond, the Stalinist era. 
(Interview by Christopher Andrew with Valentin Falin in 
Moscow for BBC2, December 12, 1990.)

5. See above, chapter 7. 

6. Benson and Warner (eds.), VENONA, p. xviii, n. 30 and 
document 10. The authors suggest the author of the letter 
to Hoover “might have been” Mironov. One of the files 
noted by Mitrokhin makes Mironov’s authorship virtually 
certain. While imprisoned by the NKVD in 1945, 
Mironov tried to smuggle to the American embassy in 
Moscow information about the massacre of the Polish 
officer corps similar to that contained in the letter to 
Hoover in 1943 (vol. 5, section 11). A study of the letter 
by Ben Fischer, written without access to Mitrokhin ’s 
notes on KGB files, seeks to make sense of Mironov’s 
bizarre claim that Zarubin and his wife were working for, 
respectively, Japanese and German intelligence, as a way 



“to grab FBI attention” and ensure that Hoover acted 
against them. But Mr. Fischer also acknowledges 
evidence that Mironov “may have been mentally 
disturbed” (Fischer, “ ‘Mr. Guver,’ ” pp. 10-11.). KGB 
files suggest both an obsessional hostility to Zarubin from 
Mironov and a determination that the West should learn 
the truth about the massacre of the Polish officer corps. In 
the letter to Hoover, Mironov claimed that his real name 
was Markov; Mitrokhin’s notes, however, refer to him as 
Mironov. 

7. Zarubin to Center, June 3, 1943: VENONA decrypts, 
2nd release, pp. 157-8. Zarubin moved to Washington

8. Following the corrupt governorships of Huey and Earl 
Long, Sam Jones established a reputation for scrupulous 
honesty. On his term as governor, see Dawson, The 
Louisiana Governors, pp. 255-9. 

9. vol. 6, ch. 5, part 2. The US “military intelligence 
officer” may have had knowledge of the information on 
Zarubin’s involvement in the massacre of Polish officers 
contained in Mironov’s letter to Hoover.

mention of Zarubin’s various misadventures in the United 
States. 



14. vol. 5, sec. 11. Sudoplatov wrongly claims that 
Mironov was simply “hospitalized and discharged from 
the service” on the grounds of schizophrenia; Special

Apresyan’s transfer to San Francisco was not necessarily 
a demotion in view of the forthcoming organizing

agent Harry Dexter White and presided over by the GRU 
agent Alger Hiss.

pen, Mitrokhin also refers to Perlo in this note as PEL. 
VENONA and other sources make clear that PEL (also 
codenamed PAL and ROBERT) was Greg Silvermaster.

(according to Bentley) Currie rushed to deliver his 
warning “sort of out of breath,” is identified by the 
VENONA decrypts as a Soviet agent (codenamed 
ELERON [AILERON]). Currie himself may well be the 
agent codenamed PAGE to whom there are a number of 
references in the decrypts. Though denying that he had 
ever been a Soviet spy, Currie later acknowledged that he 
been entertained at Gorsky’s home. Senior White House 
officials such as Currie were among the very small group 
privy to the highly classified information that OSS had 
obtained a charred NKGB codebook. There is no 
reference to Currie in Mitrokhin’s notes. 

61. The senior FBI agent who took part in the early 
analysis of the VENONA decrypts, Robert Lamphere,

72. vol. 6, ch. 5, part 2. Unsurprisingly, this remarkable 
tale improved with the telling. In some recent Russian 
versions, Mrs. Cohen hid the documents in a box of 
Kleenex. The less elaborate account noted by Mitrokhin 
appears more reliable. He does not, however, identify the 
Los Alamos scientist who supplied the documents.

76. Though Mitrokhin’s notes include references to most 
of the best-known, as well several hitherto-unknown, 
Soviet spies in the wartime United States, all refer to 
NKVD/NKGB agents. There is thus no reference to Hiss, 
who worked for Soviet military intelligence.

footnote to this decrypt, added by NS A in 1969, identifies 
ALES as “probably Alger Hiss.” The corroborative 
evidence now available puts that identification beyond 
reasonable doubt. Of the four Americans (other than US 
embassy staff) who went on to Moscow after Yalta, only 
Hiss fits Gorsky’s description of ALES (Moynihan, 
Secrecy, pp. 146-8). Gordlevsky recalls a lecture in the 
Centre in which Akhmerov referred to his wartime 
contact with Hiss. Hungarian intelligence files on the 
Noel Field case show that Field also identified Hiss as a 
Soviet agent. Whittaker Chambers, the ex-GRU agent 
who exposed Hiss, testified that, as indicated by Gorsky’s 
telegram. Hiss first began supplying intelligence to 
Moscow in 1935. Both Chambers and Bentley, like 
Gorsky, implicated some of Hiss’s family, as well as Hiss 
himself, in Soviet espionage. Further evidence pointing to 



Hiss came from the Soviet defector Igor Guzenko in 
1945. Though the statute of limitations prevented Hiss’s 
prosecution for espionage in 1950, the evidence used to 
convict him of perjury in that year, for lying about 
providing government documents to a Communist 
spyring, remains compelling. See, inter alia: Breindel, 
“Hiss’s Guilt,” New Republic (April 15, 1996); Schmidt, 
“The Hiss Dossier,” New Republic (November 8, 1993); 
Weinstein, Perjury; Andrew and Gordievsky, KGB. 
ALES, in the Cyrillic alphabet, looks like a contraction of 
“Alger Hiss” — one of a number of Soviet codenames at 
this period which contain clues to the identity of the agent 
concerned. 

82. Andrew and Gordievsky, KGB, p. 347. On the basis of 
Akhmerov’s contact with Hiss (very unusual in the case 
of a GRU agent), Andrew and Gordievsky wrongly 
deduced that Hiss was by now an NKGB agent, in 
common with other leading American GRU agents of the 
late 1930s. 

83. vol. 5, sect. 4. Andrew and Gordievsky, KGB, pp.

Tolstoy, Stalin's Secret War, ch. 17; Knight, “Harold 
Macmillan and the Cossacks”; Mitchell, The Cost of a 
Reputation, chs. 1, 3, 5. Tolstoy provides the most 
detailed and moving description of the forced repatriation 



of the Cossacks, but, as Knight demonstrates, exaggerates 
the personal responsibility of Harold Macmillan, minister- 
resident in Italy and political adviser to Supreme Allied 
Commander Field Marshal Alexander. Mitchell also 
concludes that Macmillan’s “responsibility for what 
ultimately occurred must be adjudged as small.” Tolstoy’s 
charge that Lord Aldington (formerly Brigadier Toby 
Low) had committed war crimes in connection with the 
repatriation led to the award to Lord Aldington in 1989 of 
1.5 million pounds damages for libel. 

85. The fourth White general on Smersh’s “most wanted” 
list, Timofei Domanov, was a former Soviet citizen whose 
fate, unlike that of the other three, had been sealed at 
Yalta.

the name of the lieutenant-colonel, vol. 5, sect. 4, para. 5. 
The memoirs of the Deputy Chief of the Red Army, 
General Sergei Matveyevich Shtemenko, make no 
reference to bribery but confirm part of the sequence of 
events in the KGB files: “The Soviet government then 
made a firm representation to our allies over the matter of 
Krasnov, Shkuro, Sultan Ghirey, and other war criminals. 



The British stalled briefly; but since neither the old White 
guard generals nor their troops were worth much, they put 
all of them into trucks and delivered them into the hands 
of the Soviet authorities” (Tolstoy, Stalin 's Secret War, p. 
298). 

89. Alexander instructed on May 22, 1945, “All who are 
Soviet citizens and who can be handed over to Russians 
without use of force should be returned by 8th Army. Any 
others should be evacuated to 12th Army Group.” It has 
been argued that 5 Corps, the section of the Eighth Army 
which handed over the Cossacks, subsequently concluded 
that it had none the less been given “freedom of action” to 
use force if necessary. Controversy continues. Mitchell, 
The Cost of a Reputation, pp. 49-54. Brigadier Low left 
for Britain on May 22 or 23, some days before the 
“repatriation” began. There is no suggestion that, if 
bribery occurred, he was in any way cognizant of it.

Caimcross’s memoirs are as unreliable about his post-war 
career as about his earlier work as a Soviet agent. He 
claims that he had virtually no access to secret material in 
the Treasury {The Enigma Spy, pp. 124-7). According to 
Robinson, though, “That is totally untrue. The TUBE 
ALLOYS [nuclear weapons] files themselves were many 
inches thick, let alone all the other Secret and Top Secret 
files.”

cite information from “confidential sources” that Hall had 
four or five meetings in New York with a Soviet agent 
whom he knew as “Jimmy Stevens” in 1952-3, before 
finally breaking contact with Soviet intelligence 
{Bombshell, ch. 25). Hall acknowledges that he had

Murphy, head of the CIA Berlin station, 1959-61; Sergei 
Kondrashev, former deputy head of the FCD; George 
Bailey, former Director of Radio Liberty) a substantial 
number of files on KGB operations in Berlin before the 
building of the Wall. Its statement that no Kopatzky file 
exists — rightly dismissed by the authors as “obviously 
disingenuous” — is thus all the more extraordinary. The 
SVR claims that its only record of Kopatzky concerns his 
visit, under his new name Orlov, to the Soviet embassy in 
Washington in 1965 when he inquired about possible 
asylum in the USSR and complained that the FBI was 
“attempting to obtain an admission that he collaborated 
with Soviet intelligence while he was in Germany during 
the 1940s and 1950s.”

116. Though six telegrams in 1945 referred to Philby 
under the codename STANLEY, they appear not to have 
been decrypted until some years later; VENONA 
decrypts, 5th release, part 1, pp. 263-7, 272, 275-6. A 
total of thirty telegrams exchanged between the Centre 
and the London residency, mostly in 1945, were 
eventually decrypted in whole or in part by Anglo- 
American codebreakers.

118. Fuchs told his interrogator that his last contact with 
Soviet intelligence had been in February or March 1949. 



That may have been his last meeting with his controller.

notes whether Philby refused contact with the legal 
residencies from the moment of his arrival in the United 
States in 1949 or in the following year. Unsurprisingly, 
Philby made no mention in his memoirs or published 
interviews of the failings of the American residencies.

the escapades which led to Burgess’s recall were pre-

were much in line with similar, unpremeditated “scrapes” 
over the previous few years.

unaware that Colville had recorded his 1939 meetings 
with Caimcross in his diary, and is wrongly skeptical of 
his ability to identify Caimcross as the author of a note 
describing one of those meetings, found in Burgess’s flat.

Chapter Ten The Main Adversary Part I 


1. 1-7,12; k-13,267; vol. 6, ch. 5, part 1. Mitrokhin’s notes 
omit to record Grigulevich’s alias as a Costa Rican 
diplomat, but the other details he provides (for example, 
the fact that on May 14, 1952 Grigulevich presented his 
letters of credence as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister 
Plenipotentiary of Costa Rica in Rome to the Italian 
president, Luigi Einaudi) clearly identify Grigulevich as 
“Teodoro B. Castro.” The members of the Costa Rican 
delegation to the Sixth Session of the UN General 
Assembly are listed in United Nations, Official Records oj 
the General Assembly Sixth Session, Plenary Meetings, p. 
xiv. 

2. See above, chapter 6. 

3. k-13,370. 

4. k-13,267; k-26,194. The two other leading members of 
the Costa Rican delegation to Rome were Francisco 
Orlich, Minister of Public Works, and Daniel Oduber, 
ambassador in Paris (later president of Costa Rica from 
1974 to 1978, and in 1980 deputy chairman of the 
Socialist International). Grigulevich appears to have won 
their confidence, too; his wife was received by them when 



she visited Costa Rica in 1952. On Figueres’s role in 
restoring constitutional government in Costa Rica, see

10. The VENONA decrypts led to very few arrests of 
Soviet spies, largely because SIGINT was considered too 
secret to be used in court, even in closed session. Even 
had it been used, it would have been open to a variety of 
legal challenges.

“documentation agents” in Austria, 24 in East Germany, 
24 in West Germany, 15 in France, 13 in the United 
States, 12 in Britain, 12 in Italy, 10 in Canada, 10 in 
Belgium, 9 in Mexico, 8 in Iran, 6 in Lebanon and 6 in 
Turkey (vol. 6, ch. 5, part 4). The large number of agents 
in Germany and Austria reflected the high proportion of 
Soviet illegals posing as refugees from East Germany. 

15. Operations officers specializing in illegal 



documentation were posted to the legal residencies in 
New York, Washington, Ottawa, Mexico City, Buenos 
Aires, London, Paris, Rome, Brussels, The Hague, 
Copenhagen, Oslo, Stockholm, Helsinki, Vienna, Athens, 
Istanbul, Tehran, Beirut, Calcutta, Karachi and Cairo.

fifteen years’ imprisonment (five in solitary confinement, 
three in a normal prison cell and seven in labor camp), 
and was later exfiltrated to the West by SIS. He now lives 
in Canada. 

46. vol. 8, ch. 8, para. 20. In January 1964 a KGB officer 
traveling to Winnipeg with a scientific and cultural 
delegation and the Igor Moiseyev Folk Dance Group tried 
to reestablish contact with Morrison, but without success. 
An investigation by agent ANTHEA then established that 
he had moved house. The Centre later planned to involve 
Morrison in the hunt for two illegals, Yevgeni Runge 



(MAKS) and Valentina Rush (ZINA), who defected to the 
CIA in Berlin in 1967. But though attempts by the Ottawa 
residency to locate Morrison continued intermittently 
until 1974 they were unsuccessful (vol. 6, ch. 5, part 5; 
vol. 8, ch. 8, para. 21). In May 1986 Morrison was 
sentenced to eighteen months in jail for offenses against 
the Official Secrets Act (Granatstein and Stafford, Spy 
Wars, p. 149).

assistance of cipher material given by VIK to the FBI and 
other material discovered by the Bureau in MARK’S flat 
after his arrest. Lamphere, The FBI-KGB War, pp. 270-1, 
274-5. 

53. k-3,80; k-8,83. ORIZO’s main motivation seems to 
have been financial. In Paris, he had been paid 40,000 
francs a month; Mitrokhin’s notes do not indicate how 
much he was paid in New York. 

54. k-8,91. 

55. k-3,80. ORIZO continued work as a Soviet agent until 



1980. 

56. Bemikow, v4Z?e4 pp. 171-2. 

57. Bemikow, Abel, chs. 3-4. Even after his arrest, 
MARK failed to realize that VIK had never been under 
surveillance by the FBI. He told his lawyer that “he now 
believed that Hayhanen had been secretly apprehended in 
December [1956] by the FBI and had met [him] thereafter 
on orders from Federal agents” (Donovan, Strangers on a 
Bridge, p. 39).

74. While in New York “Abel” had sent to Moscow, at

Though this was not a very demanding assignment in the 
United States, similar maps were unobtainable for Soviet 
cities.

1963 Victor Norris Hamilton, a former employee of NSA

Illness, defected to the Soviet Union and gave a press

3 1 . The source of the alarmist KGB report of Pentagon 
plans for a nuclear attack was “a document sent by a[n 
unidentified] liaison officer with the CIA to his own 
government” (Fursenko and Naftali, ‘‘One Hell of a 
Gamble,'' pp. 51-2). Though General Curtis LeMay, the 
belligerent head of Strategic Air Command, privately 
used the language of the pre-emptive strike, this never had 
any prospect of becoming the policy of the Eisenhower 
administration. Such language, however, caused some 
concern among the United States’ NATO allies. The 
British JIC, though believing it “highly unlikely that, with 
her democratic method of government and her close ties 
with other Western nations, [the USA] would ever 
provoke a war,” concluded in 1954 that it was “just 
possible that given (a) a more extreme government in the 
US, (b) increased US lack of confidence in some or all of 
her Western allies owing to political development in their 



countries, (c) some sudden advance in the USA in the 
sphere of weapons, etc., the counsels of impatience might 
get the upper hand.” JIC(54) 37 (I owe this information to 
Alex Craig of Christ’s College, Cambridge, currently 
completing a groundbreaking PhD on the JIC in the early 
Cold War). 

Recently declassified US documents indicate that, 
under specified emergency conditions, senior American 
commanders had “predelegated” presidential authority to 
use nuclear weapons (Paul Lashmar, “Dr. Strangelove’s 
Secrets,” Independent, September 8, 1998). It is possible, 
but by no means certain, that a report of this from the 
KGB’s source, together with LeMay’s apocalyptic 
rhetoric, fueled the Centre’s fear of an American first 
strike.

had two, now celebrated, meetings with the ABC 
diplomatic correspondent, John Scali, whom he knew had 
good access to the White House, to discuss ways to end 
the crisis. Kennedy was convinced that Feklisov spoke for 
Khrushchev personally. The KGB archives, however, 
show that he did not. Feklisov played no role either in 
Khrushchev’s proposal on October 26 to resolve the crisis 
by an American guarantee of Cuban territorial integrity, 
or in his attempt on October 27 to trade US bases in 
Turkey for Soviet missile sites in Cuba. It is possible that 
Shelepin, who — ^unlike Semichastny — ^was a member of 
the Presidium, had encouraged Semichastny to use a 
meeting between Feklisov and Scali to try to extract a US 
proposal to settle the crisis which would make the Soviet 
climbdown less humiliating. Because of the incomplete 
nature of KGB files on this episode, together with the 
conflict of oral evidence between Feklisov, Scali and 
Semichastny, it may never be possible to establish what 
led up to the meeting on the Soviet side. Fursenko and

75, apart from North America, were the major states of 
western Europe, China and the Middle East. With the 
exception of the United States, where it was intended to 
establish ten residencies, no state was to have more than 
two.

2. See below, chapter 15. 

3. Dobrynin, In Confidence, pp. 209-10, 513. According 
to Dobrynin, “Andropov was cautious enough not to 
interfere in Gromyko’s everyday management of foreign 
policy, and Gromyko for his part respected Andropov’s 
growing influence in the Politburo.”

12. Kalugin, Spymaster, p. 83. Kalugin does not give 
Lipka’s name or codename and refers to him only as “a 
‘walk-in’ who came to us in the mid-1960s, explaining 
that he was involved in shredding and destroying NS A 
documents.” A later analysis by the Centre singled out 
200 documents from NS A, the CIA, State Department and 
other federal agencies as of particular value. Mitrokhin’s 
notes, alas, give no details of their contents. 

13. vol. 6, ch. 11, part 3; vol. 6, app. 1, parts 12, 26, 28, 
41; k-8,78. Lipka’s file includes his and his father’s 
addresses during the 1970s, as well as details of his wife’s 
work at St. Joseph’s Hospital in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, 
together with her telephone number at the hospital.

17. Kalugin, Spymaster, p. 89. The fact that Walker’s file 
was held by the Sixteenth Department, separately from 



most other FCD files, explains why Mitrokhin never saw 
it. There are probably other Sixteenth Department agents 
of whom he was also unaware.

85. Mitrokhin’ s notes give the recruitment dates of fifteen 
S&T agents who began work for the KGB in the 1970s: 
ANTON (1975), ARAM (1975), CHEKHOV/YAYKAL 
(1976), MAG (1974), MIKE (1973), OTPRYSK (1974), 
SARKIS (1974), SATURN (1978), SOFT (1971), TROP 
(1979), TURIST (1977), UGNYUS (1974), ZENIT 
(1978) and two others whose codenames cannot be 
published (recruited in 1975-6). VIE appears to have been 
recruited earlier. Other S&T agents active in the USA 
during the 1970s, whose recruitment dates do not appear 
in Mitrokhin’ s notes, were LONG, PATRIOT and 
RIDEL. Mitrokhin also identifies five trusted contacts 
recruited during the 1970s: KLARA (1972), KURT 
(1973), TSORN (1977), VELLO (1973) and VEYT 
(1973). In the case of a further eight members of the S&T 
network in 1970s (FOGLE, FREY, IZOLDA, OZON, 
ROZHEK, SPRINTER, TEP-LOTEKNIK and VAYS), it 
is unclear from Mitrokhin ’s notes which were fiilly 
recruited agents and which were trusted contacts. The 
notes give no dates for the activities of another eight S&T 
agents and trusted contacts probably active in the 1970s: 
ALGORITMAS, AUTOMOBILIST, CHARLES, KLIM, 
LIR, ODISSEY, PAVEL and RUTH. Mitrokhin’ s notes 
on all those listed above are relatively brief, varying in 



length from a few lines to a paragraph. A majority of both 
agents and trusted contacts are identified by name. vol. 6, 
app. 1, parts 1, 2, 3, 5, 11, 14, 20, 27, 28, 29, 31, 32, 38,

2,109,161-2; t-7,77. 

86. FREY was an agent and PAVEL a trusted contact in 
IBM (vol. 6, app. 1, parts 5, 27). Agent SATURN 
occupied a senior scientific post in McDonnell Douglas 
(vol. 6, app. 1, parts 27, 32). Agent ZENIT was a scientist 
in TRW (vol. 6, app. 1, part 27).

91. The latest date for which Mitrokhin provides statistics 
on the total numbers of S&T agents run by the New York 
and Washington residencies is 1970; he provides no 
statistics on the agents run by the San Francisco 
residency. 

92. Lindsey, The Falcon and the Snowman. Boyce 
escaped from prison in 1980, but was recaptured a year 
later and sentenced to an additional three years for 
escaping and twenty-five years for robbing seventeen 
banks while on the run (Lindsey, The Flight of the 
Falcon). 



93. vol. 6, app. 1, part 27. Mitrokhin’s brief note on 
ZENIT ’s recruitment gives no details of the intelligence 
he supplied. Other important intelligence on satellite 
surveillance included the operating manual for KH-1 1, the 
most advanced US SIGINT satellite. Early in 1978 
William Kampiles, who had been briefly employed by the 
CIA Watch Center, presented a copy of it to the KGB 
residency in Athens. He was unaware, however, that the 
KGB officer who received it, Sergei Ivanovich Bokhan, 
had been recruited several years earlier by the CIA.

estimated saving in imports paid for in hard currency. 
Brezhnev was informed that the economic benefit of S&T 
for the Soviet defense industry had not been calculated,

13. The best and fullest account of Oswald’s period in the 
Soviet Union is in Mailer, Oswald's Tale. Mailer had 



access to many of the voluminous KGB files on Oswald, 
which include transcripts of conversations in his bugged 
flat in Minsk and surveillance reports from KGB 
personnel who followed him wherever he went, even 
spying on him and his wife through a peephole in the 
bedroom wall to record their “intimate moments.” 

14. Childs’s warning about Oswald’s letter was cited in a 
report by KGB chairman Semichastny to the Central 
Committee on December 10, 1963, of which an extract 
appears in Yeltsin, The View from the Kremlin, appendix 
B, p. 307. Yeltsin identifies the CPUSA informant as 
“Brooks,” but does not reveal that this was the CPUSA 
alias of Jack Childs. For the text of Oswald’s letter to the 
CPUSA of August 28, 1963, see Mailer, Oswald’s Tale, 
pp. 594-5. 

15. Posner, Case Closed, disposes of many of the 
conspiracy theories. Norman Mailer, the author of the 
best-documented study of Oswald, admits that he “began 
with a prejudice in favor of the conspiracy theorists” but 
finally concluded both that Oswald “had the character to 
kill Kennedy, and that he probably did it alone.” The most 
difficult unsolved question is not whether Oswald shot the 
President but why he did so. Oswald was both a self- 
obsessed fantasist and a compulsive liar. There is general 
agreement, however, that he had no personal hostility to 
Kennedy himself The best clue to Oswald’s motives is 
probably that provided by the Intourist guide who first 
introduced him to Russia. “The most important thing for 



[Oswald],” she recalls, “was that he wanted to become 
famous. Idea Number One. He was fanatic about it” 
(Mailer, Oswald's Tale, p. 321). In Dallas on November 
22, 1963 Oswald seized the opportunity to become one of 
the best-known Americans of the twentieth century. 

16. Marzani was bom in Rome in 1912 and emigrated 
with his parents to the United States in 1923. After 
graduating from Williams College, Mass., in 1935, he 
worked for a year in publishing, then studied at Exeter 
College, Oxford, from 1936 to 1938. According to his 
KGB file, while at Oxford University (perhaps during the 
1937 long vacation) he served in an anarchist brigade in 
the Spanish Civil War, then joined the Communist Party. 
On his return to the United States (probably in 1938), he 
became a member of the CPUS A, using the Party alias 
“Tony Wells.” In 1942 Marzani joined the Office of the 
Co-ordinator of Information (shortly to become OSS, 
which contained a number of other Communists and 
Soviet agents). When OSS was closed in September 1945, 
Marzani ’s section was transferred to the State 
Department. According to his KGB file, Marzani was first 
recommended to the New York residency by its agent, 
Cedric Belfrage (CHARLIE), who during the Second 
World War worked for British Security Co-ordination in 
New York (vol. 6, ch. 14, part 2). On his transfer to the 
State Department, Marzani signed a sworn statement that 
he did not belong to, or support, “any political party or 
organization that advocates the overthrow of the 



Government by force or violence.” When later discovered 
to be a member of the CPUS A (officially considered to 
advocate that policy), he was sentenced in 1948 to two 
and a half years’ imprisonment. Marzani gave some 
details of his pre-war and wartime career in testimony to 
the Senate Subcommittee to Investigate the 
Administration of the Internal Security Act and Other 
Internal Security Laws on June 18, 1953, but cited the 
Fifth Amendment and declined to answer the main 
questions put to him.

19. The total advertising budget funded by the KGB 
during the seven-year period 1961-8 was 70,820 dollars, 
vol. 6, ch. 14, parts 1,2. 

20. Kalugin, Spy mas ter, p. 45. Marzani published over 
twenty books and pamphlets, written either by himself or 
by authors he had selected, on subjects chosen by the 
KGB. Several concerned the Vietnam War. Other active 
measures organized by Marzani included an attempt to 
discredit Stalin’s daughter, Svetlana Alliluyeva 
(codenamed KUKUSHKA), after her flight to the United 
States in 1967. The KGB helped to refinance Marzani ’s 
publishing house after it was seriously damaged in a fire 
in 1969. During the early 1970s, however, the KGB 
became increasingly dissatisfied with Marzani. According 
to Mitrokhin’s later notes on his file: 



The [New York] Residency began to notice signs of 
independent behavior on the part of NORD. He 
began to overestimate the extent to which the 
Residency depended upon him, and deluded himself 
in thinking that he was the only person in the country 
capable of carrying out Soviet intelligence tasks. 

Since 1974 NORD has been living in Puerto Rico; 
it has been difficult to communicate with him there, 
and he lost many intelligence opportunities.

23. Joesten, Oswald, pp. 143, 145. In the second edition, 
Joesten acknowledged “substantial aid” from Marzani in 
the “research and writing” of an appendix criticizing the 
Warren report (Joesten, Oswald, p. 159^.). 

24. Even the sympathetic Mark Lane later wrote 
somewhat critically of Joesten’ s book: “I had met with 
Carl Marzani, read proofs of the book at his request, and 
made some few suggestions. It was a very early work, 
written before the Warren Commission’s evidence was 
released; therefore, while timely, it was of necessity 
somewhat flawed and incomplete” (Lane, Plausible 
Denial, p. 44^).

39. Andrew, For the President's Eyes Only, pp. 31 1-12. 

40. Also influential was the report of the House Select 
Committee on the JFK and King assassinations. Its draft 



report in December 1978 concluded that Oswald acted 
alone. Flawed acoustic evidence then persuaded the 
committee that, in addition to the three shots fired by 
Oswald, a fourth had been fired from a grassy knoll, thus 
leading it to conclude in its final report of July 1979 that 
there had been a conspiracy. It pointed to mobsters as the 
most likely conspirators. Posner, Case Closed, pp. 475- 
86, appendix A. 

41. Andrew, For the President's Eyes Only, pp. 401-7, 
410-11, 421. In private Church later admitted that his 
study of CIA assassination plots convinced him that the 
real rogue elephants had been in the White House: “The 
CIA operated as an arm of the presidency. This led 
presidents to conclude that they were ‘super-godfathers’ 
with enforcers. It made them feel above the law and 
unaccountable.”

53. The defense committee also took up the case of an 
American journalist, Mark Hosenball, who had also been 
served with a deportation order. Unlike Agee, however, 
Hosenball had no contact with the committee and took no 
part in its campaign. In the KGB files noted by Mitrokhin 
there is no mention of Hosenball, save for a passing 
reference to the work of the defense committee.

56. At a private meeting of the Parliamentary Labour 
Party on February 17, 1977, however, the Home 
Secretary, Merlyn Rees, implied a KGB connection. Tony 
Bonn’s diary vaguely records that the gist of Rees’s 
comments was that Agee and Hosenball “had been in 
contact or whatever with enemy agents or something.”

to propagate the old JFK conspiracy theories is Oleg 
Nechiporenko, who twice met Oswald in Mexico City in 
October 1963 and was later concerned with active 



measures involving Philip Agee. After his official 
retirement from the KGB in 1991, Nechiporenko made a 
number of appearances on the American lecture circuit, 
published his memoirs in English and was interviewed by 
Dan Rather in a CBS special on the JFK assassination. 
Nechiporenko, however, has become confused by the 
distinction between the original version of the KGB 
conspiracy theory of the assassination involving oil 
magnate H. L. Hunt and a later version which targeted 
Watergate conspirator E. Howard Hunt. His book. 
Passport to Assassination, which argues that the 
“billionaire E. Howard Hunt played a special role” in the 
assassination, confuses the two Hunts. Nechiporenko also 
claims that the CIA was probably involved. Passport to 
Assassination, p. 135.

28. Their names are listed in k-20,93,94. 

29. GROMOV was Vasili Antonovich Gordlevsky, who 



at different times assumed the identities of Kurt Sandler, 
Kurt Molner and Emil Frank (t-7,279). SADKO was an 
Estonian, Ivan Karlovich lozenson, who posed 
successively as a Canadian of Finnish origins, Valte Urho 
Kataja, and as the Germans Hans Graven and Pobbs 
Friedrich Schilling (vol. 8, ch. 8; k-8,23, 167,574). 
SEVIDOV’s real name is not recorded in Mitrokhin’s 
notes. When traveling in the West, he usually carried a 
West German passport in the name of Heinrich Dremer or 
Kurt Ernst Tile; he also possessed an Austrian passport in 
the name of Dremer. At one stage a Swiss passport was 
also held in reserve for him at the KGB residency in 
Vienna. When traveling in Poland, he posed as the East 
German Willi Werner Neumann (k- 16,455). VLADIMIR 
was a Soviet ethnic German, Ivan Dmitryevich Unrau, 
who obtained his first West German passport under an 
assumed identity in 1961; he used at least two different 
names, Hans Emil Redveyks and [first name unknown] 
Maykhert. His wife Irina Yevseyevna was the illegal 
BERTA (k- 16,61). VLAS was a Soviet Moldavian (real 
name unrecorded) who posed as the West German Rolf 
Max Thiemichen. His wife LIRA was also an illegal (k- 
11,6; k-8,277). The aliases of all five illegals, like others, 
were noted by Mitrokhin in the Cyrillic alphabet; their 
retranslation into the Roman alphabet may in some 
instances produce spelling errors. 

30. GURYEV was Valentin Aleksandrovich Gutin, who 
posed in Czechoslovakia as a businessman (alias not 



recorded), probably from West Germany; he accompanied 
GROMOV to Prague (k-19,655). YEVDOKIMOV’S real 
name is not recorded; he used the alias Heinz Bayer (k- 
20,94; t-2,65). 

31. The first list of illegals selected for postings in 
Czechoslovakia contains the name of PYOTR, also 
known as ARTYOM. Later records reveal that his wife 
ARTYOMOVA, also an illegal, played an active role in 
Czechoslovakia, but Mitrokhin’s notes contain no 
reference to operations by PYOTR/ ARTYOM. 
ARTYOMOVA was a MGIMO graduate (real name 
unknown) who held a West German passport in the name 
of Edith Ingrid Eichendorf, but posed in Czechoslovakia 
as an Austrian businesswoman (alias unknown) (k-8,44; 
k-20,176). DIM (or DIMA) was V. I. Lyamin; he traveled 
to Prague on an Austrian passport (alias not recorded) 
(vol. 5, sec. 14; k-20,85). VIKTOR was a Latvian, Pavel 
Aleksandrovich Karalyun, who obtained a Brazilian 
passport in 1959 and later assumed Austrian nationality 
(vol. 6, ch. 5, parts 2, 4; k- 16,483). 

32. Mitrokhin notes that BELYAKOV used British 
identity documents but does not record either his real or 
his assumed name (vol. 6, ch. 5, part 4). USKOV was 
[first name not recorded] Nikolayevich Ustimenko, who 
used successively Irish and British passports (aliases not 
recorded). VALYA was USKOV’ s Norwegian-bom wife, 
Victoria Martynova, who took Soviet citizenship on her 
marriage in 1961; like her husband, she used a British 



passport in Czechoslovakia (vol. 7, ch. 7; k-20,190). 

33. ALLA was Galina Leonidovna Vinogradova (later 
Linitskaya and Kaminskaya), a Yugoslav woman whose 
first marriage was to a GRU illegal, Vladimir Ivanovich 
Vinogradov. In 1954 she obtained an Austrian passport in 
the name of Maria Machek. After her husband was 
dismissed from the GRU on charges of “political 
immaturity and ideological instability” in 1955, ALLA 
married the KGB illegal INDOR, then operating in 
Switzerland as Waldemar Weber, and acquired Swiss 
citizenship as Maria Weber. Her marriage to INDOR was 
dissolved “for operational reasons” in 1957 and she began 
a relationship with an Egyptian (codenamed PHARAOH) 
whom she met in Switzerland. Mitrokhin’s notes on 
ALLA’s bulky file record that she operated in 
Czechoslovakia in 1968 as Maria Werner. It is unclear 
whether ALLA had actually changed her alias from 
Weber or whether the apparent change is due to a clerical 
error related to the transliteration of her pseudonym to and 
from the Cyrillic alphabet, vol. 4, indapp. 3; vol. 4, 
pakapp. 3; k-20,187. 

34. SEP was Mikhail Vladimirovich Fyodorov. From 
1945 to 1951 he worked in Polish military intelligence 
under the alias Mikhail Lipsinski. In 1952 he and his wife 
ZHANNA (also an illegal) obtained Swiss passports. 
From 1953 to 1968 he was illegal resident in Switzerland; 
Mitrokhin’s notes do not record his alias, k-20,94,201; 
vol. 7, ch. 7; vol. 7, app. 3. 



35. YEFRAT was a Soviet Armenian, Ashot Abgarovich 
Akopyan, who assumed the identity of a living Lebanese 
double, Oganes Saradzhyan, who had migrated to the 
Soviet Union and obtained, successively, French and 
Lebanese passports. His wife, Kira Viktorovna Chertenko 
(TANYA), was also an illegal, k-7,9; k-16,338,419. 

36. ROY (also known as KONEYEV) was Vladimir 
Igorevich Stetsenko, who assumed the identity of a 
Mexican citizen, Felipe Bums, allegedly the son of a 
Canadian father and Mexican mother. His wife PAT (also 
known as IRINA) was also an illegal, vol. 8, app. 3a. 

37. The assumed nationality of the illegal JURGEN is not 
recorded in Mitrokhin’s notes.

August 1968 (k-20,182); most had almost certainly been 
on previous short-term missions during the Prague Spring. 
The total sent, usually on more than one mission, to 
Czechoslovakia in 1968-9 was twenty-nine (k-20,203).

1939 she moved to Russia, took Soviet citizenship and 
joined the NKGB in 1941. She worked as an illegal in 
France (1946-52) and Mexico (1954-57) before moving to 
Montreal in 1958. Despite her criticisms, ERNA told her 
shocked comrades in Budapest that she remained a 
committed Leninist. By the mid-1970s, however, she had 
become so disillusioned that she broke contact with the 
KGB.

15. The KGB liaison office report cited as an example of 
the full and frank intelligence provided by Kaska the fact 
that he “told us all that he knew about Indra’s behavior in

19. Indra was seen by Husak as a potential rival, and his 
move in 1971 from his position as Party secretary to the 
prestigious but not very influential post of chairman of the 
National Assembly was probably intended to curtail his 
influence within the CPCz. Renner, A History oj

V. A. Pakhomov of the Second Chief Directorate, and 
“others from the KGB Investigation Department.” During

photographer with “contacts in the Party and state 
apparatus” (k- 19,4 15). The contact established by 
BOGUN with Bardecki was later continued by the illegal 



FILOSOV. Like others targeted by PROGRESS 
operations, Bardecki cannot be blamed for speaking to 
Western visitors whom he had no means of identifying as 
KGB illegals.

Stasi personnel as “over 60,000” (k- 19,271). This is 
consistent with documents in the Gauck [Stasi] Archive,

8. Mitrokhin’s notes do not include any examples of the 
intelligence obtained by DARIO and his female recruits 
from the foreign ministry. 

9. At various stages in his career as a Soviet agent, 
DARIO was codenamed BASK, SPARTAK, GAU, 
CHESTNY and GAUDEMUS. He appears to have 



switched from GRU to MGB control immediately after 
the Second World War. k-10,109. 

10. k-1 0,1 01-3, 107, 109. Mitrokhin’s notes imply that in 
1956 DARIO was also instrumental in the recruitment of 
MAGDA, a typist in the foreign ministry press 
department (k-1 0,1 00, 103). Mitrokhin’s notes also record 
the recruitment in 1970 of an agent in the Foreign 
Ministry, codenamed STRELOK, by Georgi Pavlovich 
Antonov. STRELOK subsequently became “reluctant to 
cooperate” (k-4,80,158; k-2,22 1,23 1,268).

24. Mitrokhin’s notes unfortunately contain nothing on 



the Communist role in the post-war coalition governments 
and little on Finland before the Brezhnev era. Given the 
willing assistance given to the KGB by the SVK chairman 
(later honorary chairman), Ville Pessi, in the 1970s (k- 
26,191,211,228), it is scarcely conceivable that such 
assistance was not forthcoming earlier. Pessi was already 
a powerful figure as SVK secretary after the Second 
World War. The earliest post-war example of SVK 
assistance to Soviet intelligence operations noted by 
Mitrokhin was the help given in 1949-51 to the illegal 
VIK in adopting the identity of the Finn Eugene Maki. 
The first KGB agent in the Finnish police force referred to 
in Mitrokhin’ s notes is ZVEN, a CID officer recruited in 
1959 (k-5,309).

31. Mitrokhin’ s notes give the names of two Canadians 



who assisted in obtaining the passport in the name of 
“Robert Callan,” no. 4-716255. The Centre also doctored 
a genuine Canadian passport, no. 4-428012, in the name 
of Vasili Dzogola (?Dzogol), inserting a photograph of 
“Abel” and changing the eye color and other particulars to 
match his. Because of “Abel’s” arrest, this passport too 
was never used. vol. 6, ch. 5, part 2. 

32. k-27,451. 

33. k-3,122. 

34. Since non- Soviet citizens could not normally qualify 
for officer status in the KGB, it was intended that the new

officers.

40. vol. 8, ch. 13. Mitrokhin’s note on the meeting with 
Kashtan does not say explicitly that he was asked to 
talent-spot illegal agents. Given the previous role of the 
CPC in helping to fabricate illegals’ legends, however, it 
is barely conceivable that Kashtan, unlike the other 
Western Communist leaders mentioned in the files noted 
by Mitrokhin, was asked to recommend only conventional 
agents.

1972, entitled “Measures for the Further Activation of 
Illegals Intelligence Activity and Increasing Its Role in 
the Foreign-Political Intelligence System of the KGB 
Under the USSR Council of Ministers,” envisaged the 
recruitment of illegal agents recommended by the 
Communist Parties of the United States, Canada, Mexico, 
Brazil and Argentina for operations in North America; by 
the Communist Parties of Belgium, Britain, France, the 
FRG and Spain for operations in Europe; by the 
Communist Party of Japan for operations in Asia; and by 
the Communist Party of Israel for operations in the 
Middle East. vol. 6, ch. 5, part 4.

46. k-26,108. In Angola, once the richest of Portugal’s 
colonies, the end of Portuguese rule was followed in 1975 
by full-scale civil war between the Marxist Popular 
Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) and the 
rival, non-Marxist FNLA and UNITA. Cunhal also 
promised “to do everything possible to give assistance to 
the MPLA, including using illegal channels to send 
people drawn from among experienced military cadres,” 
though the PCP’s assistance was dwarfed by that from the 
Soviet Union and Cuba, k-26,205,209. 

47. Maxwell, The Making of Portuguese Democracy, pp. 
69-70. According to Maxwell, the PIDE/DGS archives 
also revealed that “the PCP had some embarrassing 



skeletons of its own, not least the secret police informers 
within its own ranks.” 

48. k-26,4. 

49. k-26,4. For examples of PIDE/DGS documents which 
appeared in the press, probably as a result of KGB active 
measures, see Maxwell, The Making of Portuguese 
Democracy, p. 70. Mitrokhin’s notes give no details of 
these active measures. In 1994 the PIDE/DGS archive 
was opened to researchers, subject to a series of 
restrictions, at the Lisbon National Archive.

5 1 . Recruitment leads from the PCP leadership during the 
mid- and late 1970s included: the government lawyers 
BORETS and ZNATOK (k- 16, 180, 182); the trade union 
lawyer ZHAK (k-16,179); MARAT, a registrar of births, 
deaths and marriages who was able to provide 
documentation for illegals (k-1 8,345); KAREKA, a 
newspaper editor used for active measures from 1977 to 
1982 (k-14,272); and EMIL, a journalist with the ANOP 
agency (k- 14,404). Some of the other Portuguese 
cultivations, agents and confidential contacts of which 
details are given in Mitrokhin’s notes probably also 
stemmed from PCP leads. 

52. k-18,345. Cf k-26,210. 

53. Pessi had further discussions on agent recruitment in 
both Moscow and Helsinki during 1978 and 1979; k- 
26,211,228,191. 



54. k-8,79. Mitrokhin identifies the Dublin resident only 
by his codename KAVERIN; his real name (Shadrin) is 
given in Andrew and Gordievsky, KGB, appendix D3. 

55. Andrew and Gordievsky (eds.), Instructions from the 
Centre, pp. 53-6. Kryuchkov’s circular to residencies of 
April 6, 1978 referred to previous circulars of March 28, 
1975 and June 17, 1976, apparently written in similar 
vein. 

56. k-19,7. The main Asian Communist Parties mentioned 
in Mitrokhin ’s notes as taking part in the recruiting drive 
were those of the Indian subcontinent, Afghanistan and 
Japan. KGB relations with Third World Communist 
Parties will be covered in more detail in Volume 2. 

57. It is possible, however, that a latter-day Sorge remains 
concealed in a file not seen by Mitrokhin. It is also 
possible that one or more of the recruits of the 1970s and 
early 1980s developed into an illegal of major importance 
after Mitrokhin ceased to have access to the files. 

58. k-27,99. Mitrokhin’ s notes give Maria’s full name, but 
it seems unfair to identify her. 

59. k-14,519; k-18,409. Mitrokhin’s notes reveal the 
identity of LIMB, DANA and MARCEL. 

60. See below, chapter 18. 

61. The FCD communication to Ponomarev of October 
20, 1980 was numbered 2192-A/OV. The basic subsidy 
paid to Kashtan in the late 1970s was 150,000 US dollars, 
paid in two annual installments, with some supplements. 
By the 1980s the CPC had a membership of only about 



4,000, and was thus receiving a subsidy of about $40 
dollars per member. Subsidies were also paid to the 
Canada-USSR and Quebec-USSR Societies, and to the 
Severny Sosed (“Northern Neighbour”) journal. In 
addition, subsidies were sometimes channeled through the 
CPC to the Haitian Communists, and perhaps other 
Parties, vol. 8, ch. 13. 

62. Haynes and Klehr, “‘Moscow Gold,’ Confirmed at 
Last?” pp. 281-4; L. Dobbs, Down with Big Brother, p. 
414. Mitrokhin’s notes provide numerous examples of 
“Moscow gold,” especially during the 1970s, but no 
figures for the total subsidies received by any Communist 
Party. 

63. Barron, Operation Solo, ch. 4; the aliases of Morris 
Childs (bom Chilovsky) are given in vol. 6, ch. 12. (On 
Child’s earlier career in the CPUS A, see Klehr, Haynes 
and Anderson, The Soviet World of American 
Communism, pp. 257-71.) Barron’s account is based on 
interviews and other material from Childs, his wife Eva 
and FBI agents concerned with his case. Operation Solo 
somewhat exaggerates the importance of the intelligence 
he supplied to the FBI after his trips to Moscow (see 
Draper, “Our Man in Moscow,” New York Review oj 
Books (May 9, 1996)). Mitrokhin’s notes from KGB files, 
however, largely corroborate, as well as making important 
additions to, Barron’s account of Childs’s role in 
channeling Soviet funds to the CPUS A. Mitrokhin, unlike 
Barron, rarely gives annual totals for the Soviet subsidies. 



But those he provides are compatible with, though not 
identical to, Barron’s figures. According to the KGB files 
noted by Mitrokhin, the “allocations” to the CPUS A were 
1.7 million dollars in both 1975 and 1976 (vol. 6, ch. 12). 
Barron gives figures of 1,792,676 dollars for 1975 and 
1,997,651 dollars for 1976 {Operation Solo, appendix B); 
one possible explanation for the discrepancies is that, as 
sometimes happened, additional allocations were made in 
the course of the year.

67. vol. 6, ch. 12. 

68. Barron, Operation Solo, pp. 144-5. Mitrokhin’s notes 
and Barron’s book neatly complement each other. 
Mitrokhin summarizes the account of Friedman’s career 
in KGB files (vol. 6, ch. 12); Barron describes his career 
as known to the FBI, though he omits his real name and 
identifies him only by his FBI codename, CLIP.

76. vol. 6, ch. 12. Instead of Jackson, Dobrynin asked 
Hall to bring with him to meetings at the embassy Arnold 
Johnson, director of the CPUS A Information and Lecture 
Bureau, once improbably eulogized by Lee Harvey 
Oswald as “the Lenin of our country” (Posner, Case 
Closed, p. 149). 

77. DeLoach, Hoover’s FBI, pp. 213-14; Barron, 
Operation Solo, pp. 262-3. FBI reports to the White 
House said that Levison had been identified as a secret 
CPUS A member by “an informant who has furnished 
reliable information in the past as a secret member of the 
Communist Party,” presumably Jack Childs. Friedly and

CPUS A, O’Dell resigned from King’s Southern Christian 
Leadership Conference in 1962. Mitrokhin’s notes 
contain no specific reference to O’Dell but reveal that the 
magazine Freedomways, with which he became actively 
involved after leaving the SCLC, had been founded with 
active Soviet support, continued to receive secret Soviet 
subsidies and was “close” to the CPUS A. vol. 6, ch. 12.

only to reports in FCD files based on intelligence 
provided by the agent, not to the agent’s file itself — 
probably because he had been recruited by the Second 
(rather than the First) Chief Directorate during a visit to 
the Soviet Union. Within the United States he seems to 
have been run from the San Francisco residency.

(codenamed CARO) and Guido Cappelloni (codenamed

Smaller subsidies also went to the Italian Socialist 
Party of Proletarian Unity (PSIUP) and the San Marino 
Communist Party. In 1974 the San Marino general

1973, but it was agreed that, “The two-way radios must be 
handed over to our Italian friends [the PCI] only when 
there is a real need to organize radio communications, 
bearing in mind that if kept in store for a long period the 
radio stations require periodic checks, maintenance and

aligning himself with the PCI’s reformist leadership, 
however, the International Department continued to 
subsidize the PCI old guard until 1987. In 1989 the PCI, 
led since 1988 by Achille Ochetto, changed its name to 
the PDS (Partito Democratico della Sinistra), the 
Democratic Party of the Left. A breakaway movement 
established itself in 1991 as the Partito della Rifondazione 
Comunista.

had worked abroad as an illegal under the name Rudolf 
Steiner in Austria and Latin America. On returning to 
Moscow, apparently unable to stand the strain of life as an 
illegal, he began work in the Novosti Press Agency (k- 
16,446). Though the probability is that Vasilyev was the 
stoolpigeon placed in Sinyavsky’ s cell, it is just possible 
that the KGB used another agent with the same codename 
— though there is no identifiable record of such an agent 
in Mitrokhin’s notes.

recalled to Moscow on the grounds that he was producing 
little intelligence and had greatly overspent his budget 
(vol. 3, pakapp. 3).

the fact that within a few weeks, if not days, Valentina 



Holubova had established herself as his secretary and 
assistant make it probable that she was the caller. It is 
unlikely that a genuine native of Ryazan had tracked him 
down so rapidly. In reality, Holubova came not from 
Ryazan but from Vladivostok (k-2 1,123). 

47. Scammell, Solzhenitsyn, p. 886. The fact that Dr. 
Franti'sek Holub was, like his wife, working for the StB, 
is implied rather than specifically stated in Mitrokhin’s 
notes. For example, he records that the Holubs jointly 
recommended to Solzhenitsyn another StB officer posing 
as a Czech dissident, Tomas Rezac (k-2 1,123). It is 
inconceivable that the StB or the KGB would have 
allowed a husband and wife team to operate in this way 
unless both were working for them.

about political prisoners, we don’t have any ... It is 
common knowledge that [Sakharov] committed actions 
punishable by law ... Measures were taken with regard to 
him according to our legislation. The actual state of 



affairs is as follows. Sakharov resides in Gorky in normal 
conditions, is doing scientific work, and remains a 
member of the USSR Academy of Sciences. He is in 
normal health as far as I know. His wife has recently left 
the country for medical treatment abroad. As for Sakharov 
himself, he is still a bearer of secrets of special 
importance to the state and for this reason cannot go

17. Philby’s career as an SIS officer had ended after his 
recall from Washington in 1951. Philby’s later account to 
Borovik of his years in Beirut contains a number of 
inaccuracies, due partly to his attempt to discredit Lunn 
(transcribed by Borovik as “Lan” — an error derived, as in 
the KGB files noted by Mitrokhin, from the conversion of 
“Lunn” into Cyrillic). Philby attributes his successful 
escape in 1963 largely to Lunn’s incompetence and adds 
that “amazingly, three or four years later [Lunn] received 
a high honour — the Cross of St. Michael and St. George” 
(Borovik, The Philby Files, p. 354). In reality, as Philby 
had correctly informed the KGB after his defection, Lunn 
was awarded the CMG a decade earlier, in 1957 (vol. 7, 



ch. 5). 

18. Lunn was the author of High-Speed Skiing (1935), A 
Skiing Primer (1948) and The Guinness Book of Skiing 
(1983). His father, Sir Arnold Lunn (1888-1974), was one 
of Europe’s leading ski pioneers, as well as a leading 
Catholic apologist and a vocal opponent of both Nazism 
and Communism. His 63 books included 23 on skiing and 
16 on Christian apologetics {Dictionary of National 
Biography, 1971-1980, pp. 522-3). 

19. Lunn’s recent Who's Who entries give the date of his 
entry into SIS. Earlier entries make no reference to his 
intelligence career. 

20. Unless otherwise indicated, the account of operation 
RUBIN is based on k-24,299 and vol. 7, ch. 5.

recovery during the 1970s, see Andrew and Gordlevsky, 
KGB, pp. 24-6, 544-5, and Knightley, Philby, pp. 234-7. 

25. One of the CIA officers on whom intelligence was 
gathered during operation RUBIN was selected by 
Andropov as the target of an attempted abduction. 

26. k- 18,342. 

27. vol. 6, app. 1 (misc.), parts 1, 4; k-27,242. Mitrokhin’ s 
notes give no indication of what intelligence was obtained 
by bugging the CIA officer’s flat. VERA’s file records 



that the KGB lost contact with her in 1975 as a result of 
the Lebanese Civil War.

30. Details of operation REBUS in k- 17,49,59, 185; vol. 6, 
ch. 10. On November 16, 1981 operation PHOENIX 
succeeded in bugging the residence of the US ambassador 
in Conakry. The agent responsible was a Guinean 
(probably a domestic servant) codenamed MURAT (k- 
17,145; k-8,519). The KGB also succeeded in intercepting 
the communications of US embassies in a number of 
other African capitals, among them Bamako and 
Brazzaville (vol. 6, ch. 10; k- 17, 168). 

31. The last, reforming chairman of the KGB, Vadim 
Bakatin, appointed after the failed coup of August 1991, 
outraged his staff by giving the American ambassador 
blueprints of the highly sophisticated bugging system 
(Albats, The State within a State, pp. 311-13). There were 
several security alerts within the existing US embassy in 
Moscow during the 1980s. In 1984, however, bugs were 
discovered in electric typewriters in the US embassy in 
Moscow which had been in use for some years (Lardner, 
“Unbeatable Bugs”). In 1986 two marine guards admitted 
giving KGB agents access to the US embassy. Because of 
improved security procedures, however, the KGB do not 
seem to have gained access to the cipher room or other 
sensitive areas (Andrew and Gordievsky, KGB, p. 611).

41. After leaving GCHQ in 1977, Prime broke off contact 
with the KGB for the next three years. He had further 
meetings with his case officer in Vienna and Potsdam in 
1980 and 1981. His work as a Soviet agent came to light 
after he was arrested for sexually molesting little girls in 
1982. He was sentenced to thirtyfive years’ imprisonment 
for espionage and three for sexual assault (Andrew and 
Gordlevsky, KGB, pp. 526-8, 530-1). A senior GCHQ 
officer was later quoted as saying, “On the political side, 
there was a time up to the mid-1970s when we used to get 
useful [Soviet] political and high-level military 
communications. But that dried up, partly as a result of 
Prime.” (Urban, UK Eyes Alpha, p. 6.) Because Prime 
was a Third Directorate, not an FCD, agent, Mitrokhin did 



not have access to his file. The latest study of Prime, by 
the detective chief superintendent in charge of his case, is 
Cole, Geoffrey Prime.

of the Sixteenth Directorate, but indicate that it was in

record that “during the crisis in Lebanon the 
[Washington] residency was able to make a correct 
evaluation of the unfolding situation and inform the 
Centre on a timely basis that the United States had no 
plans for military intervention” (vol. 6, ch. 9). It is unclear 
which Lebanese crisis is referred to. Since the other 
material in this section of Mitrokhin’s notes deals with the 
mid-1970s, however, the reference is probably to 1974, 
when Israel made a series of air attacks against villages in 
southern Lebanon, which it suspected of harboring 
terrorists.

monitored continuously by the RAKETA post during the 
1970s were: 

• the radio link between surveillance vehicles 
and the six FBI posts responsible for observing the 
movements of Soviet personnel (167.4625 
megahertz); 

• the channel used by surveillance vehicles and 
observation posts monitoring the movements of 
members of Middle Eastern and some Western 
missions to the UN (167.2125 megahertz); 

• the channel used for communications between 
the FBI department investigating bank robberies and 
surveillance vehicles (167.6887 megahertz); 

• the channel used by those investigating other 
federal crimes (167.3756 megahertz); 



• the channel used for communications between 
the FBI despatch centers in New York and New 
Jersey (frequency in the 167 megahertz band not

(figures in thousands of hard currency roubles): 

Washington (POCHIN): 26.0 
New York (PROBA): 29.4 
San Francisco (VESNA): 6.7 

Ottawa (codename not recorded): figures unavailable 
(5.8 in 1977)

Tokyo (ZARYA); 10.4 

vol. 6, eh. 9; 1977 figures for Ottawa from vol. 8, ch. 5) 
Because of the KGB’s curious accounting methods, 
these figures doubtless do not represent the full running 
costs of the intercept posts. They do, however, give an 
approximate indication of the relative level of activity at 
each post. Other significant intercept posts, probably less 
important than those listed above, included Lisbon 
(ALTAY), Nairobi (KRYM), Cairo (ORION),The Hague 
(TULIP), Brussels (VEGA), Belgrade (PARUS), Hanoi 
(AMUR), Jakarta (DELFIN) and Damascus (SIGMA). 
Mitrokhin’s notes do not give the budgets for these posts.

Britain, the residency simply concocted a favorable reply 
without contacting any of its limited range of sources.

1. The role of the target in peacetime and 
wartime, and its place in the enemy’s military- 
industrial capabilities. Documents, photographs, 
films, maps and diagrams giving details on its 
location, work schedule, security system, personnel, 
neighbors, populated areas nearby and methods of 
approaching the target. 

2. Detailed descriptions of the target’s 



vulnerable points, methods of attacking each of 
them, estimates of the likely damage, and the type of 
personnel to be used in sabotage operations (agents, 
illegals, etc.). 

3. Opportunities to reconnoitre and sabotage the 
target. This section of the file contains individual 
reports {spravki) on every information source 
available on the target, and on each combat agent 
(agent-boyevik) selected for operations against it.

not the Roman numeral) noted by Mitrokhin was 
contained in order no. 00197 of October 7, 1965 
instructing other FCD departments with agents suitable 
for use in time of war or international crisis to hand them 
over to Department V. The Department had probably 
been founded not long before, vol. 2, app. 3.

135,000 dollars in February 1968, followed by 100,000 
dollars in March. Mitrokhin’ s notes on Greek Communist 
Party files for 1967, however, are very thin and it is likely 
that the first subsidies to the underground Party were 
handed over in Budapest during the later months of 1967.

its archives in the Soviet Union for safekeeping; see 
volume 2. 

16. k-14,531. The location for operation ZVENO was 
studied by the illegal YAKOV and the agent ROBBI of 
the Vienna residency. YAKOV was Gennadi 
Mikhailovich Alekseyev, based in Switzerland, who had 
assumed the identity of a Swiss man, Igor Miimer, who 
had died in the Soviet Union. In 1973 YAKOV was 
arrested by the Swiss authorities, who were unable to 
prove charges of espionage against him. He served two 
years in prison for using false identity documents (k- 
5,193; k-24,236). Mitrokhin is unable to identify ROBBI. 
Other KGB officers (at least three, and possibly all, from 
Department V) involved in preparations for operation 
ZVENO were Yu. V. Derzhavin, A. D. Grigoryev, B. N. 
Malinin, Ye. S. Shcherbanov, B. S. Olikheyko, A. S. 
Savin, Kovalik, and Ye. A. Sharov (k-14,531).

location of PEPEL as Istanbul, but neither reference 
identifies the type of special action employed in PEPEL. 



Mitrokhin did not see the PEPEL file. The 1969 report 
also noted that the 1955 requirement for the Thirteenth 
Department to steal Western military technology was out 
of date; this had become the primary responsibility of 
FCD Directorate T (Scientific and Technological 
Espionage). 

20. O’Riordan’s history of the Irish members of the 
International Brigades, Connolly Column, was printed in 
East Germany (though published in Dublin), and 
gratefully acknowledged the assistance of the Soviet agent 
and British defector to East Germany, John Peet. 

21. The text of O’Riordan’s appeal for weapons for the 
IRA is published in the appendix to Yeltsin, The View 
from the Kremlin, pp. 311-16. In December 1969, shortly 
before the split which led to the emergence of the 
Provisionals, a secret meeting of the IRA leadership 
approved a proposal by Goulding to establish a National 
Liberation Front including Sinn Fein, the Irish

allusion to the attempts to poison Amin’s food, which 
appears to have been the Eighth Department’s preferred 
method of assassination. According to Vladimir 
Kuzichkin, who defected from Directorate S a few years 
later, the first choice of assassin was an Azerbaijani 
illegal, Mikhail Talybov, who was bilingual in Farsi and 
had spent several years in Kabul with Afghan identity 
papers forged by the KGB. Equipped with poisons from 



the OTU laboratory, Talybov succeeded in gaining a job 
as a chef in the presidential palace. But, according to 
Kuzichkin, “Amin was as careful as any of the Borgias. 
He kept switching his food and drink as if he expected to 
be poisoned.” Kuzichkin, Inside the KGB, pp. 314-15; 
Kuzichkin, “Coups and Killings in Kabul,” Time 
(November 22, 1982); Barron, KGB Today, pp. 15-16. A

against Britain Part 1 


1. There is no support in any of the files seen by 
Mitrokhin that for the implausible theory that a major 
Soviet agent remained at work in MI5 after the demise of 
the Magnificent Five. Mitrokhin’ s notes contain no 
reference to Sir Roger Hollis, director-general of MI5, the 
most senior of the MI5 officers wrongly accused of being 
a Soviet agent. The Hollis story is now thoroughly 
discredited (Andrew and Gordievsky, KGB, p. 27).

5. vol. 7, ch. 14, item 17. Myakinkov’s name was wrongly 
transcribed by Mitrokhin as Mekin’kov. (CBEN) 

6. vol. 7, ch. 14, item 17. 

7. For legal reasons neither HUNT’S real identity nor the 
government departments for which he worked (included 
in Mitrokhin ’s notes) can be identified. HUNT’S first 
controller was V. E. Tseyrov (then also Norwood’s 
controller), followed by B. K. Stolenov and Yu. 



Kondratenko. After the mass expulsion of KGB and GRU 
personnel from London in 1971 HUNT was put on ice for 
several years as a security precaution. Contact was 
resumed in 1975 by MAIRE, an agent of the Paris 
residency. Following MAIRE ’s death in 1976, the 
London residency resumed control in 1977. HUNT’S last 
two case officers were V. V. Yaroshenko and A. N. 
Chemayev. In 1979, following HUNT’S establishment of 
a small business, his wife was recruited as a courier. By 
1981, however, the Centre was dissatisfied with the 
quality of HUNT’S intelligence and apparently fearful that 
he was under MI5 surveillance. Contact with him seems 
to have been broken at that point, vol. 7, ch. 14, item 16. 

8. Blake, No Other Choice, chs. 2-5. Cf Hyde, George 
Blake. Though acknowledging his affection and 
admiration for Curiel, Blake unconvincingly downplays 
his influence on him. According to Kalugin, Blake 
“already held far-leftist views at the outbreak of the 
Korean War” (Kalugin, Spymaster, p. 141.). For examples 
of other distortions in Blake’s memoirs, see Andrew and 
Gordievsky, KGB, pp. 755-6, n. 117); Murphy, 
Kondrashev and Bailey, Battleground Berlin, pp. 217, 
482-3, n. 36.

both on material made available by the SVR and on newly 
declassified CIA files, is Murphy, Kondrashev and 
Bailey, Battleground Berlin, ch. 1 1 and appendix 5, which 
corrects numerous errors in earlier accounts. Mitrokhin’s 
brief notes on the Berlin tunnel add nothing to 
Battleground Berlin.

17. vol. 7, ch. 14, item 3. Driberg had joined the 
Communist Party while at public school but was expelled 
in 1941 when, according to his entry in the Dictionary oj 
National Biography, the Party leadership “discovered that 
he was an agent of MI5, to which he had been recruited in 
the late 1930s” {Dictionary of National Biography, 1971- 
1980, p. 251). Though Driberg undoubtedly gave 
information to Maxwell Knight, a leading MI5 officer, 
much remains obscure about the relationship between 
them. According to Knight’s personal assistant, Joan 
Miller, he was a bisexual who, for a time, was “crazy” 



about Driberg. In her view, Driberg was only “a casual 
agent” who would “turn in a bit of stuff’ when Knight put 
pressure on him. (Interview with Joan Miller, Sunday 
Times Magazine (October 18, 1981); Miller, One GirTs 
War; Andrew, Secret Service, pp. 521-2.

most valuable agents. 

21. Driberg, Ruling Passions, p. 235. 

22. vol. 7, ch. 14, item 3. Mitrokhin’s notes on Driberg’s 
file record that he was “recruited in Moscow... chiefly on 
the basis of compromising material which recorded his 
homosexual relations with an agent,” but give no further 
details of the “compromising material.” 

23. vol. 7, ch. 14, item 3. 

24. Watkins’s comments are quoted in Wheen, Tom 
Driberg, p. 328. 

25. vol. 7, ch. 14, item 3. 

26. Wheen, Tom Driberg, pp. 292-315. Francis Wheen’s 
very readable and entertaining biography of Driberg 
dismisses all suggestion that his book on Burgess was 
influenced in any way by the KGB. Though shocked by 
the “stench” from the “acrid piss” of stories planted in the 
press by MI5 and MI6 {Tom Driberg, p. 317), Mr. Wheen 
failed to detect any unwholesome aroma emitting from 
the vast array of KGB active measures. Despite the SCD’s 



addiction to compromise operations, it also does not occur 
to him that the KGB might have exploited Driberg’s 
sexual adventures in Moscow lavatories. 

27. Driberg, Ruling Passions, p. 229. 

28. Driberg, Guy Burgess. 

29. According to Mitrokhin’s summary of Driberg’s KGB 
file, he was used for “the publication of KGB themes in 
the British press,” and “sent to the United States and other 
Western countries with a [KGB] brief’; vol. 7, ch. 14,

the future Labor leader, Michael Foot, with Tribune and 
the allegations made against him by the Sunday Times in 
1995, for which he received libel damages, it seems 
appropriate to add that Mitrokhin’s notes contain no 
reference to him.

as a trainee. Additional Line X officers were being 
selected for positions in the Moscow Narodnyy Bank and 
in an (unidentified) Anglo- Soviet organization. The 
number of Line X officers was seriously reduced as a 
result of the mass expulsion of September 1971. k-2, 124.

had held on to some of the classified documents he had 
obtained at Thom-EMI and given them to the KGB some 
time after he lost his security access in 1978. One or more 
of the payments recorded in his file may thus refer to a 
period after his loss of access. Since Mitrokhin’s notes 
end in 1984, the details of KGB payments to Smith 
cannot refer to his later years as a Soviet agent.

69. Mitrokhin did not note either Gott’s KGB file or 

references to other Guardian articles by him. His notes 
thus do not clarify the nature of Gott’s relationship with 
the KGB. Gott acknowledges having met KGB officers in 
London, Moscow, Vienna, Athens and Nicosia, but 
claims that the only money he received from them was to 
pay travel expenses to and in the last three locations.

unusually — recruited and run outside the UK by the KGB 
Third Directorate, to whose files Mitrokhin did not have 
access.

one- sentence reference to a SIGINT official (apparently 
British) codenamed ZHUR (JOUR), contacted in 1963 for 
the first time since 1938. Mitrokhin gives no indication 
whether or not the contact had any result. It is also 
possible that the reference was garbled, since the longest- 
serving agent providing intelligence on cipher systems, an 
employee of the French foreign ministry, was codenamed

his forged British passport to apply for an Australian visa; 
entry to New Zealand did not require a visa. From New 
Zealand he would need only Everett’s birth certificate to 
gain entry to Australia. Symonds, however, was unable to 
book a direct flight from Tokyo to New Zealand and was 
forced to use his bogus British passport as a transit 
passenger in Sydney. When flying from New Zealand to 
Australia later in the year, he used the same passport with 
an Australian visa obtained in Wellington, fearing that if 
he used Everett’s birth certificate an immigration service 
computer might detect that he had previously possessed a 
British passport containing the same name and date of 
birth, vol. 5, ch. 14, paras. 10- IE

British attacks, the battleship was finally sunk in 
November 1944 with the loss of 1,204 lives. 

24. TERENTY was the Czech Communist journalist 
Walter Taube. Mitrokhin’s note identifies VANYA as 
Vanek, a former Czech intelligence officer now working 
for the British. It is unclear whether “Vanek” is a 
forename or surname (k-26, 88).

name. Press reports after her arrest in December 1976 
identify her as Heidrun Hofer. 

68. k-8, 7, 177; k-18, 385. According to k-8, 177, ROSIE 
was recruited in October 1971; according to k-16, 108, 
she was recruited in 1973. The two dates probably refer, 
respectively, to the point at which she began to supply 
information to ROLAND, and to her meeting with 
VLADIMIR in February 1973, after which the importance 
of her role as an agent appears to have increased. 

69. k-16, 61. From 1970 to 1982 VLADIMIR was an 
illegal trainer based in Karlshorst, who performed various 
assignments in the GDR, FRG and Austria. His wife, Irina 
Yevseyevna (BERTA), was also an illegal.

down-to-earth women. Party members and loyal to their 
country, who were prepared to do this in return for... a 
preferential flat or an advance up the waiting list for a

After a conversation with the former Soviet ambassador

the services over there.” Falin later denied having made a 
specific reference to Wienand. Roger Boyes, “Brandt 
Papers Revive Spy Claims,” The Times (February 11, 
1995). The files seen by Mitrokhin contain no reference to 
a KGB attempt to recruit Wienand.

107. Brezhnev’s visit, however, led to enormous 
expenditure of KGB time and effort. Security procedures 
were overseen by a committee including the heads of no 
less than seven KGB directorates (Kryuchkov among 
them). Twenty-nine KGB and GRU operational groups 
were assigned to supervise Brezhnev’s security during the 
visit, k-5, 788-9. 

108. k- 8, 104. Soviet-FRG negotiations on the natural gas 
pipeline from Siberia were successfully concluded in 
November 1981. According to Sir Percy Cradock, later 
Mrs. Thatcher’s foreign policy adviser, the Reagan 
administration “found in the Polish crisis [of December 
1981] a convenient pretext for sabotaging an agreement 
they did not like. Their action was at first confined to US 



companies, but in June 1982 it was extended, with little 
thought for the consequences, to US subsidiaries and 
foreign companies as well.” After vigorous protests by 
Mrs. Thatcher as well as by Schmidt, the United States 
backed down in November 1982 in return for NATO 
acceptance of greater restrictions on trade with the Soviet 
Union. Cradock, In Pursuit of British Interests, p. 56. 

109. k-8, 104. 

110. Mitrokhin did not have access to the SCD files 
which reveal the agent’s name. 

111. k-13, 44. Mitrokhin ’s notes do not record any 
response by the Schmidt government. 

112. k-19, 282. The active measures against Strauss give 
the lie to Wolf ’s suggestions since the publication of his 
memoirs that Strauss was an HVA informant. 

113. k-5, 718, k-19, 282. Inge Goliath had been 
withdrawn to the GDR in 1979. Mitrokhin’ s notes 
summarize, but give few details about, a series of other 
KGB active measures designed to compromise the BND 
and BfV: operation JUNGLE, conducted jointly with the 
HVA from 1978 onwards to discredit the BND and 
disrupt its relations with other Western intelligence 
services (k-13, 61, 82, 102-3); operations ZHAK-RUZH, 
ROZA, BURGUNDER, OSMAN and PANTER (1978), 
designed, again in co-operation with the HVA, “to expose 
and impede the activity of the ERG special services in 
Europe and in the Near East” (k-13, 61); operation 
ONTARIO (1978), “to cause disagreements between the 



CIA, the SDECE and the END” (k-13, 79); operation 
JAMES (1980), “to exacerbate disagreements between the 
END and the CIA” (k-13, 102); operation KLOP (1981), 
to discredit the EfV (k-13, 85); operation ORKESTR 
(1981), to discredit West German journalists who were 
alleged to be END officers or co-optees (k-13, 86); and 
operation DROTIK (1981), to compromise Western 
businesses allegedly used by the CIA and the END as 
cover and for other operational purposes (k-13, 87).

computers were relaxed during the Gorbachev era, fears 
that they were bugged or deliberately infected with 



viruses continued. Nikolai Brusnitsin, deputy chairman of 
the State Technical Commission, complained in 1990 that 
the software in a West German computer sold to a Soviet 
shoe-making factory had been deliberately pre- 
programmed to self-destruct. There had, he claimed, been 
a whole series of such incidents. Brusnitsin, Openness 
and Espionage, pp. 28-9.

1. k-4, 91-9, 101. The 1953 list of “valuable agents” in 
Paris also includes the codename MBS, but gives no 
indication of his or her occupation. The only codenames 
which can be identified on the basis of information in 
Mitrokhin’s notes are PIZHO (Georges Paques) and 
LONG (Paddy Costello). It is quite possible, however, 
that the other “valuable agents” include some of those 
recruited under other codenames during the few years 
after the Liberation. Paques ’s most important period as a 
Soviet agent almost certainly came while he was working 
at the French general staff from 1958 to 1962.

importance. 

18. k-7, 178. After her false flag recruitment, ROZA was 
controlled by a female agent, JEANNETTE, who 
doubtless posed as a member of the fictitious

27. k-4, 131. The LOUISA case, unlike those of Dejean 



and Guibaud, figured in the FCD files seen by Mitrokhin 
because of the unsuccessful attempt by the Paris residency 
to renew contact with her. 

28. NN’s name is not recorded in Mitrokhin ’s notes but 
can be identified from the biographical detail contained in 
them as Saar-Demichel; vol. 9, ch. 6, para. 5. Saar- 
Demichel later admitted his links with the KGB; Wolton, 
La France sous influence, p. 247. According to Wolton, 
his original KGB codename was ALEKSEI.

34. Mitrokhin’ s notes contain no reference to the radical 
(later socialist) politician Charles Hemu, who was to 
become defense minister from 1981 to 1985. It has been 
alleged that Hemu was recmited by the Bulgarian DS in 
1953, later had contact with the Romanian Securitate and 
became a KGB agent in 1963. Dupuis and Pontaut, 
“Charles Hemu etait un agent de I’Est.” 

35. k-6, 80, 128; t-1, 61. For legal reasons GILBERT’S 
identity, though recorded in Mitrokhin ’s notes on KGB 
files, cannot be published. There is some indication that at 
one point GILBERT avoided contact with his case officer. 

36. For legal reasons DROM’s identity, though recorded 
in Mitrokhin’ s notes on KGB files, cannot be published. 



His file fills seven volumes. DROM’s controllers were, 
successively, Spartak Ivanovich Leshchev (codenamed 
LARIN) from I960 to 1964; Vladimir Filippovich 
Yashchechkin (YASNOV) from 1964 to 1967; Yuri

lost his influence at the Elysee. De Gaulle is reported to 
have said to a member of his entourage, “Saar-Demichel 
is a Soviet spy. He doesn’t, of course, steal secrets to hand 
over to them, but he tells them everything he knows.”

45. During the period 1963-6 three unidentified French 
intelligence officers were members of the GRANIT 
group, and one of the BULAT group. BON, a former head 
of department at the Surete Generate, worked as an agent 
recruiter; k-27, 242. The latest reference in Mitrokhin’s 
notes to penetration of SDECE is to the presence there of 
a KGB agent (not identified) in May 1969; k-4, 81.

48. vol. 9, ch. 6, para. 10. Mitrokhin’s notes give few 
details of the regular (non-bonus) payments to these 
agents. 

49. Mitrokhin’s notes on his file do not specify what 
proportion of the large sums paid to him were in the form 
of a regular salary or retainer, but they do make clear that 
he received very substantial bonuses for particularly 
important items of S&T (k-5, 460).

57. The six cipher personnel under cultivation were 
codenamed ALMAZOV, GROMOV, GUDKOV, 
KRASNOV, LAPIN and VESELOV. Mitrokhin gives 
details of only two. The cultivation of LAPIN began in 
1980 and plans were made for it to continue after he was 
posted abroad in 1982. With the assistance of JOUR, an 
investigation was undertaken of KRASNOV’ s finances, 
home and leisure pursuits, and he was secretly 
photographed. At the end of 1981 an (unidentified) illegal 



began to cultivate him under false flag. Mitrokhin’s notes 
do not record which, if any, of the cultivations ended in 
recruitment; k-4, 177.

73. For the two years 1976-7, BROK was paid a total of 
217,000 francs: 72,000 francs basic salary, 83,000 
bonuses, 62,000 expenses. From January to November 
1978, the last period for which details of payments to 
BROK are available, he received a total of 182,000 
francs: 55,000 francs salary, 83,000 bonuses, 62,000 
expenses, k-3, 81. 

74. Mitrokhin does not identify BROK’s case officer(s) 
for the period 1946-51. Thereafter, his controllers were 



Ye. R. Radtsig (1951-7); V. K. Radchenko (1957-9); E. 
N. Yakovlev (1959-63); 1. F. Gremyakin (1970-2); L. 1.

81. ( July 3, 1975). 

82. Le Monde (September 12, 1975). This claim was 
subsequently withdrawn, but Le Monde' ^ critics 
complained that it continued, in its reporting on 
Solzhenitsyn, to ''prodiguer impunement quelques insultes 
sous le convert de I’objectiviteF Fegris, Le Monde tel 
qu HI est, p. 32. 

83. A major operational plan for 1975, jointly signed by 
the heads of the First Chief, Second Chief and Fifth 
Directorates, aimed “to discredit PAUK [Solzhenitsyn] ... 
through mass information media abroad.” k-3b, 27. 

84. Fegris, Le Monde tel qu HI est. 

85. Jacques Thibau’s analysis of Le Monde in the 1970s 



concludes: il repose d la fois sur ce que ses 

adversaires ‘de gauche ’ appellent I ’ordre, et ses critiques 
‘de droite ’ la subversion. L ’equilibre est difficile a tenir. 
II requiert de la prudence et de la pratique de la 
casuistique, mais globalement il correspond a la fonction 
du journal.'' TWodiU, Le Monde, 1944-1996, p. 433. 

86. However, at least one regular Paris-based contributor 
to Le Monde in the 1970s, KRON, is identified as a KGB 
agent (k-24, 153). Mitrokhin’s notes also identify 
MONGO, one of Le Monde' ^ African correspondents, as 
a KGB agent, but do not give his identity or the dates 
when he was posted in Africa (k-6, 116). 

87. t-1, 46, 58; vol. 9, ch. 6, paras. 15, 24. Most of 

Mitrokhin’s notes on influence operations directed against 
Le Monde are both brief and general. He identifies only 
two active measures articles by both author and exact date 
of publication. One is described as “entirely written on 
KGB themes” by a leading journalist; the other 

was an article “using KGB arguments” by a leading 
socialist politician. Both were published in 1980. vol. 1, 
ch. 8; vol. 9, ch. 6, paras. 15, 24; k-8, 522; k-24, 153. 

88. vol. 9, ch. 2, para. 23. 

89. The same disproportion in the treatment of KGB and 
CIA active measures is evident, on a somewhat smaller 
scale, in the generally valuable history of Le Monde by 
Jacques Thibau. Thibau concludes, for example, that one 
notorious forgery published by Le Monde, the so-called 
“Fechteler report,” which purported to reveal 



outrageously belligerent US designs in the Mediterranean, 
was almost certainly fabricated by the CIA and French 
intelligence. He does not consider the far more probable 
hypothesis that it was a KGB forgery (Thibau, Le Monde, 
1944-1996, pp. 214-18). For an assessment of the 
revelations in the mid-1970s of malpractice by the US 
intelligence community, see Andrew, For the President 's 
Eyes Only, ch. 10. 

90. SIDOR was recruited in 1956 but later suspected of 
working for the DST (k-14, 3). JACQUES, an AFP 
correspondent in a number of Asian countries, was a KGB 
agent from 1964 to 1973; during that period he had seven 
different controllers (k-6, 53). MISHA was recruited 
during a visit to the Soviet Union in 1965; Mitrokhin’s 
notes do not reveal how long his work as an agent 
continued (vol. 2, app. 1, para. 46; vol. 2, appendix 2, 
para. 68). LAN was an agent from 1969 to 1979, mostly 
— if not exclusively — in France (k-4, 85; k-27, 291). 
MARAT was an agent in Paris and abroad from c. 1973 to 
1982 (k-6, 42). GRININ was recruited in 1980 (k-14, 
379). 

91. PIERRE, a confidential contact in the 1960s (k-14, 
111, 134), and JOSEPH, a confidential contact from 1974 
to 1977 (k-6, 84).

referred to at Pathe’s trial by his alias, “Kuznetsov.” The 
Paris residency believed that the DST had not succeeded 
in identifying him as the son of the former head of the 
FCD; k-5, 560. 

99. Like DURANT, NANT, VERONIQUE, 
JACQUELINE and NANCY are identified in Mitrokhin’s 
notes, but cannot be named for legal reasons; vol. 9, ch. 6,

had begun with the publication by one satirical weekly Le 
Canard Enchaine on October 10, 1979 of an order placed 
by Bokassa six years earlier for the purchase of a diamond 
plaquette for Giscard d’Estaing. The Elysee tried to fend 
off this and similar stories over the next year and a half 
until it finally announced on March 23, 1981, just over a 
month before the first round of the presidential election, 
that diamonds given to Giscard in 1973, 1974 and 1975 
had been valued at 115,000 francs and that this sum had 
been donated to the Red Cross and other good causes in 



the Central African Republic.

109. vol. 9, ch. 6, para. 3. 

110. k-3, 81. BROK was not the only French journalist on 
whom the KGB radically revised its views. In 1979 the 
Centre concluded that LAN was providing “material not 
qualitatively different from material published in the 
press,” and broke off contact with him. k-27, 291. 

111. vol. 9, ch. 6, para. 3 . 

112. The statistics for Line X operations in European 
residencies in 1975 were as follows (figures for Line X 
officers certainly refer to 1975; those for agents are for 
approximately — ^probably exactly — 1975):

These statistics were compiled by the Second 
Department of FCD Directorate T, which was responsible 
for Line X operations in the residencies listed above. The 
figures for the Bonn residency account for only a part of 
Line X operations in the FRG; Line X operations were 
also run from Cologne. Line X in Karlshorst, which came 
under a different department of Directorate T, had fifty- 
nine agents in 1975 (k-5, 416). A probable majority of 
Line X operations in Vienna (which Mitrokhin’s notes do 



not make it possible to quantify) were directed at non- 
Austrian targets. 

113. k-5, 383, 386, 406. Though Mitrokhin’s notes give 
no later statistics, it is possible that the 1977 record was 
subsequently surpassed. 

114. Mitrokhin’s notes give the following incomplete 
statistics of Line X officers stationed in European 
residencies for all or part of the period 1974-9: 


Belgrade 

4

115. Line X in Paris also succeeded in penetrating an 
unquantifiable number of US companies and subsidiaries 
in France. 

116. k-5, 460. 

117. Though Mitrokhin’s note merely records that 
Andropov recommended the award of the Order of the 
Red Star, it is barely conceivable that the recommendation 
was turned down. Kesarev’s assistant, Yuri Ignatyevich 
Rakovsky, was recommended for accelerated promotion. 
k-5, 470. 

118. Mitrokhin noted the following payments to ALAN 
which were recorded in his file: 409,000 francs for the 
period 1973 to 1976 (probably his basic salary with 
additional sums for particular items); 100,000 francs 
(undated) for information on the design of infra-red 
detectors; 40,000 francs (also undated) for samples of the 
detectors; 50,000 francs in September 1973 for two 
samples of missileguidance systems; payments of 71,000 
and 100,000 francs in 1974 for technical documentation; 
40,000 francs in 1974 or 1975 for unidentified technical 
samples; 89,400 francs (purpose unspecified) in 1975; 



110.000 francs in 1977 for documentation on missile 
guidance; 60,000 francs and approximately 200,000 
francs (30,000 convertible roubles) in December 1977 
(purpose unspecified); and 200,000 francs (purpose 
unspecified) in mid- 1978. On the assumptions that these 
were all separate sums and that there were no other 
payments unrecorded by Mitrokhin, this would make a 
grand total of 1,429,400 francs, k-5, 460. 

119. k-5, 460. 

120. Favier and Martin-Roland, La decennie Mitterrand,

121. Bourdiol was arrested in 1983 and later sentenced to 
five years’ imprisonment, as a result of intelligence 
provided by the French agent FAREWELL. Wolton, Le 
KGB en France, p. 245; “Ariane: un ingenieur fran^ais 
incarcere pour F espionage,” Liberation, (December 2, 
1983); Early Warning (March 2, 1984); Reuter reports ( 
June 16, 1987). There is no identifiable reference to 
Bourdiol in Mitrokhin ’s notes. 

122. Mitrokhin’ s incomplete notes on payments to KARL 
record that from January to November 1979 he was paid a 
monthly salary of 13,200 francs and an additional sum of 

32.000 francs; and that from January to October he was 
paid 12,000 francs a month plus a single payment of 

34.000 francs. KARL worked as a KGB agent from 1972 
to 1982. k-5, 367-9. 

123. k-5, 367. 

124. On the FAREWELL case, see Wolton, Le KGB en 



France, part 5, and Brook- Shepherd, The Storm Birds, ch. 
17. FAREWELL was first identified as Vetrov in Andrew 
and Gordievsky, Le KGB dans le monde, pp. 619-23. 

125. Raymond Nart, head of the DST Soviet section, 
writing under the pseudonym Henri Regnard, gave the 
first public account of what had been learned from the 
FAREWELL operation in December 1983 in an article 
published in the journal Defense Nationale. 

126. President Mitterrand, whose mind turned naturally to 
conspiracy, subsequently began to suspect bizarrely that 
the FAREWELL information might somehow have been 
planted on the DST by the CIA “as a way of testing 
socialist France and me personally,” in order to see 
whether he would hold it back or pass it on to the Reagan 
administration. Favier and Martin-Roland, La decennie 
Mitterrand, vol. 1, pp. 94-8, 271-3. 

127. Mitrokhin’s notes contain the following comparative

On January 1, 1975 the Rome residency had 23 agents 



(18 of them active) and 6 confidential contacts, as well as 
4 agents in the Soviet community. A year later it had 21 
non-Soviet agents (16 active), 7 confidential contacts and 
9 Soviet agents (k-13, 135). 

128. See above, chapter 17. 

129. See above, chapter 17. 

130. Mitrokhin’s notes do not include any examples of the 
intelligence obtained by DARIO and his female recruits 
from the Foreign Ministry. 

131. k-10, 101-3, 107, 109. Mitrokhin’s notes imply in 
1956 that DARIO was also instrumental in the 
recruitment of MAGDA, an employee of the foreign 
ministry press department; k-10, 100, 103. Mitrokhin’s 
notes also record the recruitment in 1970 of an agent in 
the Foreign Ministry, codenamed STRELOK, by Georgi 
Pavlovich Antonov. STRELOK subsequently became 
“reluctant to co-operate” (k-4, 80, 158; k-2, 221, 231, 
268). 

132. k-16, 285. Mitrokhin notes that by 1965 LEDA “had 
lost her intelligence access.” 

133. k-10, 97, 109. 

134. k-10, 109. 

135. See above, chapter 17. 

136. k-10, 63. Mitrokhin’s notes do not give the date at 
which the various ciphers and surveillance lists were 
handed over by QUESTOR. In view of the Centre’s 
dissatisfaction with the declining amount of intelligence 
obtained from QUESTOR by YEFRAT in the later 1950s, 



however, the bulk of the material was probably handed 
over in the mid-1950s. 

137. Mitrokhin interpreted YEFRAT’s file as placing the 
responsibility for the bankruptcy of the Italian firm on his 
mismanagement (k-7, 4, 193; k-16, 338, 419; k-18, 153; 
k-20, 94). In addition to being assisted by his wife 
TANYA, YEFRAT was given as deputy resident the 
illegal Aleksandr Vasilyevich Subotin (codenamed PIK), 
who had gained an Italian passport in the name of Adolfo 
Tolmer (k-16, 98, 285). 

138. YEFRAT also cultivated CENSOR’S wife, KAPA; 
Mitrokhin’ s notes do not record the outcome of the 
cultivation (k-16, 419; k-18, 153). 

139. YEFRAT later took part in PROGRESS operations. 
In 1962 DEMID recruited his brother TIBER, who 
worked in the accounts department of the interior 
ministry, to act as radio operator for SAUL, a Lithuanian 
Catholic priest and KGB agent then studying at the 
Vatican. DEMID, CENSOR and QUESTOR continued to 
provide intelligence until at least 1963 (k-16, 419; k-10, 
63; k-5, 688-91). After YEFRAT’s departure, his former 
deputy, PIK, worked for the legal Rome residency until 
1965, acting as LEDA’s controller from February 1962 to 
September 1963 (k-16, 285). 

140. k-2, 66. Mitrokhin ’s notes give no indication of 
whether IKAR continued to work as a KGB agent after 
his return to Italy.

were not the only SCD recruits in the Italian embassy in 
Moscow. Mitrokhin’s notes also refer to the case of 
POLATOV (or POLETOV), an assistant service attache, 
recruited by the SCD in the late 1970s, but give no details 
(k-10, 124). There may have been further embassy agents 
not mentioned in Mitrokhin’s notes. 

Other Italians recruited by the SCD in Moscow 
included an official in the legal department of the Italian 
interior ministry, recruited with the assistance of VERA, a 
swallow from the Polish SB (k-2, 273); and RITA, a 
female employee of the Fiat company recruited in 1976 
(k-10, 132).

notes as Line X agents in the 1970s and/or early 1980s 
were CHIZ (k-14, 567), ERVIN (k-7, 37), KOZAK (k-14, 
174), METIL (k-14, 383), PAN (k-12, 593) and TELINI 
(k-12, 389). It is unclear whether SAUST, a business 
consultant cultivated by the KGB, was actually recruited 
(k-14, 568). 



151. Mitrokhin’s notes identify a total of seventeen Line 
X officers stationed at the Rome residency for all or part 
of the period 1974-9 (k-5, 459). 

152. k-5, 353, 425. The Soviet ambassador in Rome, N. S. 
Rhyzov, had opposed the establishment of a Soviet 
consulate in Milan in order to provide cover for a KGB 
residency in northern Italy, but the foreign ministry in 
Moscow gave way to pressure from the Centre (k-5, 422).

172. k-13, 148. The active measures statistics were much 
in line with those for the previous two years. In 1975 the 
Rome residency reported that “3 documentary [forged 
document] operations were carried out; 10 conversations 
of influence were held; 1 press conference, 1 conference 
[were arranged]; 4 oral reports were disseminated; 48 
articles were published; 6 questions were asked in 
Parliament; 1 delegation was assembled and sent out; 4 
appeals were drafted; 4 mailing operations were carried 
out; an Italy- Spain committee was set up; 2 leaflet 
operations were carried out and 2 anonymous letters were 
sent out” (k-13, 135). The active measures statistics for 
1976 were as follows: 



articles placed [in the press] : 63 
conversations of influence: 6 
appeals made: 9 
working group organized: 1 
booklet distributed: 1 
leaflet operation carried out: 1 
anonymous letters distributed: 2 
demonstration held: 1 
parliamentary questions: 2 
question in the Senate: 1 
“Round Table” meeting held: 1 

Of the total number of articles printed, 28 of the press 
articles were designed to discredit the Main Adversary; 2 1 
alleged CIA interference in Italian affairs. The residency 
also claimed to have made “active use” of the “Italy- 
Spain” committee. Four active measures operations were 
intended “to discredit Maoism as an anti-socialist 
tendency.” k-13, 151. 

173. Mitrokhin’s notes probably contain only an 
incomplete record of new agents recruited by the Rome 
residency during the period 1977-83. Among them, 
however, were ARO, who worked for the Ansaldo 
company in Genoa and was recruited at some point 
between 1978 and 1981 (k-14, 439); CLEMENT, a 
member of the international department of the Christian 
Association of Italian Workers (ACLI), recruited in 1978 
but put on ice in 1981 after he had failed to supply 



intelligence of much significance (k-14, 395); KARS, an 
Italian physicist who worked as a Line X agent in both 
Italy and the United States in the early 1980s (k-14, 264; 
vol. 6, app. 1, part 40); KOK, a sinologist recruited in 
1977 for operations against the PRC (k-13, 153); and 
KOZAK, the owner of an Italian engineering company, 
who was recruited not later than 1978 (k-14, 174).

theorists who saw the Jehovah’s Witnesses as vehicles for 
American ideological subversion was the fact that, from 
the First World War to the war in Vietnam, they 
consistently represented the largest group of Americans 
imprisoned for conscientious objection. In 1918 their 
leaders were imprisoned for contravening the American 
Espionage Act, though their sentences were overturned on 
appeal. Penton, Apocalypse Delayed, pp. 55-6, 142.

25. At the time, opinions within the Centre were divided 
on whether the KGB had been involved in the 
assassination attempt. About half the FCD officers with 
whom Oleg Gordlevsky discussed the attempt were 
convinced that the KGB would no longer contemplate 
such a risky special action, even if it were subcontracted 
to the Bulgarian intelligence service. The other half, 
however, suspected that Department 8 of Directorate S, 
which was responsible for assassinations, had been 
involved; some told Gordlevsky they only regretted that 
the attempt had failed. (Andrew and Gordlevsky, KGB, p. 
639.)

Kania’s sacking, “We noticed that lately a difference 
began to appear between Kania and Jamzelski in their 
approaches to basic questions. Jamzelski began to show 
more and more readiness to accept violent measures in 
dealing with counter-revolution. We began to work with 
Jamzelski. When doing this, we were influenced by the 
fact that Jamzelski possessed greater authority in the army 
and also enjoyed the support of the ministers” (k-20, 338).

Conclusion. Front the One-Party State to 
the Yeltsin Presidency 


1. Jukes, “The Soviets and ‘Ultra.’ ” Though Jukes ’s 
conclusions are debatable, his 1988 article remains a 
pathbreaking study. 

2. Kennedy-Pipe, Russia and the World, 1917-1991. Dr. 
Kennedy-Pipe’s otherwise valuable book is only one 
example of the continuing underestimation of the role of 
Soviet foreign intelligence even in some of the most 
recent work by leading Western scholars. 

3. The significance of SIGINT was made clear by David 
Kahn’s pioneering The Codebreakers, published in 1967. 
Though a bestseller, however, its contents appeared to 
stun, rather than to inspire, most historians of 
international relations. 

4. A growing minority of international relations, history 
and other departments in British universities now offer 
courses on intelligence, though on a much smaller scale 
than in north America. There is a flourishing British 
Study Group on Intelligence, with a largely academic 
membership, and an increasing number of similar groups 



in north America and continental Europe. 

5. Orwell, Nineteen Eighty-Four, p. 7. 

6. Hosking, A History of the Soviet Union, p. 219. 

7. Two of the leading historians of the Bolshevik 
Revolution, Orlando Figes and Richard Pipes, agree on 
describing the Cheka as “a state within a state.” 

8. Volkogonov, The Rise and Fall of the Soviet Empire, 
pp. 73-4. 

9. Conquest, The Great Terror, pp. 468-70. It was a sign 
of the difficulty encountered by many Western historians 
in interpreting the Terror that Conquest’s was the only 
full-scale history of it published during the life of the 
Soviet Union. 

10. Ostryakov, Voyennye Chekisty, p. 258. 

11. k-25, 78. On the punitive use of psychiatry in the 
Soviet Union, see Bloch and Reddaway, Russia 's 
Political Hospitals. 

12. k-25, 79. There is no suggestion in Mitrokhin’s notes 
that Voloshanovich was working for the KGB. 

13. See above, chapter 20. 

14. frag. 1,7. Mitrokhin’s notes give no details of the 
precise charges leveled against Korobov or of the length 
of his sentence. 

15. k-3b, 136. 

16. I am grateful to Dr. Clarissa de Waal of Newnham 
College, Cambridge, for these recollections of Tirana in 
1992. 

17. A further 3 percent were KGB co-optees. 



18. t-7, 284. 

19. t-7, 286. The behavior of the informers should not, in 
most cases, be harshly judged. Those who refused 
invitations to inform were likely to incur the ill will of the 
KGB towards themselves and their families. 

20. frag. 5, 3. 

21. Kalugin, Spymaster, pp. 287-98. 

22. See above, chapter 20. 

23. Kissinger subsequently acknowledged that Senator 
Pat Moynihan had been an exception. “Your crystal ball,” 
he told him, “was better than mine.” Moynihan, Secrecy, 

p. 6. 

24. For example, the Russian sections of Eric 
Hobsbawm’s brilliant history of the twentieth century. 
Age of Extremes, include no mention of any of the heads 
of the Cheka and its successors, save for a passing 
reference to Andropov’s career before becoming General 
Secretary as “chief of the security apparatus” (p. 476). 

25. There is, however, a one-line reference to Andropov’s 
subsequent emergence as Soviet leader in Vance’s 
reflections on the period after his resignation (Vance, 
Hard Choices, p. 421). 

26. Gorbachev, however, acknowledged that, eighteen 
months or two years earlier, the coup might have 
succeeded.

generally admirable study appeared in 1997.

policy which make no mention of these aspects of it.

57. vol. 6, ch. 10. Mitrokhin’s notes do not give the names 
of the operational officers assigned to the Karpov- 
Korchnoi match. Korchnoi’s official “second,” the British 
grandmaster Raymond Keene, believed that the head of 
the Soviet delegation at the championship, V. D. 



Baturinsky, was a KGB colonel (Keene, Karpov- 
Korchnoi 1978, p. 32). Korchnoi gives an account of his 
defection and career up to the 1978 world championship 
in his autobiography, Chess is My Life. 

58. Keene, Karpov-Korchnoi 1978, pp. 56, 147-9, 153-4. 
During the rematch between Korchnoi and Karpov at 
Merano, Italy, in 1981, the KGB established a dedicated 
cipher communication circuit to report on the progress of 
matches and arranged a shuttle service between the Rome 
residency and the KGB operational group covering the 
World Chess Championship. No fewer than fourteen 
active measures were implemented in an attempt once 
again to ensure Korchnoi’s defeat (k-5, 921). The 
undercover KGB advance party at Merano claimed to be 
monitoring the drinking water, the climate, noise levels, 
even levels of radioactivity (Kasparov, Child of Change, 
p. 76). Korchnoi, then past his best and, at fifty, a 
relatively elderly challenger for the world title, lost by 
eleven points to seven. 

59. Karpov’s eventual conqueror in the 1985 world 
championship, Gary Kasparov, has made much of the 
obstacles placed in his path by the Soviet establishment. 
He himself, however, owed much to the support of the 
head of the Azerbaijan KGB, Geidar Alyev. Lawson, The 
Inner Game, p. 17; Kasparov, Child of Change, p. 79.

Stalinist. New words were not devised until 1977.
