Note:
Before starting make sure you check the "Check to speak" button,
increase the volume from 0. (default)
To start either you need to press forward (>>) button or pause (||) button.
There is no option to pause in between sentences, 
so you will need to restart the program to stop.
It reads the content displayed and then waits for next command, 
no autoplay or breaks in between has been programmed yet.
